00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 align:start position:0%

Edna I'm opening the public hearing on
 
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 144 in call the prime sponsor
 
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
representative groa thank you chair
 
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
Maguire I'm Jackie groa I'm the state
 
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative Rockingham District 24
 
00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
and I'm introducing House Bill 144 at
 
00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
the request of the board of dental
 
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
examiners when they were reviewing their
 
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
rule making versus statute they found a
 
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
deficiency in that the rule
 
00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
making allows hygienist to use nitrous
 
00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
oxide and local
 
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
anesthesia but it doesn't in the um stat
 
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
you give them that Authority and it also
 
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't um give any requirements for
 
00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
that so this bill is really just a bill
 
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
that marriages Ru making and statute
 
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 align:start position:0%
efficiency okay thank you very much are
 
00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
there any questions by the
 
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
you all right is there anyone else who
 
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
144 represent yeah if you don't
 
00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 align:start position:0%
representative Gro where' you go uh I
 
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
guess I'm just
 
00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
I didn't quite follow that
 
00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 align:start position:0%
uh but it's early so it's it's later
 
00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 align:start position:0%
than you it's later than you think the
 
00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
they weren't doing Stu the rules were
 
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
deficient they wanted they weren't doing
 
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
stuff beyond their scope were were they
 
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 align:start position:0%
is that the implication
 
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
here no they were not doing things
 
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
beyond their scope but the fact that let
 
00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 align:start position:0%
me read you the exact thing the
 
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
administration of nitrous okay the board
 
00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
found a discrepancy between hygienists
 
00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 align:start position:0%
who administer nitrous oxide and those
 
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
who administer local anesthesia the
 
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
statute requires special education and
 
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
examination to obtain a permit to
 
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
administer nitrous oxide but the statute
 
00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
appears to include the administration of
 
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
local anesthesia and the practice of
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
dental hygienist without any further
 
00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
so you want you want this additional
 
00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
education there's a certain amount of
 
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
training that they have and that they
 
00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
should have and they want to put that in
 
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
statute yes okay all
 
00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 align:start position:0%
right okay any other question pitech the
 
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
other question I have isn't for you does
 
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
anybody still use nitrous
 
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
oxide I have no idea I don't i' like to
 
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
hear if somebody's somebody's nodding
 
00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
their head in the back so I think it's
 
00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.350 align:start position:0%
their head in the back so I think it's
possible

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 align:start position:0%

name is Lori Rosado I'm a practicing

dentist here in um conquer and I'm the
 
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh Council for governmental Affairs for
 
00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Dental society's um well
 
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
chair yes nitrous oxide is used in New
 
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's used everywhere um mostly
 
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
in sedation settings obviously like an
 
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
oral surgeon's office but many general
 
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
dentist office still use it safely okay
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
and to what representative Gro was
 
00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
saying um the this is already being
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
practiced by hygienist as a profession
 
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
practice safely and within their scope
 
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
they just want to make the rule
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
statute this is a board request okay
 
00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions or L um
 
00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you um
 
00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
it sounds like what we're doing is
 
00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
making sure that the board can ensure
 
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
that they are qualified to do what
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
they're doing because right now the
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
statute says they can do it but there's
 
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
no qualifications is that correct I'm
 
00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
not I just want to be clear that I'm not
 
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of the board but yes
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
that's how I read it thank you thank you
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
all right is there anyone else who
 
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.309 align:start position:0%
 
hearing

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%

minute
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
motion no um I I I can just say that
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
this is at the request of the board of
 
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
dental hygienist to make that to um put
 
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
into statute what they have in Ru making
 
00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 align:start position:0%
okay repr land do you to speak to your
 
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
second uh yes this seems to increase the
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
protection for patients by having the
 
00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:00.759 align:start position:0%
practice actually being held to
 
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
standards put into law and um I'm
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
looking forward to this passing okay is
 
00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
there any U anyone else comments
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
questions concerns representative
 
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 align:start position:0%
please hit the button but it didn't work
 
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
you know how technology is in old people
 
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.029 align:start position:0%
you know how technology is in old people
anyway

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
um so uh the the important aspect here
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
that was briefly alluded to but uh it
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be in all our Consciousness is
 
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
that they have to be
 
00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
examined uh to demonstrate that they've
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
had the training and that they're
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
proficient in the application so um
 
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
That's the basis for the board to
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
require that thank
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
you anyone else
 
00:07:59.790 --> 00:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
representers thank you madam chair so I
 
00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:02.199 align:start position:0%
have a question to the have we had a
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
problem in this area where H H no okay
 
00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
as far as I know there was an audit of
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
the uh Dental Board two or three years
 
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
ago and it pointed out there were a
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
number of discrepancies between the
 
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
rules and the statute and this is just
 
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
one case of fixing that
 
00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
discrepancy as far as I know one follow
 
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
so I it just seems like we're I I
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
licensing and and that aspect of things
 
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519 align:start position:0%
it seems like we're adding we keep
 
00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
adding and adding where I
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
know Governor spu previously was trying
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
to get rid of rid of so I'm just curious
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
yeah but I don't think we're going to
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
repeal the license for dental
 
00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
hygienists and if we're continuing to
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
license them this is to re um require
 
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
them to be trained which you're right it
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
does seem redundant and not necessary so
 
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
feel free to vote against the bill it's
 
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
it it's keeping the paperwork straight
 
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
and that's about all it's
 
00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:19.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519 align:start position:0%

itself thank you represent scitech for
 
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
the record was this a request yes
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
questions okay in that case I will call
 
00:48:22.829 --> 00:48:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
board thank you and good morning my name
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
is Abby svard I am registered dietitian
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
and current chair of the board of
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
licensed dietitians I am here
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
representing the board and providing
 
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
information surrounding HB
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
145 I wanted to briefly discuss the role
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
that dietitians play in the state of New
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as we are all likely aware
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
nutrition is present in our lives every
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
single day and the sources of
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
information that exist through news and
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
media in particular continue to make it
 
00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
difficult to differentiate what is true
 
00:48:56.829 --> 00:48:56.839 align:start position:0%
and what are myths and falsities in the
 
00:48:58.109 --> 00:48:58.119 align:start position:0%
world of food and
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
nutrition there are often less qualified
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
individuals providing nutrition
 
00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:04.839 align:start position:0%
information and education to the public
 
00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
with li limited evidence-based backing
 
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
our rsas specifically 326 H2 speak to
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
the understanding of the value and the
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
role that dietitians play in treating
 
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
illness injury in other medical
 
00:49:21.309 --> 00:49:21.319 align:start position:0%
conditions and improving the overall
 
00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:22.839 align:start position:0%
quality of
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
life it also speaks upon the
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
understanding that we cannot restrict
 
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
any any person's ability to provide
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
advice or Counseling in the matter of
 
00:49:32.829 --> 00:49:32.839 align:start position:0%
food diet and nutrition but rather
 
00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:35.559 align:start position:0%
establish regulations and standards of
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
qualification training and experience
 
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
for those who are practicing registered
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
dietitians to ensure the safety of the
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
public as chair of the board I recognize
 
00:49:47.549 --> 00:49:47.559 align:start position:0%
the importance and value the board holds
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
in the state in upholding these
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
values the compact is governed by a
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
separate entity however given the
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice model and within
 
00:49:58.589 --> 00:49:58.599 align:start position:0%
the compact language those who reside in
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire as their home
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
state will continue to follow
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate protocols to obtain and
 
00:50:06.789 --> 00:50:06.799 align:start position:0%
maintain lure according to succinct
 
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
guidelines and under our established
 
00:50:11.789 --> 00:50:11.799 align:start position:0%
rsas this ensures that those who reside
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
and are practicing in the state are
 
00:50:15.789 --> 00:50:15.799 align:start position:0%
qualified maintaining required
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
continuing education credits and
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
continue to prioritize serving the

public safely and
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
responsibly aside from the criminal
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
history check that is included within
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire licensing requirements
 
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:30.280 align:start position:0%

compact lienes can choose to hold a
 
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
single state license or obtain a compact
 
00:50:39.309 --> 00:50:39.319 align:start position:0%
license supporting individual
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
autonomy they also have the choice for
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
having the opinion or the option for
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
portability within their
 
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
license within the compact language
 
00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
member states of the compact shall
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
retain sole jurisdiction over the
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
provision of single state licensure
 
00:50:58.990 --> 00:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
currently background checks to obtain
 
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
dietician lure in the state are not
 
00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
required but HB 145 adds the requirement
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
for a criminal history check upon
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
obtaining initial
 
00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
lure this will provide more assurance
 
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
that those residing in the state of New
 
00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are committed to Safe
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
practices with a unified compact
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
commission's data system we will have
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
the information and resources to
 
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
identify those who have compact
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
privileges in the state in all
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions will be made aware if
 
00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
there are any allegations or misconduct
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
specifically relating to investigations
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
or and or complaints of a
 
00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
ly essentially this provides information
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
exchange within compact States so if
 
00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
there's something that can impact
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
somebody's ability to practice states
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
are made aware with the goal to support
 
00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:44.950 align:start position:0%
are made aware with the goal to support
Public

Public
 
00:51:47.549 --> 00:51:47.559 align:start position:0%
Safety the compact language also ensures
 
00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
that lenses exercising a compact
 
00:51:51.549 --> 00:51:51.559 align:start position:0%
privilege shall adhere to the laws and
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
regulations of remote
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
States thank you committee I know we
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
have a lot of really great attendance to
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
be able to testify for this so I'm going
 
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
to leave it at that and welcome to any
 
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
questions I w't take up too much
 
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
additional time thank
 
00:52:08.589 --> 00:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
you representative Pearson thank you
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair um just be before we all
 
00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
start with questions are you well well
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
read on this compact are you the person
 
00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
to ask questions about the
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
compact I am I think there are also some
 
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
others in this room that are very well
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
qualified so I will most definitely do
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
my best to answer the questions if
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
there's any takeaways that I need to get
 
00:52:28.109 --> 00:52:28.119 align:start position:0%
back back to you with I absolutely will
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
have a couple but we'll start with this
 
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
um and I know this seems like we're
 
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
we're running the credits before we're
 
00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
watching the movie um but being familiar
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
with other compacts that the state has
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
entered into what is the procedure to
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
get out of this
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
compact if if this compact ends up not
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
working out for us so I believe there's
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to withdraw from the
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
compact um we would have it would take
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
place I think 180 days from initiation
 
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
withdrawal where is that defined
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
at uh it's in section section 12 of the
 
00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions or represent than
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
you pearon uh the the only other
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
question I have um that's
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
that's bouncing off the top of my head
 
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
you made a mention of state license or
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
compact license that is something that I
 
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
have not heard before when we as far as
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
entering into compacts can you elaborate
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
how that works because it sounds like
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
you're asking for two LIC different
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
types of
 
00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
license yeah so my understanding is that
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
there's two different models of compacts
 
00:54:05.549 --> 00:54:05.559 align:start position:0%
um one is a multi-state model so you get
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
a license in a home state and then you
 
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
can practice in any other compact state
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
so this compact is a privilege to
 
00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
practice model meaning that you have to
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
maintain and obtain a home state lure
 
00:54:19.789 --> 00:54:19.799 align:start position:0%
and then you would have to apply to the
 
00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:21.640 align:start position:0%
governing body to obtain that compact
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
state okay followup then follow please
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
um yeah okay
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
so this would allow you then to have a
 
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire license but not
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
necessarily if you have no desire to
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
work in Vermont or Maine or whatever and
 
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
you just want to work in New
 
00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.549 align:start position:0%
you just want to work in New
Hampshire

00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
then there's you just kind of stop at a
 
00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
certain point and don't have to continue
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
on in order to get a compact license
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
correct you have the autonomy to decide
 
00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
if you want a single state licensure or
 
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
if you want to enter the compact that
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
allows you to practice in multiple
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
States in that case you would apply to
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
that state for their compact license
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's a much easier process there is
 
00:55:05.549 --> 00:55:05.559 align:start position:0%
still a fee involved so there is still
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
that but it's um a much more reduced fee
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
it makes the process much easier and as
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
long as you're maintaining credentials
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
in your home state then you don't have
 
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
to abide by every single State's CU
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
requirements and go above and beyond for
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
all of those other additional
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
requirements it makes the process a lot
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
more simple to give the privilege to
 
00:55:27.029 --> 00:55:27.039 align:start position:0%
practice in other states okay thank you
 
00:55:28.109 --> 00:55:28.119 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome thank you for
 
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
the questionative Le on and then SL uh
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
being here um is the criminal records
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
check something that's being added so
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
that our laws are in line with this
 
00:55:40.589 --> 00:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
compact or is that a separate issue
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and you are
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
correct that is the reason why it is
 
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
added in it aligns with a compact
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
language so it would be required I
 
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
follow it um and um also has this been
 
00:55:53.069 --> 00:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
adopted by other enough other states
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
that it's in force um and if so have
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
there been any changes because I see
 
00:55:59.789 --> 00:55:59.799 align:start position:0%
that if there was anything that needed
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
to be changed every single state who's
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
part of it would need to CH adapt that
 
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
change in their law before it's
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
effective yeah thank you so much for
 
00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
that question um so as of right now four
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
states have legislation enacted we need
 
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
seven in order for it to be an acting
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
compact I believe in the moment we have
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
10 states that's including New Hampshire
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
as well that have legislation pending so
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
to answer your question there's still
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
room to be able to make modific ations
 
00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
because the compact is not quite yet en
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
acting compact but there are four states
 
00:56:33.789 --> 00:56:33.799 align:start position:0%
that have legislation enacted if I can
 
00:56:35.549 --> 00:56:35.559 align:start position:0%
have one more follow follow thank you
 
00:56:37.789 --> 00:56:37.799 align:start position:0%
and um my other question is just around
 
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
the need for the criminal background
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
check my understanding is a lot of the
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
Your Role is in health care settings
 
00:56:46.589 --> 00:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
where you're not in one-on-one
 
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
situations with vulnerable people and
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand why you would
 
00:56:52.589 --> 00:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
need to have a criminal background check
 
00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
in order to do the valuable work you do
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
that is a wonderful question and I I'm
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
going to have to I would have to take
 
00:57:01.789 --> 00:57:01.799 align:start position:0%
that away I don't know the reason and
 
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
the ideology for why that would have
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
been presented within the compact
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
language in particular so without saying
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
specifics I would if you're okay with it
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
take that back and get back to you via
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
email with that appreciate that thank
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
you of course you're
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
welcome representative sitech uh I'm
 
00:57:21.029 --> 00:57:21.039 align:start position:0%
following up on representative lon's uh
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
if I if I Forge checks what's that have
 
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
to do with my ab ability to be a
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
licensed dietician my question really is
 
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
what is the impact what's the
 
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
consequence they do a background check
 
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
and then what what how is
 
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
that uh information
 
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
used the if I may follow a separate
 
00:57:52.349 --> 00:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
question regardless of this reciprocity
 
00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:54.839 align:start position:0%
still exists I could decline I could get
 
00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
a single state license or New Hampshire
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
license and apply for reciprocity to
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts regardless of the compact
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
is that not
 
00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:06.559 align:start position:0%
true correct so to answer the secondary
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
question um you can still apply for
 
00:58:10.349 --> 00:58:10.359 align:start position:0%
reciprocity but when you do you're still
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
going to have to maintain the
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
credentials within that state so it may
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
be easy to get a reciprocal license but
 
00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
then moving forward you're still going
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
to have to maintain all the credentials
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
within that state and that can be really
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
difficult for a lot of people you know
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
um whether it be the cost or you know
 
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
just maintaining the the continuing
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
educations within that state but just
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
from a factual perspective um you are
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
correct they could have a reciprocal
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
license and New Hampshire does honor
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
that and the first question and the
 
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:43.640 align:start position:0%
first question again what what's the
 
00:58:46.349 --> 00:58:46.359 align:start position:0%
impact what what happens after as a
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
result of the criminal background check
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
yeah and that is another question I
 
00:58:52.589 --> 00:58:52.599 align:start position:0%
guess my privity with the background
 
00:58:54.029 --> 00:58:54.039 align:start position:0%
check and the outcomes I would want to
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
take that away my understanding is that
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
states can use that to decide whether
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
they want a a leny to be licensed um but
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know the qualifications in
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
particular for what would differentiate
 
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
okay that's okay and that's not as far
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
as like an ethical perspective so I
 
00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:11.559 align:start position:0%
can't unfortunately I'm not going to
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
speak on that I would want to take that
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
away to get you a more accurate and
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate answer and there may be
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
others that can speak on that um
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
generally for most professions if it's a
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
clean background check the it just sails
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
through if there are any flaws the board
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
has to decide what's what's relevant and
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
what's not thank you I think not having
 
00:59:35.069 --> 00:59:35.079 align:start position:0%
this within ourly since you're currently
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
just makes it a little bit of a barrier
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
for me to speak
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
on okay any other questions all right
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you we will be grilling the next
 
00:59:58.029 --> 00:59:58.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%

of 20 member organizations to kind of
 
01:00:32.109 --> 01:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
speak for what veterans are thinking in
 
01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
the State uh these names should be
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
familiar with you places like
 
01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
organizations like the American Legion
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
the Veterans of Foreign Wars I per I
 
01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
personally represent the Aon space
 
01:00:45.069 --> 01:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
forces Association uh on the committee
 
01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm also their legislative chair
 
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
which means that I go through all of the
 
01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
bills that are being proposed and we
 
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
take we find the ones that have veteran
 
01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
impact we think and we take a position
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
on those bills and then I come and I
 
01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
tell you what those what our position is
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
on that this bill was not on my radar
 
01:01:04.589 --> 01:01:04.599 align:start position:0%
initially and then they pointed out
 
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:07.240 align:start position:0%
section six which is three lines about
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
the uh about military and Military
 
01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839 align:start position:0%
spouses uh being involved in part of
 
01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
this um we like to tell people when I
 
01:01:17.309 --> 01:01:17.319 align:start position:0%
come up and talk to people that in our
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
mind when one of us serves the entire
 
01:01:22.109 --> 01:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
family serves so anything that we can do
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
especially for military spouses to make
 
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
their job easier to make their
 
01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
transition easier as they go from place
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
to place particularly those with
 
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
professional credentials we're all for
 
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
it I also caution folks when I come up
 
01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
and talk to him that that our committee
 
01:01:38.029 --> 01:01:38.039 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
necessarily the experts on all the nuts
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
and bolts of how all of this stuff works
 
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
so what I'm here to tell you today is
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
that we support the concept of military
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
families uh being involved with this
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
where it's a good thing with we support
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
the concept of reciprocity across state
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
lines of professional credential as our
 
01:01:59.269 --> 01:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
families move around the nuts and bolts
 
01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
of how we get there I leave to people
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
who are better qualified than me to
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
answer that so within the other the last
 
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
thing I want to leave you with is if
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
you're planning to introduce a bill that
 
01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
you think has veteran impact we're a
 
01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
resource that you can use we'd be happy
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
to look at the language if it's been
 
01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
tried before and there was a reason why
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
it didn't really gain any traction In
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
The House of the Senate we can tell you
 
01:02:23.309 --> 01:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
that and we can also help you get the
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
language right so that a year down the
 
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
road we don't have to look at
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
potentially an unintended consequence of
 
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
this that we have to go and revise the
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
rsas for it so um with that I I'll
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony if you have any
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
questions for me I'll be happy to answer
 
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
them for the committee the section he's
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
talking about is on page seven lines 30
 
01:02:42.319 --> 01:02:43.150 align:start position:0%
talking about is on page seven lines 30
to

01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
33 and it looks pretty straightforward
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
to me but are there any questions
 
01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.670 align:start position:0%
to me but are there any questions
representive

01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
representive
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chair well as a
 
01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
former member of the Armed Forces myself
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
many years ago uh I know what it's like
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
to serve I also know what it's like to
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
have problems with uh the food that's
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
provided uh because in many cases uh the
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
people doing the doing the stirring and
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
the serving and so forth uh are there
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
for they're they're ordered to to do mes
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
Duty we called it in the Marine Corps uh
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
and and sometimes I think they have um
 
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
had some slip UPS because uh it was not
 
01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
infrequent that we would have problems
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
with the food that led to some issues uh
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
so I I'm in favor of having people who
 
01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
are well qualified but but my question
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
to you is um uh and we've seen this
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
repeatedly in this committee those of us
 
01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:52.839 align:start position:0%
who served for a while uh the fact is
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
veterans get moved around a lot um
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're this Duty station and six
 
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
months later or someplace all the way
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
across the country so the idea of people
 
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
who are have a background the kind of
 
01:04:10.029 --> 01:04:10.039 align:start position:0%
training that we're looking for in New
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um they may be coming in from
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
some other state where they've served
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
and so forth and they qualified and the
 
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
idea of a compact would be to their
 
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
benefit we've we've do done that with a
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
number of profess sessions where we
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
recognize the training service they've
 
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
had in the military when they come to
 
01:04:34.589 --> 01:04:34.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so is this something
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
you're that you're going to look at and
 
01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
and can you speak to that well we're
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
we're certainly in favor of of all of
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
those measures and there's been a few of
 
01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
them in the last few years that have
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
have worked to make this process easier
 
01:04:47.069 --> 01:04:47.079 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we always talk
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
about is is that at some point you're
 
01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
not going to be in the military anymore
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
and then you're going to have to figure
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
out where it is you want to go and if
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
we're a state where it's relatively easy
 
01:04:57.309 --> 01:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
for your your your spouse who is
 
01:04:58.990 --> 01:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
professionally credentialed to get
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
credentialed right off the bat when you
 
01:05:02.589 --> 01:05:02.599 align:start position:0%
get there that might be a consideration
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
when you decide where you're going to
 
01:05:08.109 --> 01:05:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
you and for the committee's information
 
01:05:14.349 --> 01:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
if some if a dietician comes in from
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
another state the only technical
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
qualification for a license by
 
01:05:21.549 --> 01:05:21.559 align:start position:0%
endorsement is to have passed the
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
registered dietician test which I
 
01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
believe is commonly used by almost every
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
state there's no other technical
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
requirement there's of course the form
 
01:05:34.589 --> 01:05:34.599 align:start position:0%
and the fee but that's that's normal
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
representative of the chair are you
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
saying that I don't know that the armed
 
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
services have licensed the dietitians
 
01:05:46.589 --> 01:05:46.599 align:start position:0%
but you're saying in effect I believe
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
that a dietician in good standing
 
01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
leaving the military if they can p if
 
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
that person can pass the test that
 
01:05:55.269 --> 01:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
you've just alluded to that you just
 
01:05:55.279 --> 01:05:56.309 align:start position:0%
you've just alluded to that you just
referenced

01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
referenced
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
they they can be a member of this
 
01:06:02.589 --> 01:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
compact no no I'm saying that currently
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
if a a dietician Moves In from another
 
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
state which state requires passing this
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
test to get the license they're eligible
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
for a license by endorsement after
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
basically filling in the form and
 
01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
sending a
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
check um there's no not very many
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
honorous requirements on getting a New
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license if you have another
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
stes license and the board the the
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
department of military and Veterans
 
01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
Affairs is working with oplc to get the
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
um codes if there are in fact dietitians
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the military what codes would apply
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
toward this lure so it's not yet I I
 
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
don't know the status of it my
 
01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this work has been
 
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
ongoing for a year or so now we had a
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
bill last year to try and take military
 
01:06:59.710 --> 01:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
o uh occupational Specialties and Air
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
Force specialty codes and by code work
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
out what professional licensing uh
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
things they might apply might uh qualify
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
for in the state of New Hampshire and as
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
I understand it that work is still
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
ongoing between DMS and oplc the um the
 
01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
oplc in their uh orientation
 
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
presentation said that they are working
 
01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
on it they've done a couple of boards
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
but they are nowhere they're finished I
 
01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
have no idea if the military employe
 
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
dietitians but it certainly would apply
 
01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.549 align:start position:0%
dietitians but it certainly would apply
to

01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
spouses representative Schmidt thank you

mam chair well this Co colloquy we've
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
been having reminds me of the fact that
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
ordinarily we would see be seeing Warren
 
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
Perry uh in Committee in engaging on
 
01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
these types of subjects but we had one a
 
01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
couple of days ago when he wasn't there
 
01:07:52.349 --> 01:07:52.359 align:start position:0%
and he's not there this morning I'm
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
wondering uh is has he retired or and if
 
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
so who is replacing him yes sir he has
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%

01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair and esteemed
 
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives I just wanted to be

available for any questions so I don't
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
know if there's any questions at oplc
 
01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:07.799 align:start position:0%
can answer for this board I
 
01:09:11.070 --> 01:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
representative broa you is this a tech a
 
01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:20.669 align:start position:0%
representative broa you is this a tech a
procedural

01:09:20.669 --> 01:09:20.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
well no this this compact
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
is is new but we are in a number of
 
01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
other compacts correct that is correct
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
represent of scitech well you're the guy
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
to answer uh what's going on with uh
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
dieticians from the military are they
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
going to be coded in or sure where's the
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
status of that yeah so we have a number
 
01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
of um we're in rule making process so
 
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
the legislature passed as you as you
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
guys well know you passed a statute um
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
that requires uh the rul is to be done I
 
01:09:59.149 --> 01:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
think by 2 it's either 26 or 27 so we're
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
in the process of having we have two
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
part-time rules coordinators as well as
 
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
a full-time one and they're in the
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
process of going to each of the 57
 
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
boards and working with them on putting
 
01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
together rules so I don't know
 
01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
specifically where dieticians is but I
 
01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
can tell you that they are one of those
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
57 boards and they will be
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
addressed okay sometime yes okay thank
 
01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
you that's if we have any specific
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
questions we'll call you back all right
 
01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
Costello good morning my name is
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
Courtney Costello I am a licensed
 
01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
dietitian and owner of a private
 
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
practice here in New Hampshire I'm here
 
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
to express my support for House Bill 145
 
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
which proposes background checks for
 
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
licensed dietitians and adopting the die
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
dietician lure compact um requiring
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
background checks uh for dietitians is
 
01:10:59.070 --> 01:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
vital to protect Public Safety and
 
01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lane you asked a question
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
about why that would be necessary given
 
01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
that dietitians practice in group
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
settings um I just wanted to clarify a
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
lot of times dietitians work in K
 
01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
through 12s um they also work on
 
01:11:13.149 --> 01:11:13.159 align:start position:0%
one-on-one with with patients in um
 
01:11:14.669 --> 01:11:14.679 align:start position:0%
either a private practice setting that
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
could be virtually that could also be in
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
person um so it's not just in group
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
settings it's it can also be one-on-one
 
01:11:21.709 --> 01:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important that we
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
protect the public safety and have safe
 
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
practitioners practicing
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
um The dietitian L lure compact is a
 
01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
Forward Thinking initiative with
 
01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
numerous benefits for our state um the
 
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
compact firstly the compact improves
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
access to care in my practice we have
 
01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
dietitians licensed in at least seven
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
states yet we frequently encounter
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
situations where a patient relocates to
 
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
a state where their dietitian is not
 
01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
licensed this disruption of care can be
 
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
significant in outpatient nutrition
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
counseling building rapport with
 
01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
patients is essential for creating
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
personalized strategies that Inspire
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
meaningful Behavior change
 
01:11:57.629 --> 01:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
addressing the complex challenges of
 
01:11:59.950 --> 01:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
food and nutrition often requ requires a
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
deep understanding of the social and
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
emotional factors influencing a patients
 
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
choices continuity of care is especially
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
important for patients struggling with
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
eating disorders there's a shortage of
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
dietitians who work with this population
 
01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
Nationwide but especially here in New
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire often these patients are
 
01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
students who go to college in another
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
state this disruption of care may not
 
01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
only be inconvenient but it can be
 
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
dangerous establishing trust with a
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
provider takes time and cannot be easily
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
transferred to a new practitioner if
 
01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
you've ever tried to find a new primary
 
01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
care provider you know how disruptive
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
and timeconsuming and frankly
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
frustrating it can be tell health is
 
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
well suited for nutrition counseling our
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
practi is almost exclusively tella
 
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
Health the compact expands teleah Health
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities especially benefiting
 
01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
Rural and unders communities that
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
struggle to Access Nutrition Counseling
 
01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
Services secondly Workforce Mobility as
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned with the military I
 
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
think that's pretty straightforward um
 
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
certain um the military does employ
 
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
dietitians um to do nutrition counseling
 
01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
and various other other things uh lastly
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
economic growth by removing barriers to
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
practice the compact attracts talented
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
professionals to our exceptional State
 
01:13:11.709 --> 01:13:11.719 align:start position:0%
and broadens access to care for granite
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
Staters in my practice we have patients
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
who live outside of New Hampshire for
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
part of the year for example we have
 
01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
patients who live over theboard in
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but summer in New
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um or patients who live in New
 
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then spend the winters
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere down south um um it's not
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
realistic to obtain licenses in other
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
states depending on where the patient
 
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
spends their Summers or Winters
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
currently that revenue is simply lost
 
01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
for that portion of the year and the
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
care is
 
01:13:39.229 --> 01:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
disrupted so in conclusion um House Bill
 
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
145 is a vital piece of legislation that
 
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
enhances Public Safety improves access
 
01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
to care contributes to economic growth
 
01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
and strengthens the dietetics profession
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
by imple implementing background checks
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
and adopting the dietician lure compact
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
our state can lead the way in ensuring
 
01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
high quality accessible nut rtion
 
01:13:57.870 --> 01:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
services for all so I urge you I urge
 
01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
the committee to pass House Bill 145
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for considering my testimony
 
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.629 --> 01:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
scitech are there are there states where
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
dieticians are not licensed
 
01:14:17.629 --> 01:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
yes uh have I follow follow up yes
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
um you have a p you have a client
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
patient who lives you mentioned tella
 
01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
Health yes and I'm want to follow up on
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
that because that's a bumpy road for me
 
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
I don't really have a good feel for it
 
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
your patient moves to Colorado can you
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
continue to uh or to can you continue to
 
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
uh work with that
 
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
patient in another state this is tell I
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
don't know whether your license here
 
01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
permits you to practice in Colorado so
 
01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
we have to be licensed where the patient
 
01:14:53.199 --> 01:14:55.350 align:start position:0%
we have to be licensed where the patient
resides

01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
resides
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
yes the the with tell Health the
 
01:15:01.229 --> 01:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
location in in question is the one where
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
the patient is not where the doctor is
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
so you'd have to get credentials in
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
Colorado which is not likely to be a
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
compact state well in any case you need
 
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
credentials of some sort in Colorado
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
you representative Pierce to jump jump
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
on representative scitec question though
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
in a state that does not have licensing
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
at all no problem there shouldn't be a
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
problem right you would have no
 
01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
prohibition of because if there's no
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
license there's no violation correct
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
right and they would not be eligible to
 
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
enter the compact because they don't
 
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
have a license sure
 
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
schmidth thank you madam chair well I
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
alluded in my earlier questioning of Mr
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Grady to my previous service in the
 
01:15:51.629 --> 01:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
military so I'm very concerned about ma
 
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
situations where where a diean is
 
01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
working or Food Services provided to a
 
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
large number of people such as in a
 
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
hospital we don't we used to have lots
 
01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
of very large corporations frequently
 
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
they would provide food service at the
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
job on the job okay that's less the case
 
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
now than it was previously but hospitals
 
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
for example or other large uh entities
 
01:16:24.189 --> 01:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
that provide food service uh it it's a
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
real problem if you have people who are
 
01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
working with food providing food who are
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
not properly trained because you can do
 
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of damage when you're feeding a
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
lot of people obviously so um do you
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
know you know whether uh your
 
01:16:45.629 --> 01:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
organization uh you know is checking on
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
whether hospitals for example have
 
01:16:50.669 --> 01:16:50.679 align:start position:0%
licensed di
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
ties so in other words the question is
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
are are these entities ensuring that
 
01:16:57.790 --> 01:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
dietitians are licensed that's the
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
underlying issue of course whether the
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
the whether you have somebody working in
 
01:17:07.709 --> 01:17:07.719 align:start position:0%
a in a food service that provides uh
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
that has access to a large C clientele
 
01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
where a a bad egg shall we say uh you
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
know can cause a lot of damage because
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
they're feeding a lot of people I I I
 
01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
frequently eat at the Wentworth Douglas
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
Hospital cafet IA my assumption is that
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
their dietitians are licensed so I'm
 
01:17:32.669 --> 01:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
going to get a better quality of food a
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
better quality of diet and food
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
selection excuse me representative
 
01:17:40.229 --> 01:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
Schmidt the question of whether someone
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
is licensed when they're working in a
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
hospital is a matter of current statute
 
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with this bill okay
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
well I I I that I appreciate that
 
01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
clarification that solves my problem
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you very much much
 
01:17:56.669 --> 01:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
01:17:59.430 --> 01:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
questions all right yes thank you for
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you so much I have
 
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
three people from the New Hampshire
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
Academy of nutrition and dietetics are
 
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
you together or uh separate separate all
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
pyer good morning thank you madam chair
 
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is Kate fifel
 
01:18:30.910 --> 01:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
I am a registered dietician and a
 
01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
licensed dietician I live and work in
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire just for the record I'm
 
01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
here in support of the compact lure you
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
know the dietician compact bill at House
 
01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 145 I ask for your
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
support some of the points I was going
 
01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
to make have already been spoken I just
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to emphasize it is a privilege
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
compact liken to similar to a driver's
 
01:18:58.350 --> 01:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
license um just to clarify if anyone was
 
01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
wondering and we've already touched on
 
01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
the tella health I just wanted to
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
emphasize that preco we were fast
 
01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
approaching the transformation of the
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
delivery of health care which was tella
 
01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
health I was receiving my ma working on
 
01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
my Master's Degree and that was all that
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
was the topic during Co we had to rely
 
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
heavily on it thankfully we had started
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
that Journey postco
 
01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
not only is it convenient I believe
 
01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
consumers have grown to expect it and we
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
need it as previously testim testimony
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
was given about that continuity of care
 
01:19:38.669 --> 01:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
we have to provide that continuity we
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
have a lot of rural communities in New
 
01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's interesting to note
 
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
that about 45 to 50 million Americans
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
live in rural rural communities and they
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
actually represent the highest incidence
 
01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
of some of the top five chronic diseases
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
um and so having access to be able to
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
give the mobility to dietitians
 
01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
especially living on a border state if
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
we can get our neighbors to also be part
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
of the compact allows for that Mobility
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
for the dietician to work with the
 
01:20:14.590 --> 01:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
patients um in the different states and
 
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
also as already mentioned our military
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
and their spouses they are constantly as
 
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
we've already heard
 
01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
relocated um and it just streamlines
 
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
that process for them they have the
 
01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
highest unemployment rate the spouses of
 
01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
military I believe it's
 
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
21% um so this would help um with their
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
concerns as well um one point to make
 
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
and I think this was already said um was
 
01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
that the member state or you know New
 
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would have they would retain
 
01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:47.590 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would have they would retain
sole

01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
sole
 
01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.110 align:start position:0%
sole
jurisdiction

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
um over the provision of all the
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
requirements not the commission of the
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
not the compact commission has some
 
01:20:57.790 --> 01:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
rules but New Hampshire would maintain
 
01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
that sovereignty and to become I think
 
01:21:03.189 --> 01:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
you were asking earlier Madam chair
 
01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
about the requirements to become a
 
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
registered dietician you have to meet a
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
dactic program it is uh a 4-year
 
01:21:12.430 --> 01:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree about a thousand
 
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
practical hours if you are accepted into
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
the it used to be a match program now
 
01:21:19.390 --> 01:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
you're accepted into a program once
 
01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
you've completed that and met the the
 
01:21:25.629 --> 01:21:25.639 align:start position:0%
the requirements you are eligible to sit
 
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
for a national registration exam The
 
01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
Lure further helps when you apply for
 
01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
that license it also helps with the
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
language of a lot of uh reimbursements
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
through Insurance require you to be
 
01:21:40.030 --> 01:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
licensed um and I'm not sure if that was
 
01:21:44.629 --> 01:21:44.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier so I just wanted to
 
01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
again emphasize that we want to protect
 
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
that public health the safety the
 
01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
welfare of our residents and to do so we
 
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
need a little bit more than that
 
01:21:57.229 --> 01:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
reciprocity we want to be able to keep
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
that sole jurisdiction over all the
 
01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
jurist Prudence that is met through our
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements while we work
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
with the other states you have to
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
maintain your home requirements and so
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
to be part of a compact and also be in
 
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire compact you have to
 
01:22:15.629 --> 01:22:15.639 align:start position:0%
meet the Juris Prudence of New Hampshire
 
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
and so I just wanted to make sure that
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
that was clear as well um I'm happy to
 
01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
take any questions that someone might
 
01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
have representative scitech I have two
 
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
questions first uh is you started by
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
saying you're a registered and a
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
licensed what is the distinction why did
 
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
you say that yes so to me become a
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
registered dietitian you have to meet
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
all of the requirements to take the
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
national exam and pass it and then you
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
can then to further protect that and
 
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
protect the public you have to apply for
 
01:22:48.669 --> 01:22:48.679 align:start position:0%
a license in order to practice in the
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
state the second question is there is a
 
01:22:55.229 --> 01:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
national Examination for die
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's what the registration exam is
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
just like a nursing exam it's a national
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
um accredited you have to meet certain
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
requirements it's or that's part of our
 
01:23:09.669 --> 01:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
credential it's our national
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
credential thank you yes represent pear
 
01:23:15.149 --> 01:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
so they're tied together in essence you
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
have to be registered to be licensed
 
01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
correct and the okay and there's no oh
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
gotcha yeah perfect yes and in order to
 
01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
work in a lot of facilities it's a
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
requirement to answer um representative
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
schmidth you to work in a hospital you
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
have to be a registered and licensed
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
dietitian whether you work in food
 
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
service or in clinical care um the other
 
01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
point was that if you're working in a
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
grant funded program you might work in
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
community health and some of these
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
grants are short term and so a lot of
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
dietitians do contract work in addition
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
to private practice and they're moving
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
around from entity to entity um and so
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
those aren't clinical settings but
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
they're shortterm and so they need that
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
mob ability to move around to have the
 
01:23:58.270 --> 01:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
flexibility to work in various locations
 
01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:00.280 align:start position:0%
especially being on a border state it
 
01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
just would make it it it would improve
 
01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
the mobility improve the workforce and
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
also allow for that continuity of the
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
care so thank you representative Leon uh
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um is
 
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts already signed to this
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
compact no they have not they just
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
signed their very first compact which is
 
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
the nursing compact which is not the
 
01:24:21.629 --> 01:24:21.639 align:start position:0%
same as this compact structure um
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts New York and California I
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
believe the only states that really
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
aren't that compact heavy yet um New
 
01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a little bit more than
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
middle we're actually on the higher end
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
um there are 15 other occupational uh
 
01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
compacts and
 
01:24:42.189 --> 01:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
um they are working in Massachusetts and
 
01:24:43.950 --> 01:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
um working on the language some of the
 
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
States you mentioned someone mentioned
 
01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:47.639 align:start position:0%
that that don't have lure uh that's a
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
very limited group and that had to do
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
with their own State Legislature and
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
passing that that legislation and I know
 
01:24:55.149 --> 01:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
they're all working on that in
 
01:24:58.030 --> 01:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts right now uh our Academy
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
is we're working with the language of
 
01:25:02.109 --> 01:25:02.119 align:start position:0%
how their Pathways could be to get to
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
compact that's where they're at right
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
now follow follow up um and I probably
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
should have asked a previous speaker but
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
do you know about Florida um are they
 
01:25:11.109 --> 01:25:11.119 align:start position:0%
already signed because it's been
 
01:25:13.229 --> 01:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned both about people going from M
 
01:25:14.669 --> 01:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire to Massachusetts and
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to Florida so I'm looking
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
to see how relevant this particular
 
01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
compact is for those hire it's the the
 
01:25:25.629 --> 01:25:25.639 align:start position:0%
no the other states are Alabama Nebraska
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
Ohio and Tennessee right and Florida is
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
extremely resistant to not only compacts
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
but other forms of reciprocity okay they
 
01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
don't want people coming in and
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
working uh we do have other dietitians
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
who also um leave the state themselves
 
01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:46.280 align:start position:0%
and I know of one in particular who
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
lives in New Hampshire and she goes to
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
Arizona for three months of the year
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
with her husband's job and she's thought
 
01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
about maybe applying for a license but
 
01:25:58.189 --> 01:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
it's very tedious to follow the you know
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
the education requirements in that um
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
cycle and the New Hampshire license so
 
01:26:06.910 --> 01:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
she has not and she's really hopeful
 
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
that maybe Arizona will adopt that
 
01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
compact where she can easily work in
 
01:26:14.189 --> 01:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
both thank you welcome any other
 
01:26:16.669 --> 01:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.109 --> 01:26:30.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Victor Muzzy I am a
 
01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
captain with the state police that
 
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
oversees the criminal uh Records unit
 
01:26:38.189 --> 01:26:38.199 align:start position:0%
and with that obviously the
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
dissemination of both state criminal
 
01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
conviction and FBI related criminal
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
history um histories so we don't take a
 
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
position on the bill um per se except to
 
01:26:52.510 --> 01:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
make everybody aware that where it
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
includes an FBI um record in this case
 
01:26:58.590 --> 01:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
um this bill should it pass is going to
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
be required to be submitted to the FBI
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
legal unit for review and
 
01:27:06.510 --> 01:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
approval that process unfortunately can
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
take many months in order to to um
 
01:27:13.109 --> 01:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
receive that approval review and
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
approval and it's unfortunately the law
 
01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
unit does not review draft language
 
01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
anymore so we don't even have the
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
ability to kind of proactively submit
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
this to see if it's going to meet their
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
standard relative to the to the
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
dissemination of their record so um I
 
01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
offer you that I see that the the
 
01:27:33.109 --> 01:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
effective date would be 60 days after
 
01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:37.400 align:start position:0%
the passage um should that happen um
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
that's fine except that the state police
 
01:27:41.109 --> 01:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
will not be authorized to disseminate
 
01:27:42.990 --> 01:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
any FBI record until it's been reviewed
 
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
and approved by that that outfit so that
 
01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
certainly would be prohibitive obviously
 
01:27:50.109 --> 01:27:50.119 align:start position:0%
to to the intended result here which is
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
um to provide requisite information for
 
01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
folks making the determination about
 
01:27:56.189 --> 01:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
one's suitability so I offer that
 
01:27:58.510 --> 01:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
information as a as a potential delay to
 
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
be able to execute upon uh the Bill
 
01:28:05.470 --> 01:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
thank you that's valuable information uh
 
01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
as a side note in previous years we've
 
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
had reports of backlogs for criminal
 
01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:12.639 align:start position:0%
record checks is that still the case
 
01:28:14.430 --> 01:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely not n you've cleared it up
 
01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
cleared it up completely cleared been
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
cleared at least a year now excellent
 
01:28:20.189 --> 01:28:20.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much represent citech
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
this went a little fast would you mind
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
walking me through what it what what
 
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
happens when you get a request for a
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:33.550 --> 01:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
happens well I guess that I have to ask
 
01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:36.280 align:start position:0%
you for which part of the process a
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
state record check is typically name and
 
01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
date of birth driven so if we have your
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
name and date of birth we can provide
 
01:28:44.350 --> 01:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
you a record that we may have based upon
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
that name and date of birth if we're
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
talking about an FBI record check uh
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
that comes with a submission of
 
01:28:53.310 --> 01:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
fingerprints and so to say it quite
 
01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:55.400 align:start position:0%
simply the FBI doesn't necessarily care
 
01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
what your name and date of birth is they
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
care what your fingertips look like and
 
01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
that's how they um identify folks within
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
their records and in their system and so
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
really the benefit to that is um you
 
01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
know who you're dealing with it's it's
 
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:12.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to change your fingerprints as
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
everyone's likely aware go ahead uh of
 
01:29:17.229 --> 01:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
the chair follow
 
01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
up what this says criminal background
 
01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
check what's that
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
mean well according to the language that
 
01:29:26.189 --> 01:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
presented here that means a state
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
criminal conviction check and an FBI and
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's a two-part two-part okay correct
 
01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
the FBI part can take months state is
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
fast absolutely not the approval for us
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
to disseminate the FBI record check is
 
01:29:43.229 --> 01:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
going to take months once the approval
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
of this language for us to disseminate
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
their record pursuant to this language
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
has been approved it's going to be as
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
quick as any check is today for an
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
approved authorized statute the the FBI
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any backlog in fact they're
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
required to get back to us within 48
 
01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:00.280 align:start position:0%
Hours of our submission of fingerprints
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
with a result so what takes the months
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
the approval of the language so in other
 
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
words I have to submit this RSA to the
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
FBI legal unit who is going to review
 
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
within the confines of the RSA whether
 
01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:16.189 align:start position:0%
within the confines of the RSA whether
it

01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
meets the standard for dissemination
 
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
under Public Law
 
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
92544 for us to be able to disseminate
 
01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:27.629 align:start position:0%
92544 for us to be able to disseminate
their

01:30:27.629 --> 01:30:27.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:29.950 --> 01:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
record Captain but Captain that's a
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
one-time thing correct okay then after
 
01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:34.719 align:start position:0%
that correct all right correct one time
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
thing that's what I'm saying is this is
 
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
brand new legislation and even if it's
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
even if it weren't it was simply being
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
modified the approval process in order
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
for us to disseminate the record can
 
01:30:46.109 --> 01:30:46.119 align:start position:0%
take months that's the only thing that
 
01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
takes months my
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
apologies and you you also said that
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
they will not look at draft language
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
they'll only look at it after it's been
 
01:30:57.149 --> 01:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor Essen they used
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
to they've discontinued that practice as
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
of about a year ago because they were
 
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
likely getting too many requests so to
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
remedy that situation and we've we've
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
seen a return on a submission in as
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
little as eight months I think and as
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
long as we're still waiting for some and
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
it's been over a year for whatever
 
01:31:13.950 --> 01:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
reason and it might be contingent upon
 
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
the depth of review that is required
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
based upon the submitted the submitted
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
RSA and so what I would suggest to
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat alleviate this um in the future
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
future where it's involving it's fine if
 
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
it's just a state record check right a
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
state record check is our record we can
 
01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
do what we choose with it within State
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
no big deal um the effective date for
 
01:31:35.229 --> 01:31:35.239 align:start position:0%
those types of things that only involve
 
01:31:37.149 --> 01:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
a state check and come much more
 
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
expeditiously when we're talking about
 
01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
an FBI record uh fingerprint supported
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
record check that's where we're at the
 
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
mercy of the FBI legal unit basically um
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
and so my my suggestion or
 
01:31:52.750 --> 01:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be a um as as we've
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
testified for a two or three years now
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
the sooner the state police criminal
 
01:31:59.550 --> 01:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
records unit can get involved in in New
 
01:32:02.669 --> 01:32:02.679 align:start position:0%
Or revised um language that's being put
 
01:32:04.830 --> 01:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
forward in any session the better so
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
that we can help craft that language
 
01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
with the sponsoring folks in order to
 
01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
make sure it'll meet what we believe to
 
01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
be the standard of the law unit
 
01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
additional to that um certainly making
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
the effective date of um those changes a
 
01:32:21.109 --> 01:32:21.119 align:start position:0%
year two years out from when it passes
 
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
would be helpful now I know that's
 
01:32:24.270 --> 01:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
inhibitive in this case because we're
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
talking about a compact and doing other
 
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
things um relative you know that that
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
involve a criminal records check however
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
that that's about the only two
 
01:32:33.390 --> 01:32:33.400 align:start position:0%
suggestions that I can make to help
 
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
alleviate a conundrum that we're going
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
to find ourselves in where this has
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
passed the state is expecting us to be
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
able to do it yet we're at the mercy of
 
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
the FBI who has yet to you review and
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
approve it so thank you uh this bill
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
would if passed besides the compact it
 
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
requires it for a criminal record check
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
for every new
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
license not for existing licenses
 
01:33:03.669 --> 01:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
interestingly but for any new licy and
 
01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
we had how many was
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
it uh like 20 or
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
so new applicants every
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
year uh and there's almost 1200 licensed
 
01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
dietitians so this would put all
 
01:33:28.189 --> 01:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
all of the criminal record checks would
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
be on hold until the FBI finished their
 
01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
um under the authority of the statute
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
yes yep okay thank you and
 
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
um this will be going to subcommittee so
 
01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
if you have any suggestions about the
 
01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
language we would very much appreciate
 
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
them because we'll be we'll be glad to
 
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
work with you to make sure it um doesn't
 
01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
trip up the FBI any more than necessary
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
certainly and I I think we will probably
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
continue to track this so we will likely
 
01:34:02.669 --> 01:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
appear at that that subcommittee meeting
 
01:34:05.669 --> 01:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
if we don't what I can offer um right
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
right in the first instance here is um I
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
don't know I think it's repeated several
 
01:34:15.109 --> 01:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
times um in in the first section here um
 
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
where it refers to the office now
 
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
generally speaking I understand that is
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
likely the office of oplc however that
 
01:34:24.030 --> 01:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
language in in in our recent experience
 
01:34:26.229 --> 01:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
with the uh FBI legal unit might be a
 
01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
little broad they like to see things
 
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
like will be released to the executive
 
01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
director Human Resources administrator
 
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
um a little bit more specific title
 
01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
because the office can imply well is
 
01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
that the janitor in the office is that
 
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
the administrative assistant and things
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
so while I'm not saying that it'll fail
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
for that expressly but U myself and and
 
01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
Christine think about it longer right
 
01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
myself and Christine Shay here um as the
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
CSO on the compact officer for the State
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire are are basically
 
01:34:58.270 --> 01:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
charged with trying to vet these things
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
ahead of sending them to the FBI and our
 
01:35:02.669 --> 01:35:02.679 align:start position:0%
experience has been that many of the uh
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
prior submissions we've had have failed
 
01:35:07.709 --> 01:35:07.719 align:start position:0%
due to being too broad quite frankly
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes we get a slight amount of
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
feedback as to how to make it less broad
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
or why it's too broad but not very often
 
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
do we get some sort of narrowing or
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
focused language so in reading this
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
having the word office there might be a
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
little bit problematic a little bit
 
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
Broad and if if that can be revised in
 
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
some way shape or form to include a
 
01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
specific title of person or persons that
 
01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
would actually be receiving and
 
01:35:31.709 --> 01:35:31.719 align:start position:0%
reviewing the record that that may
 
01:35:34.990 --> 01:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
help it's certainly appropriate because
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
we heard last year that whether it says
 
01:35:40.270 --> 01:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
executive director or office it means
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
the same thing so if the FBI wants to
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
see executive director in this language
 
01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
that seems like a straightforward fix
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
sure you know something more specific
 
01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
than than than office so I apologize
 
01:35:53.709 --> 01:35:53.719 align:start position:0%
representative scitec for my Broad
 
01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
definition and I I will reiterate that
 
01:35:57.790 --> 01:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
what I'm speaking about relative to any
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
delay is simply the approval of this
 
01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
once it's been approved it's business as
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
usual in record checks will'll be flying
 
01:36:05.669 --> 01:36:05.679 align:start position:0%
out the door and off the shelves just as
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
quickly as we can with zero backlog so
 
01:36:10.629 --> 01:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
the only backlog is initially upon
 
01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
approval of it so sorry about that thank
 
01:36:16.109 --> 01:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
you and and I I I would be concerned
 
01:36:18.669 --> 01:36:18.679 align:start position:0%
that would also stop the licensing of
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
any state
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
specific dietitians because of that
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm not aware now if this exists or
 
01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
if this is brand new I I so I don't know
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
that it would affect any other
 
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
pre-existing statute that isn't this one
 
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
so um for what probably not thank you
 
01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
correct all right thank you for the
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
information any questions representative
 
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair so uh you
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
referenced the fact that there was a
 
01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:49.070 align:start position:0%
referenced the fact that there was a
tremendous

01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
tremendous
 
01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
bottleneck this committee is is familiar
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
with the fact that the criminal
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
background check was uh was the one of
 
01:36:59.709 --> 01:36:59.719 align:start position:0%
the major F
 
01:37:02.109 --> 01:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
factors excuse me one of the major
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
factors in that bottleneck and
 
01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
fingerprints were one of the key aspects
 
01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
that was causing problem because um you
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
have to get the the the fingerprinting
 
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
is a is a highly skilled
 
01:37:25.870 --> 01:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh function involved in all of this and
 
01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
if the fingerprint is improperly created
 
01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
by the an
 
01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:33.149 align:start position:0%
by the an
inexpert

01:37:33.149 --> 01:37:33.159 align:start position:0%
inexpert
 
01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes official usually a forign officer
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
I think uh but there are machines that
 
01:37:43.589 --> 01:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
can immediately recognize whether the
 
01:37:46.589 --> 01:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
fingerprint works or not and also it can
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
be immediately submitted submitted
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
electronically and you can get a very
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
fast so are the but there weren't very
 
01:37:57.709 --> 01:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
many of these machines in New Hampshire
 
01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
at the time only about 40 I think are
 
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
there more of them out there now because
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
that it it's like lightning you put your
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
hand on the glass the machine lights up
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
green that the fingerprints are going to
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
be good and bang it gets forward
 
01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
electronically so we we have one in
 
01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
Dover in the police department so I can
 
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
answer that yeah we are I think north of
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
90 machines now 90 90 0 yep and we will
 
01:38:29.229 --> 01:38:29.239 align:start position:0%
I think right now we our maintenance
 
01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
budget will support we think about a
 
01:38:32.830 --> 01:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
hundred without you know increasing that
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
that maintenance budget and so um for
 
01:38:37.390 --> 01:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
the last several years we've we have
 
01:38:39.310 --> 01:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
been successful in being able to Ploy
 
01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
about 10 machines a year we're at the
 
01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
point now where we're going to start
 
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
replacing some of the older end of life
 
01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
machines so we may only purchase five or
 
01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
so new ones um we've been fortunate
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
enough to be able to purchase these
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
machines through through grant funding
 
01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
to buy them the machine it's the
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance that we have to incur the
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
the the additional cost thereof um and
 
01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
just for the record relative to an aphis
 
01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:03.679 align:start position:0%
machine it's called you you are correct
 
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
um you do have to be trained to take
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
fingerprints on an aphis machine that
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
training is is fairly simple I suppose
 
01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
um and and and how to do it it's the
 
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
machine that's smart not that the people
 
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
aren't but it's the machine that's smart
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
and knows um um when a a good print has
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
been established or when there's an
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
issue and things like that so just to
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
just to clear up any misconception I
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
suppose given this opportunity um while
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
the fingerprints are captured on the
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
machine they're not submitted as soon as
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
you hit submit or as soon as you hit
 
01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
save um those fingerprints actually have
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
to be processed by a group of eight
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
people that we have in the office so
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
every fingerprint that's taken in the
 
01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
state whether it's for an applicant um
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
or a criminal which could be an
 
01:39:49.589 --> 01:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
applicant one day is it has to be
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
actually processed by uh the folks on on
 
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
the criminal records unit before it's
 
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
submitted to the FBI that that
 
01:39:59.870 --> 01:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
processing time is minutes I'll say for
 
01:40:01.629 --> 01:40:01.639 align:start position:0%
each of those files if you will or
 
01:40:04.030 --> 01:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
fingerprint submissions but does require
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
human human intervention so I don't want
 
01:40:08.350 --> 01:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
to quote television here or anything
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
like that but it's it's not quite as
 
01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
simple as you put your fingers on the
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
box and a criminal record spits out the
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
back of the machine not that that's what
 
01:40:17.229 --> 01:40:17.239 align:start position:0%
you said sir but just to clarify that
 
01:40:19.229 --> 01:40:19.239 align:start position:0%
there there is a little bit in that
 
01:40:21.629 --> 01:40:21.639 align:start position:0%
process what the aphis machine does
 
01:40:23.589 --> 01:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
though um outside of what we call ink
 
01:40:24.990 --> 01:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
prints which is everyone's probably
 
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
familiar with a fingerprint card with
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
you dip your fingers in ink and you roll
 
01:40:29.470 --> 01:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
them on a fingerprint
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
card the machine obviously does save a
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
few steps um not only in the quality
 
01:40:36.990 --> 01:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
control um aspect of it but obviously
 
01:40:38.669 --> 01:40:38.679 align:start position:0%
the submission of it being electronic
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
because for every ink card that we get
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
in the office and we still do get some
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
we actually have to scan those in to the
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
system whereby obviously the ones we get
 
01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
from the machine are already in in in
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
the system for us to process so it it is
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
a Time save uh saver um we have trained
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
other entities to be able to use these
 
01:40:57.310 --> 01:40:57.320 align:start position:0%
Beyond law enforcement some of the
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
statutes now include language like a
 
01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:02.199 align:start position:0%
qualified law enforcement officer or a
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
qualified uh employee of oplc for
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
example or Department of Education or
 
01:41:08.510 --> 01:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
something like that we've we have
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
trained and sat in on trainings for
 
01:41:12.109 --> 01:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed and other entities to
 
01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
sort of help um enlarge I guess the
 
01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
folks that we have available for us uh
 
01:41:20.350 --> 01:41:20.360 align:start position:0%
to take fingerprints and and capture
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
those things and stuff so we are pretty
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
proud of the infrastru structure that we
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
have at the moment and proud of the
 
01:41:26.910 --> 01:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
progress that we've made in the past
 
01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
couple of years in clearing up the
 
01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
backlog um and quite delighted to
 
01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
illustrate in every again in every
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity because we know things are
 
01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
always delayed right so you folks were
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
under the impression a few minutes ago
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
that a backlog may still exist um but
 
01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
yet it's been a year or better actually
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
really where we have not had any backlog
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
at all um but that message takes some
 
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
time to get out there and so um we're in
 
01:41:48.589 --> 01:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
a pretty good position right now
 
01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
relative to the submission of of
 
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
fingerprints for required background
 
01:41:53.589 --> 01:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
checks and the turnaround time on those
 
01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
and um that that has come at the the
 
01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
diligent hands of the work that's been
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
done by the unit over the past two years
 
01:42:03.310 --> 01:42:03.320 align:start position:0%
so I have a quick follow very much I
 
01:42:05.589 --> 01:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
have a quick quick followup so one of
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
the one of the bottlenecks was SW it had
 
01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
to be a sworn officer are these
 
01:42:13.149 --> 01:42:13.159 align:start position:0%
technicians you were talking about are
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
they considered sworn officers in terms
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
of being able to process no no no the
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
bill in fact mentions that the
 
01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
fingerprints are taken by a qualified
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency or an authorized
 
01:42:30.189 --> 01:42:30.199 align:start position:0%
employee of safety cor is does the oplc
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
have any qualified employees at the
 
01:42:34.510 --> 01:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
moment not to my knowledge but they
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
certainly can if they call us okay well
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
that that might make things easier for
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
other cases thank you very much for
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
Testimony other
 
01:42:46.189 --> 01:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
questions okay
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.629 --> 01:42:57.639 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair and members of
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
the committee um I'd like to say I
 
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time today given to me to
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
speak in support of House Bill 145 I am
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
a licensed registered dietitian and a
 
01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
certified Diabetes Care and education
 
01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
specialist it used to be just diabetes
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
educator but they changed our credential
 
01:43:21.629 --> 01:43:21.639 align:start position:0%
um I currently hold 18 state licenses
 
01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the country
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
um and I live in Deerfield New Hampshire
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
and I worked at Dartmouth and conquered
 
01:43:30.990 --> 01:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
hospital for many years for about 20
 
01:43:34.350 --> 01:43:34.360 align:start position:0%
years I now work for a large company
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
that makes remote patient monitoring
 
01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
devices so we have a blood sugar meter a
 
01:43:41.790 --> 01:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
blood Su a blood pressure cuff and a
 
01:43:45.629 --> 01:43:45.639 align:start position:0%
weight scale for heart failure so I
 
01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
provide um education to my patients
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
across the country um by phone and
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
I cannot talk to them until I'm licensed
 
01:43:58.390 --> 01:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
in that state um or if the state doesn't
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
require a
 
01:44:04.990 --> 01:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
lure um one of my main focus focus is
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
providing maternal health education to
 
01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
um all three Medicaid programs in
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
Georgia so um there are three Medicaid
 
01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
major Medicaid programs in Georgia the
 
01:44:20.709 --> 01:44:20.719 align:start position:0%
state passed a bill to cover maternal
 
01:44:25.109 --> 01:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
Health in these R rural areas so these
 
01:44:27.070 --> 01:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
women can talk to me or one of my
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
colleagues every one to two weeks about
 
01:44:33.589 --> 01:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
nutrition we also have nurses but um
 
01:44:35.550 --> 01:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
again I have to have a state license in
 
01:44:38.470 --> 01:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
Georgia in order to help these
 
01:44:41.550 --> 01:44:41.560 align:start position:0%
women and they have gestational diabetes
 
01:44:44.350 --> 01:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
and high blood pressure and um even
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
pre-existing diabetes during
 
01:44:49.709 --> 01:44:49.719 align:start position:0%
pregnancy uh the majority of my patients
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
do have Medicaid so we work with
 
01:44:56.589 --> 01:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
um I think eight Medicaid programs
 
01:44:58.910 --> 01:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
throughout this the country in different
 
01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:00.430 align:start position:0%
throughout this the country in different
states

01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:45:03.390 --> 01:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
and I've had patients so one example I
 
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
want to share with you is a patient
 
01:45:08.709 --> 01:45:08.719 align:start position:0%
story um a we work with the National
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
Association of letter carriers and so my
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
patient lived in Port Li in New
 
01:45:18.830 --> 01:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
York which is about an hour above UDA
 
01:45:21.310 --> 01:45:21.320 align:start position:0%
New York so there's nothing up there so
 
01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
I was not able to help this person with
 
01:45:27.070 --> 01:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
um cardiovascular and and diabetes
 
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
education until I was licensed and it
 
01:45:31.870 --> 01:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
took 6 months to license me in New
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
York um I've had four background checks
 
01:45:39.070 --> 01:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
in one year for the state of Ohio Nevada
 
01:45:41.189 --> 01:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
Indiana and the state of
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
Washington and I asked if I could share
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
those results and they said no um I'm
 
01:45:49.950 --> 01:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
providing written testimony what I gave
 
01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
you today shows all my licenses and the
 
01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
fees that are associated with those and
 
01:45:57.310 --> 01:45:57.320 align:start position:0%
the due dates to
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
renew all of the the renewal dates are
 
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
very different some go by your birthday
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
some are one year some are two years but
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
basically almost every month of the year
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
I'm renewing a
 
01:46:13.229 --> 01:46:13.239 align:start position:0%
license um so I really hope that you can
 
01:46:16.030 --> 01:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully support this bill um the Rd
 
01:46:18.750 --> 01:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
the registered dietician and the
 
01:46:21.589 --> 01:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
cdce certified Diabetes Care and
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
education specialist CR itial are
 
01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized but we just need a
 
01:46:29.229 --> 01:46:29.239 align:start position:0%
license in each state to in the states
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
that require lure to help our patients
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
um I won't repeat what other people have
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
said but I am open to questions if you
 
01:46:42.109 --> 01:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
have any questions I can take that now
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for your time thank you
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
are there
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
sers thank you madam
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
chair so I again this has to deal with
 
01:46:55.790 --> 01:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
licensing and I'm just trying
 
01:46:58.510 --> 01:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
to I'm I'm on a part that says let's
 
01:47:01.550 --> 01:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
reduce licensing but this is increasing
 
01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
it so do you really see that this is
 
01:47:06.030 --> 01:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
really necessary and as far as if I have
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
tella Health someone's helped me over
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
the phone from another state do they
 
01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
need to get a license here in New
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if we pass this they do they
 
01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:16.189 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if we pass this they do they
do

01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:47:16.199 --> 01:47:19.229 align:start position:0%
do
now

01:47:19.229 --> 01:47:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:19.239 --> 01:47:20.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yes we we
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago we explicitly
 
01:47:29.550 --> 01:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
defined that the case of tella Health if
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
the patients in New Hampshire they
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
require New Hampshire license except in
 
01:47:37.470 --> 01:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
very narrow circumstances follow up I
 
01:47:39.589 --> 01:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
did used to work at the wick program for
 
01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire and we did
 
01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
not require a license so a wick diet a
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
wick can be a nutritionist not a
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
dietician so they can have their
 
01:47:51.550 --> 01:47:51.560 align:start position:0%
four-year bachelor's degree um but as
 
01:47:52.990 --> 01:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
far as I know they may not still still
 
01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
need one but when I worked for Wick I
 
01:47:56.669 --> 01:47:56.679 align:start position:0%
did not need a license but when you go
 
01:47:58.830 --> 01:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
into the healthcare field and deal with
 
01:48:00.589 --> 01:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
insurance reimbursements do you need a
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
license so follow up yeah thank you
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair so again I guess I'm looking
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
at the background check on this is is
 
01:48:11.470 --> 01:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
why is that necessary now were wasn't
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
necessary before I think um in order to
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
draw ATT in order to be attracted by
 
01:48:21.709 --> 01:48:21.719 align:start position:0%
other states other states require the
 
01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
background check and we we never did so
 
01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
I think when they when they created the
 
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
compact uh language they wanted to
 
01:48:32.910 --> 01:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
include some basic things that other
 
01:48:35.229 --> 01:48:35.239 align:start position:0%
states wanted and quite a few of them do
 
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
want background checks and I know it's a
 
01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
for me it's it's a lot of work and
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
annoying because I had four in one year
 
01:48:46.510 --> 01:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
but um I think they made the rules a
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
little bit more um
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
tight than less in hopes that other
 
01:48:54.669 --> 01:48:54.679 align:start position:0%
states that already included the
 
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
background check would would come aboard
 
01:49:00.189 --> 01:49:00.199 align:start position:0%
so Ohio was one of them and they they
 
01:49:01.589 --> 01:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
they would not accept my background
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
check from another state um and so I
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
don't know I think that's why I think
 
01:49:08.830 --> 01:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
they're just trying to check all the
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
boxes and make sure they get all the
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
main points um CDR the commission on
 
01:49:17.470 --> 01:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
dietetic registration is the governing
 
01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
body that oversees our dietitian
 
01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
credential and so um
 
01:49:26.109 --> 01:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
you cannot get to that point unless you
 
01:49:28.109 --> 01:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
have your bachelor's degree your a
 
01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:29.639 align:start position:0%
thousand hours of internship you're
 
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
passing the exam you you maintain 75
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
hours of continuing education every five
 
01:49:38.669 --> 01:49:38.679 align:start position:0%
years so when all these other states ask
 
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
for your undergraduate transcripts your
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know Social Security I had one ask
 
01:49:47.629 --> 01:49:47.639 align:start position:0%
for a social security card a photo um
 
01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
and they ask for my exam scores I I just
 
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
think it's frustrating because if you
 
01:49:56.750 --> 01:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
get to the level of CDR they make sure
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
you have all of those things already
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
there and and they do ask you know have
 
01:50:04.830 --> 01:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
you have you had any felonies you have
 
01:50:06.589 --> 01:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
to check off all these boxes that say
 
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
have you um had anybody sue you and
 
01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
things like that so um but yes so I'm
 
01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
very passionate about this issue so if
 
01:50:17.229 --> 01:50:17.239 align:start position:0%
you have any questions I can you know
 
01:50:17.239 --> 01:50:18.189 align:start position:0%
you have any questions I can you know
hopefully

01:50:18.189 --> 01:50:18.199 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
answer yeah would it be fair to say that
 
01:50:23.709 --> 01:50:23.719 align:start position:0%
the compact is just to solve the
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
problems people have with other states
 
01:50:28.510 --> 01:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
ridiculous requirements I think so um
 
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
one ridiculous example if I have time um
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
my education was too old for New York
 
01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
State I graduated in 1998 I've been a
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
clinical dietitian diabetes educator for
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
20 years and they had to send my
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
application to a separate Council in
 
01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
order to see if I needed to take any
 
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
more undergraduate coursework and I was
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
at at UNH for seven years and um
 
01:51:00.270 --> 01:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
so it kept getting delayed because my
 
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
application had to get approved by a
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
second board so six months for New York
 
01:51:06.750 --> 01:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I that was the longest one
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
and the fees are all different Indiana
 
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
is $20 New York was 294 so I just I feel
 
01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
like this would bring it all together
 
01:51:18.669 --> 01:51:18.679 align:start position:0%
and just make it a lot easier for us to
 
01:51:22.069 --> 01:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
give the patient care that we we need so
 
01:51:24.510 --> 01:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
also working with I work with a lot of
 
01:51:26.910 --> 01:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
dietitians and nurses from Louisiana
 
01:51:31.030 --> 01:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
Texas all over and we gain diversity
 
01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
from learning from our fellow dietitians
 
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
that work in these other states and also
 
01:51:39.069 --> 01:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
from patients so the patients that what
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
they eat in Texas is different than what
 
01:51:42.990 --> 01:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
we might eat up in New England so we're
 
01:51:48.430 --> 01:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
very much um surrounded by diverse um
 
01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
food issues cultural issues too if you
 
01:51:53.629 --> 01:51:53.639 align:start position:0%
could say so okay thank you very much
 
01:51:53.639 --> 01:51:54.550 align:start position:0%
could say so okay thank you very much

questions okay thank you

Innovation I'm here today to speak in
 
01:52:36.030 --> 01:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
strong support of HB 145 the registered
 
01:52:39.149 --> 01:52:39.159 align:start position:0%
dietitian lure compact I have been a
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
tella Health provider since
 
01:52:43.390 --> 01:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
2015 my journey with tella health
 
01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
started when I joined a startup that was
 
01:52:48.109 --> 01:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
aimed at delivering nutrition services
 
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
remotely and our goal was to reach
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
underserved populations where long
 
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
travel times and Associated costs often
 
01:52:57.870 --> 01:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
prevented access to registered
 
01:53:00.109 --> 01:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
dietitians and teleah health allowed us
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
to bring Services directly to those who
 
01:53:05.470 --> 01:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
needed it the most however managing
 
01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
cross state lure was a significant
 
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
challenge as you've already started to
 
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
hear about today lure as you know now is
 
01:53:15.550 --> 01:53:15.560 align:start position:0%
dictated by the state in which the
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
client is located in that means if I
 
01:53:20.669 --> 01:53:20.679 align:start position:0%
support someone who's traveling I must
 
01:53:22.669 --> 01:53:22.679 align:start position:0%
be licensed in every state they pass
 
01:53:25.069 --> 01:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
through during our interactions and I
 
01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
have had that scenario happen before
 
01:53:28.990 --> 01:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
where someone was traveling across the
 
01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
country and it was very challenging to
 
01:53:33.629 --> 01:53:33.639 align:start position:0%
maintain um care for that
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
person cross state lure can also disrupt
 
01:53:39.069 --> 01:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
care for people like college students um
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
those at UNH who work with our oncampus
 
01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
registered dietician but live across the
 
01:53:46.109 --> 01:53:46.119 align:start position:0%
border in Maine or go home to other
 
01:53:49.390 --> 01:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
States during academic breaks at times I
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
held lure in over 10 states each with
 
01:53:53.629 --> 01:53:53.639 align:start position:0%
different require requirements fees and
 
01:53:56.189 --> 01:53:56.199 align:start position:0%
renewal processes for example some
 
01:53:58.030 --> 01:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
states do require fingerprinting which
 
01:54:00.030 --> 01:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
has been referenced already um While
 
01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
others require child abuse training I
 
01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
believe that was Texas um if I'm
 
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
recalling correctly this was complicated
 
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
to navigate timec consuming and costly
 
01:54:12.030 --> 01:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
it also involved complex tracking of
 
01:54:14.430 --> 01:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
continuing education requirements and
 
01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
the fees associated in order to
 
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
unintentionally let a license lapse in
 
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
another role that I held we actually
 
01:54:24.109 --> 01:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't work to our full scope of
 
01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
practice as registered dietitians
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
because the burden of obtaining lure
 
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
across multiple States was too great for
 
01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
the company who I worked for to pursue
 
01:54:37.470 --> 01:54:37.480 align:start position:0%
and maintain as a result our capacity to
 
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
serve clients was highly limited
 
01:54:42.030 --> 01:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
countless times I found myself in
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
conversations with clients equipped with
 
01:54:46.750 --> 01:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
the Knowledge and Skills to help them um
 
01:54:49.030 --> 01:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
but I was actually unable to do so
 
01:54:51.629 --> 01:54:51.639 align:start position:0%
simply because of lure restrictions
 
01:54:54.069 --> 01:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
these were critical missed opportunities
 
01:54:56.189 --> 01:54:56.199 align:start position:0%
and if I'm being frank quite um
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
frustrating moments for myself as a
 
01:55:01.870 --> 01:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
provider HB 145 the registered dietician
 
01:55:04.589 --> 01:55:04.599 align:start position:0%
lure compact addresses these issues by
 
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
allowing dietitians to practice across
 
01:55:09.069 --> 01:55:09.079 align:start position:0%
state lines with a single license this
 
01:55:10.990 --> 01:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
will enhance access to essential
 
01:55:13.149 --> 01:55:13.159 align:start position:0%
nutrition services especially in our
 
01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
underserved in rural areas it will also
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
promote continuity of care allowing
 
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
patients to maintain relationships
 
01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
relationships with their dietician
 
01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
regardless of of State
 
01:55:26.069 --> 01:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
boundaries moreover this compact will
 
01:55:28.589 --> 01:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
reduce administrative burdens and costs
 
01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
enabling dietitians to focus more on
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
client care which is what we want to
 
01:55:35.069 --> 01:55:35.079 align:start position:0%
spend our time doing this efficiency
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
benefits both dietitians and the Health
 
01:55:39.950 --> 01:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
Care System leading to better resource
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
allocation and improved outcomes which
 
01:55:44.950 --> 01:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
is crucial right now in light of the
 
01:55:47.350 --> 01:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
workforce shortages that we are
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
facing many of my students are rising
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
nutrition professionals expressed
 
01:55:55.069 --> 01:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
excitement at my presence here today and
 
01:55:56.830 --> 01:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
not simply because I had to cancel class
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
to be here U but because of the
 
01:56:00.910 --> 01:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
potential this bill has in shaping their
 
01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
future careers and expanding their reach
 
01:56:06.589 --> 01:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
in serving our communities I urge you to
 
01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:09.639 align:start position:0%

committee however I had a very rewarding
 
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
45y year career as a dietitian and
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
diabetes educator hence my personal
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
interest in vigorously supporting this
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
bill um I was Hospital based for the
 
01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
first several years of my career and
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
then was in private practice in New
 
01:57:51.709 --> 01:57:51.719 align:start position:0%
London for 35 years um as has been noted
 
01:57:51.719 --> 01:57:53.270 align:start position:0%
London for 35 years um as has been noted
there

01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
are um situations where people are
 
01:57:58.430 --> 01:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
mobile we're an increasingly mobile
 
01:58:00.830 --> 01:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
Society many of my patients were people
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
with complicated diagnosis such as
 
01:58:05.189 --> 01:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
diabetes and eating disorders these are
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
not conditions that go away we don't
 
01:58:09.069 --> 01:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
have cures for them they need treatment
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
for a lifetime and the treatment needs
 
01:58:13.030 --> 01:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
to be kept up Tod date to fit the
 
01:58:16.109 --> 01:58:16.119 align:start position:0%
patients needs and increasing
 
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge dietitians develop a
 
01:58:21.189 --> 01:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
relationship with their patients as do
 
01:58:23.069 --> 01:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
many healthcare providers providers and
 
01:58:25.350 --> 01:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
it is hard for people to transition to
 
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
other folks so both for Mobility reasons
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
whether it's a snowbird who Winters in
 
01:58:33.629 --> 01:58:33.639 align:start position:0%
the South or a college student or people
 
01:58:35.109 --> 01:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
who work remotely from different parts
 
01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
of the country this would really
 
01:58:40.109 --> 01:58:40.119 align:start position:0%
facilitate continuity of care I would
 
01:58:41.950 --> 01:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
further note in this has not been said
 
01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
when I retired in December of 22 and I
 
01:58:47.310 --> 01:58:47.320 align:start position:0%
had decided to retire and close my
 
01:58:48.990 --> 01:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
practice the winter before and that I
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
would spend that year winding down if
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
you will
 
01:58:56.189 --> 01:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
the hardest part of doing that was that
 
01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
there were not enough people available
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
to refer my patients to and I had
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
already gone from a very busy full-time
 
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
practice to three days a week and I had
 
01:59:10.069 --> 01:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
stopped taking new patients 18 months
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
before I closed my practice and yet for
 
01:59:16.510 --> 01:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
the significant number of remaining
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
patients finding people who were taking
 
01:59:22.350 --> 01:59:22.360 align:start position:0%
new P patients
 
01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:23.350 align:start position:0%
new P patients
who

01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
had serious eating disorder or
 
01:59:28.149 --> 01:59:28.159 align:start position:0%
complicated diabetes situations the
 
01:59:30.069 --> 01:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
weight lists were so
 
01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
long it was very distressful to both me
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
and my patients if we had this compact
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
in place at that time in December 22 it
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
would have been a whole lot easier to
 
01:59:44.229 --> 01:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
line Folks up with providers to give
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
them the continuity of care that they
 
01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
need and
 
01:59:52.669 --> 01:59:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:54.910 --> 01:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
I think the other points that I would
 
01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
make have been said um I would just
 
02:00:00.430 --> 02:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
throw in one other piece when people are
 
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
newly diagnosed with a
 
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
condition that is often the time when
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
they are most
 
02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
receptive to acquiring knowledge and
 
02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
changing behaviors to take good care of
 
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
themselves so if we are telling a person
 
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
say with newly diagnosed diabetes that
 
02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
they can't be seen by a dietitian
 
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
diabetes educator for 3 months
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
we're kind of saying but you'll be okay
 
02:00:26.510 --> 02:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
your condition's not that significant
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
which is not true so again timeliness of
 
02:00:32.430 --> 02:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
care and continuity is very important um
 
02:00:33.870 --> 02:00:33.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the time and effort you
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
all put in happy to answer questions now
 
02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:37.270 align:start position:0%
all put in happy to answer questions now
or

02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
subsequently any questions
 
02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative sers thank you madam
 
02:00:43.310 --> 02:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
chair so your belief in this cont
 
02:00:46.109 --> 02:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
compact will actually ease that case
 
02:00:47.870 --> 02:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
because I've seen it in other practices
 
02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
as well uh I have a grandson that's
 
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
waiting six months to see a uh what is
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
it a dentist that will actually pull a
 
02:00:59.589 --> 02:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
tooth for example so so you think this
 
02:01:01.390 --> 02:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
compact will actually ease that because
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
you'd be able to get people from other
 
02:01:07.149 --> 02:01:07.159 align:start position:0%
states correct um whether via T Health
 
02:01:08.709 --> 02:01:08.719 align:start position:0%
or by the reality that if you're a
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
bordering state and you don't need
 
02:01:13.950 --> 02:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
multiple licenses I didn't reiterate in
 
02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:15.679 align:start position:0%
my testimony but I had a Vermont license
 
02:01:17.790 --> 02:01:17.800 align:start position:0%
as well as a New Hampshire license
 
02:01:19.629 --> 02:01:19.639 align:start position:0%
because living in New London or working
 
02:01:21.669 --> 02:01:21.679 align:start position:0%
in New London I was close enough that I
 
02:01:21.679 --> 02:01:22.470 align:start position:0%
in New London I was close enough that I
had

02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
cross the border um but yes and and I
 
02:01:28.030 --> 02:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
empathize with the dental situation
 
02:01:32.109 --> 02:01:32.119 align:start position:0%
which is an acute problem as
 
02:01:34.069 --> 02:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
well other
 
02:01:36.510 --> 02:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
questions right seeing none thank you
 
02:01:38.950 --> 02:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
very much thank you is there anyone else
 
02:01:42.629 --> 02:01:42.639 align:start position:0%
who wishes to testify on House Bill
 
02:01:46.109 --> 02:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
145 all right they don't see any that
 
02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
case I'm closing the public
 
02:01:52.069 --> 02:01:52.079 align:start position:0%

02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
and the house bill
 
02:01:57.350 --> 02:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
2114 will the PO the hearing will be

03:01:34.309 --> 03:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
this bill um result from the transition
 
03:01:36.510 --> 03:01:36.520 align:start position:0%

03:01:41.150 --> 03:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
Board um I don't know for sure if that
 
03:01:44.269 --> 03:01:44.279 align:start position:0%
was the O the main or the only reason
 
03:01:53.110 --> 03:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:54.830 --> 03:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a question after the
 
03:01:56.630 --> 03:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
testimony in the previous Bill about the
 
03:01:58.269 --> 03:01:58.279 align:start position:0%
background checks did you have a chance
 
03:02:01.550 --> 03:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
to see if this language uh meets what
 
03:02:03.510 --> 03:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
what was suggested on the other bill or
 
03:02:07.630 --> 03:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
if we should out to them it looks to me
 
03:02:10.750 --> 03:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
as though that if it's going to go
 
03:02:13.389 --> 03:02:13.399 align:start position:0%
forward it should have the executive
 
03:02:15.550 --> 03:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
director language inserted in a couple
 
03:02:18.349 --> 03:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
of different places so it it would need
 
03:02:21.309 --> 03:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
to be uh examined if there are other
 
03:02:24.389 --> 03:02:24.399 align:start position:0%
issues I'll uh if there are no other
 
03:02:26.190 --> 03:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
issues I'll work on an amendment
 
03:02:27.550 --> 03:02:27.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise it'll have to go to sub
 
03:02:27.560 --> 03:02:29.030 align:start position:0%
otherwise it'll have to go to sub

03:02:35.870 --> 03:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
chair so again I'm looking at this of
 
03:02:39.110 --> 03:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
course I'm new to Edna so forgive me but
 
03:02:42.590 --> 03:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
I mean background checks I mean why is I
 
03:02:45.870 --> 03:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
I get in some cases are necessary but I
 
03:02:47.910 --> 03:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why we're you you
 
03:02:49.670 --> 03:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
know forcing
 
03:02:52.830 --> 03:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
these that's a very good question it's
 
03:02:56.389 --> 03:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
as I said this was a request and I
 
03:02:58.510 --> 03:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
didn't question whether they need they
 
03:03:01.630 --> 03:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
already had or really needed background
 
03:03:03.510 --> 03:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
checks I kind of think
 
03:03:10.950 --> 03:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:13.229 --> 03:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
unnecessary representative
 
03:03:15.469 --> 03:03:15.479 align:start position:0%
Bailey oh could you turn your microphone
 
03:03:15.479 --> 03:03:16.590 align:start position:0%
Bailey oh could you turn your microphone
on

03:03:16.590 --> 03:03:16.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:03:19.030 --> 03:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
please I I've noticed in the past that
 
03:03:20.910 --> 03:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
there was sometimes a definitional thing
 
03:03:24.670 --> 03:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
up front that's saying OPC is equal to
 
03:03:27.469 --> 03:03:27.479 align:start position:0%
the office and then you can say office
 
03:03:29.349 --> 03:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
is that the solution to the prior one
 
03:03:32.110 --> 03:03:32.120 align:start position:0%
and this one it's
 
03:03:35.070 --> 03:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
um it does say this at some places not
 
03:03:39.630 --> 03:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
in the bill directly but
 
03:03:42.309 --> 03:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
um from the lieutenant I got the
 
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
impression that the FBI was only looking
 
03:03:48.389 --> 03:03:48.399 align:start position:0%
at that specific section
 
03:03:51.229 --> 03:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
so if we wanted to include a specific
 
03:03:54.190 --> 03:03:54.200 align:start position:0%
section talking about FBI background
 
03:03:55.550 --> 03:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
checks we ought to make sure the
 
03:03:59.710 --> 03:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
language is the way they like it thank
 
03:04:02.910 --> 03:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
you other questions from the committee
 
03:04:06.990 --> 03:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:10.670 --> 03:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr Fry would you like to come thank
 
03:04:23.070 --> 03:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:25.389 --> 03:04:25.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon so appreciate you guys
 
03:04:28.469 --> 03:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
having me and um I want to start with
 
03:04:31.349 --> 03:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
his question about background checks so
 
03:04:34.950 --> 03:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
part of the process is trying to um have
 
03:04:36.870 --> 03:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
a universal standard for folks that are
 
03:04:36.880 --> 03:04:37.710 align:start position:0%
a universal standard for folks that are
in

03:04:37.710 --> 03:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:04:41.550 --> 03:04:41.560 align:start position:0%
healthcare everyone nurses doctors or
 
03:04:44.309 --> 03:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
Physicians um are subject to that
 
03:04:47.790 --> 03:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
criminal background check um recre uh
 
03:04:47.800 --> 03:04:49.190 align:start position:0%
criminal background check um recre uh
recreational

03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
recreational
 
03:04:51.590 --> 03:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
therapists um which were previously
 
03:04:53.389 --> 03:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
under Allied Health if you go to the
 
03:04:54.830 --> 03:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
Allied Health statute there's actually a
 
03:04:57.550 --> 03:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
criminal records statute that reflects
 
03:04:59.349 --> 03:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
in that so what we're trying to do with
 
03:05:01.469 --> 03:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
Respiratory Care is to bring them into
 
03:05:04.309 --> 03:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
the same umbrella that the rest of the
 
03:05:08.190 --> 03:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:10.309 --> 03:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
in thank you that's helpful
 
03:05:12.630 --> 03:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson thank
 
03:05:15.030 --> 03:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
you in reference to the discussion we
 
03:05:16.550 --> 03:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
had on the prior Bill and apparently on
 
03:05:18.349 --> 03:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
this bill as well as far as the language
 
03:05:20.790 --> 03:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
of the FBI seems to like for that do we
 
03:05:23.389 --> 03:05:23.399 align:start position:0%
already have one that's been vetted in
 
03:05:26.150 --> 03:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
one of the 57 variety boards that we
 
03:05:27.309 --> 03:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
have do we already have one that the
 
03:05:29.670 --> 03:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
FBI's come back and been okay with that
 
03:05:31.190 --> 03:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
we can just use as a model for the rest
 
03:05:33.950 --> 03:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
of them that is a great question um
 
03:05:34.990 --> 03:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
that's actually the question I was
 
03:05:37.349 --> 03:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
asking the officer or the captain when
 
03:05:39.550 --> 03:05:39.560 align:start position:0%
um after he finished testifying he did
 
03:05:42.030 --> 03:05:42.040 align:start position:0%
give me a statute uh for Department of
 
03:05:44.229 --> 03:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
Education to take a look at so we may be
 
03:05:45.990 --> 03:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
able to borrow some language from that
 
03:05:49.510 --> 03:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
and hopefully just make sure that it's
 
03:05:51.750 --> 03:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
universalized follow up Department of
 
03:05:54.469 --> 03:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
Education is not under oplc yep so
 
03:05:56.110 --> 03:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
that's not going to work I I need
 
03:06:00.110 --> 03:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
something that has has come through the
 
03:06:03.110 --> 03:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
oplc and that way as an agency right
 
03:06:04.750 --> 03:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
because the point of the oplc was to
 
03:06:07.309 --> 03:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
consolidate and make things streamlined
 
03:06:09.389 --> 03:06:09.399 align:start position:0%
and similar and all that right so if we
 
03:06:12.309 --> 03:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
have a standard background check
 
03:06:15.429 --> 03:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
paragraph that we use in these statutes
 
03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
that that have the require IR M of a
 
03:06:20.150 --> 03:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
background check then I think that might
 
03:06:21.910 --> 03:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
make life a lot easier right for the
 
03:06:24.229 --> 03:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
office I I agree and I understand what
 
03:06:26.229 --> 03:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
you're saying but so the point that he
 
03:06:28.030 --> 03:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
was getting at is
 
03:06:30.150 --> 03:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
using instead of using like broad
 
03:06:32.150 --> 03:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
language of office getting into the
 
03:06:33.910 --> 03:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
specific so I'm not saying this is going
 
03:06:36.429 --> 03:06:36.439 align:start position:0%
to be a perfect statute to look at but I
 
03:06:38.269 --> 03:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
think what he was getting at in
 
03:06:41.469 --> 03:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
recommending us to look at that is that
 
03:06:45.510 --> 03:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
that statute uses um executive director
 
03:06:48.990 --> 03:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
for example or I mean or language that
 
03:06:50.870 --> 03:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
would be similar to that right so we
 
03:06:53.429 --> 03:06:53.439 align:start position:0%
want to use moving forward I think what
 
03:06:54.950 --> 03:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
he's saying is we need to use language
 
03:06:56.630 --> 03:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's more specific to folks that are
 
03:06:59.590 --> 03:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
actually or um positions that are in the
 
03:07:01.710 --> 03:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
office so if we can take a look at that
 
03:07:03.670 --> 03:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
statute and see how they've done it
 
03:07:06.150 --> 03:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
right so if they have their their head
 
03:07:07.870 --> 03:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
and their general counsel I don't know
 
03:07:09.150 --> 03:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
because I haven't looked at this statute
 
03:07:11.269 --> 03:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
yet and then try to model hours after
 
03:07:14.110 --> 03:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
that so that we're using similar
 
03:07:16.469 --> 03:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
language that the FBI would have looked
 
03:07:19.070 --> 03:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
at in their
 
03:07:23.670 --> 03:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
statute prob look at the Physicians or
 
03:07:28.229 --> 03:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
nurses or any of the other
 
03:07:31.150 --> 03:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
stat we correct because one of these
 
03:07:32.950 --> 03:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
boards has must have already been
 
03:07:34.990 --> 03:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
approved I I don't disagree with that I
 
03:07:36.670 --> 03:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
think what he's saying is is the the
 
03:07:38.590 --> 03:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
problem is the expediency of it right so
 
03:07:40.269 --> 03:07:40.279 align:start position:0%
if we're using this broad language even
 
03:07:42.670 --> 03:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
if those have been previously approved
 
03:07:45.229 --> 03:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
that may be what the hiccup is so his
 
03:07:46.870 --> 03:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation was if we start using
 
03:07:49.469 --> 03:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:52.670 --> 03:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
titles and to me it would um and if I
 
03:07:55.070 --> 03:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
can ask a question is your understanding
 
03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
that we may have some that previously
 
03:07:59.550 --> 03:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
were approved by the FBI that may not be
 
03:08:00.990 --> 03:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
quite as tied up as they would like
 
03:08:03.030 --> 03:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
today and if we don't have that language
 
03:08:05.349 --> 03:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
in the oplc you want to look to another
 
03:08:07.510 --> 03:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
more recently enacted background check
 
03:08:09.190 --> 03:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
language from any other part of state
 
03:08:11.229 --> 03:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
government that we know was approved by
 
03:08:13.990 --> 03:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
the FDA and this FBI in this program so
 
03:08:15.630 --> 03:08:15.640 align:start position:0%
that we can get as close as we can
 
03:08:17.150 --> 03:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
without perhaps opening up another one
 
03:08:18.870 --> 03:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
and asking them for a review on
 
03:08:20.510 --> 03:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
something that's already functioning
 
03:08:22.790 --> 03:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
correct I think what he's saying or at
 
03:08:24.190 --> 03:08:24.200 align:start position:0%
least as I understood it in speaking
 
03:08:26.309 --> 03:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
with him is that it's not that our
 
03:08:28.070 --> 03:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
statutes aren't getting approved but
 
03:08:30.229 --> 03:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
they're being held up and it seems like
 
03:08:33.590 --> 03:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
this sort of more specific language of
 
03:08:36.110 --> 03:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
what are the positions in the agency
 
03:08:38.070 --> 03:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
that are reviewing these criminal
 
03:08:41.030 --> 03:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
background checks is helping those move
 
03:08:43.830 --> 03:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
forward quicker thank you there
 
03:08:47.510 --> 03:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bailey but in the past
 
03:08:49.710 --> 03:08:49.720 align:start position:0%
they I think they've told us that saying
 
03:08:51.630 --> 03:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
executive director was the same as
 
03:08:54.429 --> 03:08:54.439 align:start position:0%
saying office and but just you put a
 
03:08:57.710 --> 03:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
specific person's name or title in there
 
03:08:59.990 --> 03:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
she's she or he is not looking at every
 
03:09:02.630 --> 03:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
single one somebody in the office is
 
03:09:05.229 --> 03:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
doing that so it's kind isn't this all a
 
03:09:09.150 --> 03:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
distinction without a difference uh so I
 
03:09:10.550 --> 03:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
I believe you've dealt with some of the
 
03:09:12.190 --> 03:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
rules with Department of Health and
 
03:09:14.070 --> 03:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
Human Services and I remember on some of
 
03:09:15.790 --> 03:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
those we have said the commissioner
 
03:09:18.710 --> 03:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
design um and the some of the what we
 
03:09:20.190 --> 03:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
probably would ask you if it's a
 
03:09:23.269 --> 03:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
reasonable ask is to see if or design is
 
03:09:25.429 --> 03:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
something that's been accepted elsewhere
 
03:09:27.950 --> 03:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
y thank
 
03:09:31.429 --> 03:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
you representative sers thank you madam
 
03:09:33.389 --> 03:09:33.399 align:start position:0%
chair I'll be honest what I'm getting
 
03:09:35.070 --> 03:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
hung up with is the criminal background
 
03:09:38.630 --> 03:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
check okay and to me if you need to get
 
03:09:41.750 --> 03:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
relicensed or you know or new you have
 
03:09:44.190 --> 03:09:44.200 align:start position:0%
to have one of these submitted and not
 
03:09:45.830 --> 03:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
and not only that I mean it's one thing
 
03:09:47.389 --> 03:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
having a records check it's a certain
 
03:09:48.990 --> 03:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
another thing having your fingernail uh
 
03:09:52.550 --> 03:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
fingerprints I mean I just think it's
 
03:09:55.070 --> 03:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
over intrusive on government to be
 
03:09:57.590 --> 03:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
forcing this on just because a person
 
03:09:59.910 --> 03:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
needs a license in this
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
case um recreational therapist and so on
 
03:10:06.910 --> 03:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
right so I mean do you really think that
 
03:10:08.910 --> 03:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
these people really need a criminal
 
03:10:11.389 --> 03:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
background check I mean will it will it
 
03:10:13.190 --> 03:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
ever stopped there will be plumbers and
 
03:10:16.190 --> 03:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
Carpenters or electricians next I think
 
03:10:18.150 --> 03:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
the concern in health healthare is just
 
03:10:21.830 --> 03:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
the ability to work with a patient
 
03:10:25.510 --> 03:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
one-on-one so um what the boards are
 
03:10:27.429 --> 03:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
looking for when they see these
 
03:10:30.190 --> 03:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
applications is it's more serious
 
03:10:33.070 --> 03:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
offenses of you know physical assault um
 
03:10:36.950 --> 03:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
sexual assault those sorts of things um
 
03:10:39.070 --> 03:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
so every board that has a criminal
 
03:10:40.750 --> 03:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
record check we're working on putting
 
03:10:43.910 --> 03:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
together what's called a matrix so that
 
03:10:47.790 --> 03:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
if someone has a minor conviction um
 
03:10:49.229 --> 03:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
that's never going to make it to the
 
03:10:51.830 --> 03:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
board's desk those people get licensed
 
03:10:55.790 --> 03:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:00.630 --> 03:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
up follow up thank you so if I had
 
03:11:04.710 --> 03:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
a criminal background and uh because of
 
03:11:07.349 --> 03:11:07.359 align:start position:0%
theft or whatever and it was whatever is
 
03:11:08.510 --> 03:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
I put I went to jail and they had my
 
03:11:10.870 --> 03:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
fingerprints and all that what I
 
03:11:11.910 --> 03:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't be able to get a
 
03:11:14.550 --> 03:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
license I mean to me it's just
 
03:11:15.910 --> 03:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
governments we're just putting we're
 
03:11:17.590 --> 03:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
becoming a nanny State I mean doesn't
 
03:11:19.269 --> 03:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
make sense what we need this criminal
 
03:11:20.910 --> 03:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
background I'm okay with everything else
 
03:11:23.349 --> 03:11:23.359 align:start position:0%
but the criminal background is there any
 
03:11:25.710 --> 03:11:25.720 align:start position:0%
way that you feel comfortable without
 
03:11:27.469 --> 03:11:27.479 align:start position:0%
that part in
 
03:11:30.590 --> 03:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
there so I I want to clarify a little
 
03:11:32.830 --> 03:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
bit so the process that the legislature
 
03:11:34.670 --> 03:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
has put in place for a review of a
 
03:11:37.349 --> 03:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
criminal record check and whether it um
 
03:11:40.389 --> 03:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
disqualifies you from becoming a lensey
 
03:11:44.590 --> 03:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
under a board is RSA 332 gon 10 that
 
03:11:46.870 --> 03:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
sets up a burden of proof of clearing
 
03:11:49.670 --> 03:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
convin ing evidence that's on the state
 
03:11:53.710 --> 03:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
so it's a very very high standard for um
 
03:11:56.150 --> 03:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
I I I should probably preface with this
 
03:11:57.590 --> 03:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
I've been the hearings examiner before I
 
03:11:59.030 --> 03:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
took over this position of general
 
03:12:00.870 --> 03:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
counsel um with the office of
 
03:12:02.710 --> 03:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
professional licenser and certification
 
03:12:05.790 --> 03:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
for since October of 2021 I've done a
 
03:12:08.229 --> 03:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
lot of these hearings there are very few
 
03:12:10.349 --> 03:12:10.359 align:start position:0%
very very few where someone walks away
 
03:12:14.590 --> 03:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
without a license and um of those
 
03:12:16.830 --> 03:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
hearings right the majority of people
 
03:12:18.950 --> 03:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
that are applying or not even going to a
 
03:12:22.429 --> 03:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
hearing so um the legislature I think
 
03:12:25.910 --> 03:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
has set up a fair
 
03:12:29.269 --> 03:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
statute um that protects the
 
03:12:31.510 --> 03:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
public but also ensures that we're
 
03:12:35.910 --> 03:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:37.670 --> 03:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
licensed one more followup
 
03:12:39.790 --> 03:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I I was just
 
03:12:41.510 --> 03:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
going to say so has the public come to
 
03:12:44.190 --> 03:12:44.200 align:start position:0%
you saying we need criminal background
 
03:12:46.630 --> 03:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
checks on these licensers because they
 
03:12:46.640 --> 03:12:48.590 align:start position:0%
checks on these licensers because they
feel

03:12:48.590 --> 03:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
feel
 
03:12:50.870 --> 03:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
safe I've only been in this position for
 
03:12:53.070 --> 03:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
a few months so I can't answer that that
 
03:12:55.190 --> 03:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
question really well but in my few
 
03:12:56.590 --> 03:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
months that I've been here no would be
 
03:13:00.229 --> 03:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
the answer yep y um representative um
 
03:13:01.790 --> 03:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
one of the areas is people assume
 
03:13:03.309 --> 03:13:03.319 align:start position:0%
certain people are background checked
 
03:13:04.950 --> 03:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
like people assume Library volunteers
 
03:13:07.389 --> 03:13:07.399 align:start position:0%
are even though they aren't um so it's
 
03:13:08.870 --> 03:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
just a matter of standardization so
 
03:13:09.870 --> 03:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
that's something that I think we can
 
03:13:13.309 --> 03:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
discuss as a committee as well later on
 
03:13:15.790 --> 03:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
representative de Madam sherff thank you
 
03:13:17.630 --> 03:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
um would it be fair fair to say that
 
03:13:20.269 --> 03:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
under this Matrix somebody who was um
 
03:13:23.750 --> 03:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
convicted of a sexual assault then would
 
03:13:25.550 --> 03:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
probably not meet the licensing
 
03:13:27.510 --> 03:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
requirements and therefore not have
 
03:13:28.990 --> 03:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
access to one-on-one patient care
 
03:13:31.429 --> 03:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
including with minors this is that
 
03:13:33.190 --> 03:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
something that this that would be
 
03:13:34.950 --> 03:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
checked that the criminal background
 
03:13:37.790 --> 03:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
check would would address right so the
 
03:13:40.389 --> 03:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
the background check would address that
 
03:13:42.070 --> 03:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to be clear
 
03:13:45.510 --> 03:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
too internally we are not denying people
 
03:13:46.830 --> 03:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
just because they have a conviction they
 
03:13:49.190 --> 03:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
get hearing I get a hearing under RSA
 
03:13:51.990 --> 03:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
332 G and 10 with that same burden of
 
03:13:53.429 --> 03:13:53.439 align:start position:0%
proof that I was talking about that is
 
03:13:54.830 --> 03:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
placed on the
 
03:13:58.510 --> 03:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
state followup thank you um so it would
 
03:14:00.429 --> 03:14:00.439 align:start position:0%
trigger if you found something like that
 
03:14:02.110 --> 03:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
on a criminal background check it would
 
03:14:04.349 --> 03:14:04.359 align:start position:0%
then trigger hearing yes correct thank
 
03:14:06.550 --> 03:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
03:14:09.389 --> 03:14:09.399 align:start position:0%
yep um and I will ask a question on this
 
03:14:11.630 --> 03:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
as well I know in some other areas we
 
03:14:13.870 --> 03:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
have um especially in teacher licensing
 
03:14:16.229 --> 03:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
we spell out specifically which
 
03:14:18.630 --> 03:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
convictions are qualifying uh my
 
03:14:21.229 --> 03:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
question would be if um it's just more
 
03:14:23.670 --> 03:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
of an issue where where right now the
 
03:14:25.269 --> 03:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
hearings officers are working through
 
03:14:26.469 --> 03:14:26.479 align:start position:0%
and they have a good way of
 
03:14:27.710 --> 03:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
understanding the difference between a
 
03:14:29.269 --> 03:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
decent exposure because somebody thought
 
03:14:31.070 --> 03:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
a Bush was in the way when they couldn't
 
03:14:32.990 --> 03:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
make it inside versus an indecent
 
03:14:35.710 --> 03:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
exposure that is far more indecent and
 
03:14:37.870 --> 03:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
is it some of that discretion on the
 
03:14:39.750 --> 03:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
part of the hearing officers to
 
03:14:41.229 --> 03:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
understand the true nature of the
 
03:14:44.429 --> 03:14:44.439 align:start position:0%
conviction so yeah so the board is the
 
03:14:46.429 --> 03:14:46.439 align:start position:0%
FactFinder it's similar to how our
 
03:14:48.150 --> 03:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearings works so the board
 
03:14:50.429 --> 03:14:50.439 align:start position:0%
is the FactFinder uh the presiding
 
03:14:52.910 --> 03:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
officer the hearings examiner is the
 
03:14:56.070 --> 03:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
basically makes the legal decisions so
 
03:14:58.150 --> 03:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
um the hearings are set up to hear the
 
03:15:00.469 --> 03:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
facts of the case the specific facts of
 
03:15:03.269 --> 03:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
the case to determine whether um the
 
03:15:04.590 --> 03:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
conviction is such that it should
 
03:15:06.870 --> 03:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
disqualify the person for public
 
03:15:06.880 --> 03:15:08.590 align:start position:0%
disqualify the person for public
protection

03:15:08.590 --> 03:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
protection
 
03:15:11.590 --> 03:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
reasons thank you any other questions
 
03:15:13.950 --> 03:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
from the committee saying none thank you
 
03:15:17.990 --> 03:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
very much okay thank you very much
 
03:15:19.990 --> 03:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else here to speak on
 
03:15:21.590 --> 03:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:15:23.990 --> 03:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
214 seeing none I will close this
 
03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:26.110 align:start position:0%
214 seeing none I will close this
hearing

03:15:26.110 --> 03:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:15:54.990 --> 03:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:57.510 --> 03:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
all right I'll open the hearing on House
 
03:16:03.630 --> 03:16:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:06.990 --> 03:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
land thank you madam chair House Bill
 
03:16:09.630 --> 03:16:09.640 align:start position:0%
227 is one of those bills that I think
 
03:16:11.510 --> 03:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
should be pretty simple however that's
 
03:16:13.150 --> 03:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
why we're having a hearing and having a
 
03:16:16.269 --> 03:16:16.279 align:start position:0%
chance to discuss it right now there are
 
03:16:18.590 --> 03:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
two different school psychologist uh
 
03:16:20.830 --> 03:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy licenses and the
 
03:16:23.269 --> 03:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is also enabled
 
03:16:25.590 --> 03:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
to create other licensing for
 
03:16:29.550 --> 03:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy in the schools uh to me
 
03:16:31.910 --> 03:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's that would seem to relieve any need
 
03:16:33.309 --> 03:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
that they would have for licensing
 
03:16:35.469 --> 03:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
within the schools so you would not need
 
03:16:38.229 --> 03:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
an exemption for anybody who is employed
 
03:16:40.349 --> 03:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
by a state County Municipal agency or
 
03:16:42.870 --> 03:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
other political subdivision or a duly
 
03:16:45.150 --> 03:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
chartered educational
 
03:16:47.790 --> 03:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
institution so the the idea of having
 
03:16:50.830 --> 03:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
people who are not licensed to practice
 
03:16:53.269 --> 03:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy permitted to do so without
 
03:16:54.910 --> 03:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
a license in our schools is quite
 
03:16:56.870 --> 03:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
troubling uh we have many we have
 
03:16:58.710 --> 03:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
resources in our schools perhaps not as
 
03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
many as we would like but when you're
 
03:17:02.309 --> 03:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
speaking about a vulnerable child it's
 
03:17:04.269 --> 03:17:04.279 align:start position:0%
even more important to make sure that
 
03:17:05.790 --> 03:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
there are appropriate standards for
 
03:17:08.590 --> 03:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
those who are offering these Services um
 
03:17:10.150 --> 03:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
I also want to note that there is
 
03:17:12.389 --> 03:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
another exemption for the Psychotherapy
 
03:17:14.110 --> 03:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
licensing and that's when you're working
 
03:17:16.910 --> 03:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
for some sort of company or nonprofit
 
03:17:19.229 --> 03:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
that takes on the financial ethical or
 
03:17:21.469 --> 03:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
moral responsibility for you because you
 
03:17:22.590 --> 03:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
are not
 
03:17:25.630 --> 03:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
licensed there is only the broad
 
03:17:27.269 --> 03:17:27.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility of that of local
 
03:17:28.590 --> 03:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
government or the educational
 
03:17:31.630 --> 03:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
institution because ultimately if the
 
03:17:34.670 --> 03:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
government does somebody wrong uh we the
 
03:17:38.309 --> 03:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are on the hook for that
 
03:17:41.309 --> 03:17:41.319 align:start position:0%
problem allowing private in institutions
 
03:17:43.429 --> 03:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
to take that responsibility allows them
 
03:17:45.590 --> 03:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
to take that risk however state
 
03:17:47.910 --> 03:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
government already has a fantastic way
 
03:17:49.590 --> 03:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
to ensure that only those people with
 
03:17:51.790 --> 03:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate training and knowledge can
 
03:17:53.950 --> 03:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
participate in licensed activities like
 
03:17:56.630 --> 03:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy and so wavering waving
 
03:18:00.830 --> 03:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
that without um such waving that just
 
03:18:03.309 --> 03:18:03.319 align:start position:0%
seems to be a bit too far we already
 
03:18:05.229 --> 03:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
have our processes we already have our
 
03:18:07.630 --> 03:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
standards and I believe that it is in
 
03:18:09.670 --> 03:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
the Public's interest to remove this
 
03:18:12.269 --> 03:18:12.279 align:start position:0%
exemption to licensing so we can ensure
 
03:18:14.229 --> 03:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
that everybody who's practicing
 
03:18:17.590 --> 03:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy um is is doing so with
 
03:18:19.870 --> 03:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate care with that I'm happy to
 
03:18:19.880 --> 03:18:21.389 align:start position:0%
appropriate care with that I'm happy to
take

03:18:21.389 --> 03:18:21.399 align:start position:0%
take
 
03:18:24.469 --> 03:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:18:27.630 --> 03:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
Roa thank you representative Leon so on
 
03:18:31.830 --> 03:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
the um on the exception from did you say
 
03:18:35.070 --> 03:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Education had
 
03:18:37.710 --> 03:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
standards and could issue a license for
 
03:18:39.510 --> 03:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
a school psychotherapist or did I
 
03:18:41.710 --> 03:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
misunderstand what you were saying um
 
03:18:43.389 --> 03:18:43.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question there are two
 
03:18:44.950 --> 03:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
different classifications of school
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
psych psychotherapists and r a 329b 329b
 
03:18:51.750 --> 03:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
also gives the Department of Education
 
03:18:53.269 --> 03:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
the ability to create another
 
03:18:57.070 --> 03:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
necessary followup follow up and this
 
03:19:03.910 --> 03:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
bill eliminates that option no this bill
 
03:19:06.030 --> 03:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
does not touch that department of op of
 
03:19:09.189 --> 03:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
Education process for additional lure um
 
03:19:11.590 --> 03:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it removes a full
 
03:19:14.189 --> 03:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
and complete um exemption from licensing
 
03:19:16.309 --> 03:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
for Psychotherapy Services at these
 
03:19:17.630 --> 03:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
instit institions
 
03:19:21.189 --> 03:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
so um what this means is most of what
 
03:19:22.990 --> 03:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
people are held to for Psychotherapy is
 
03:19:25.550 --> 03:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
done through the licensing if you look
 
03:19:28.590 --> 03:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
um the conversion therapy ban is fully
 
03:19:31.429 --> 03:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
en enforced through licensing statutes
 
03:19:33.550 --> 03:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
so if you're not licensed there's
 
03:19:34.990 --> 03:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
nothing that stops you from doing
 
03:19:38.590 --> 03:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
potentially horrible things to people um
 
03:19:40.950 --> 03:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
with with this you could have a teacher
 
03:19:42.790 --> 03:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
who's not licensed for
 
03:19:44.950 --> 03:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy doing things that we have
 
03:19:47.229 --> 03:19:47.239 align:start position:0%
deemed completely inappropriate with no
 
03:19:50.030 --> 03:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
real way of addressing that because
 
03:19:52.670 --> 03:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
that's not anywhere in the teachers um
 
03:19:53.990 --> 03:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
in the teacher's contract or the
 
03:19:56.389 --> 03:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
teachers's requirements because normally
 
03:19:58.189 --> 03:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
that type of thing which should never
 
03:20:00.590 --> 03:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
happen would happen in in a in something
 
03:20:05.309 --> 03:20:05.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:08.150 --> 03:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy representative Pearson um
 
03:20:10.030 --> 03:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
I have a I have a question for you
 
03:20:12.670 --> 03:20:12.680 align:start position:0%
considering the nature in which the
 
03:20:14.910 --> 03:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
topic of this
 
03:20:17.590 --> 03:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
covers other committees that we have in
 
03:20:19.309 --> 03:20:19.319 align:start position:0%
the house is this a two Bill committee
 
03:20:21.030 --> 03:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
or a two bill or a two committee Bill
 
03:20:23.229 --> 03:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
rather let me look it up and get back to
 
03:20:25.950 --> 03:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
you on it I think not it was not when I
 
03:20:28.590 --> 03:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
reviewed it earlier okay thank you sure
 
03:20:30.910 --> 03:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
all right probably not
 
03:20:34.870 --> 03:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
I second one uh I'm just I'm kind of
 
03:20:36.990 --> 03:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
like dealing with a little bit of
 
03:20:38.710 --> 03:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
internal shock right now that we're even
 
03:20:43.110 --> 03:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
having to that this even exists um wow
 
03:20:50.710 --> 03:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:50.720 --> 03:20:53.110 align:start position:0%
 
looking

03:20:53.110 --> 03:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
looking
 
03:20:56.269 --> 03:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
at State County Municipal agency or
 
03:20:59.150 --> 03:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
other political subdivision or or duly
 
03:21:01.990 --> 03:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
chartered educational
 
03:21:05.309 --> 03:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
institution can you help me out on what
 
03:21:08.750 --> 03:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
duly chartered educational institution
 
03:21:11.349 --> 03:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
covers thank you that's a great question
 
03:21:13.950 --> 03:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
and is one of the problems of having our
 
03:21:16.710 --> 03:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
laws be built upon each other as as
 
03:21:18.309 --> 03:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to going and looking more
 
03:21:19.750 --> 03:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
holistically about everything that's
 
03:21:21.309 --> 03:21:21.319 align:start position:0%
impacted by each of these bills that we
 
03:21:23.150 --> 03:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
deal with when I was looking and trying
 
03:21:24.790 --> 03:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
to trace through the breadcrumbs of all
 
03:21:28.030 --> 03:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
the changes to the statute um I I I
 
03:21:30.070 --> 03:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
don't know how many years I went back
 
03:21:32.070 --> 03:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
trying to find when this was actually
 
03:21:34.870 --> 03:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
inserted in the law but it's old and
 
03:21:36.990 --> 03:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
many many many parts of our protective
 
03:21:39.429 --> 03:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
statutes for Psychotherapy have changed
 
03:21:41.670 --> 03:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
and been added to and created since the
 
03:21:43.630 --> 03:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
time that this exemption was put in
 
03:21:45.950 --> 03:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
place I think at one time it served a
 
03:21:48.550 --> 03:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
purpose but I think at this point it is
 
03:21:51.150 --> 03:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
old and Antiquated and uh should be put
 
03:21:55.349 --> 03:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:55.359 --> 03:21:57.269 align:start position:0%
 
pasture

03:21:57.269 --> 03:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
pasture
 
03:22:00.389 --> 03:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
okay other
 
03:22:03.389 --> 03:22:03.399 align:start position:0%
questions representative sellers thank
 
03:22:05.550 --> 03:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
you madam chair so on that note as well
 
03:22:08.189 --> 03:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
is I'm I'm just making sure this is not
 
03:22:08.199 --> 03:22:09.429 align:start position:0%
is I'm I'm just making sure this is not
going

03:22:09.429 --> 03:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
going
 
03:22:13.990 --> 03:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:16.150 --> 03:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
schools um thank you for that question
 
03:22:18.510 --> 03:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it says duly chartered
 
03:22:21.309 --> 03:22:21.319 align:start position:0%
educational institution um I would have
 
03:22:22.510 --> 03:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
a hard
 
03:22:25.750 --> 03:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
time if if this the only way that this
 
03:22:27.550 --> 03:22:27.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't impact the private schools
 
03:22:29.150 --> 03:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
would be if they weren't allowed to have
 
03:22:30.710 --> 03:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
unlicensed people practicing
 
03:22:34.950 --> 03:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy today if um if a private
 
03:22:37.469 --> 03:22:37.479 align:start position:0%
school is included in this then it would
 
03:22:39.030 --> 03:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
separate them from this and mean that
 
03:22:40.990 --> 03:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
they need to be licensed um if they're
 
03:22:42.469 --> 03:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
not then they can't do that anyways
 
03:22:45.150 --> 03:22:45.160 align:start position:0%
there is a separate um exemption for
 
03:22:49.150 --> 03:22:49.160 align:start position:0%
clergy and for other groups where
 
03:22:51.469 --> 03:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
where there there's other exemptions I'm
 
03:22:53.269 --> 03:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
not removing all the exemptions from the
 
03:22:56.349 --> 03:22:56.359 align:start position:0%
law um but what I'm focusing on is State
 
03:22:57.790 --> 03:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
County municipal or political
 
03:22:59.189 --> 03:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
subdivisions or the educational
 
03:23:01.590 --> 03:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
institutions because I think our law is
 
03:23:03.750 --> 03:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
evolved to become a lot richer and this
 
03:23:03.760 --> 03:23:07.309 align:start position:0%
evolved to become a lot richer and this
is

03:23:07.309 --> 03:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:10.790 --> 03:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
Antiquated yeah it depends on whether a
 
03:23:13.110 --> 03:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
private school falls under a uh
 
03:23:16.750 --> 03:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
chartered educational Institution
 
03:23:20.110 --> 03:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
yes follow follow up thank you mam chair
 
03:23:22.150 --> 03:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm getting hung up with these
 
03:23:25.790 --> 03:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
three words ched education institutions
 
03:23:27.830 --> 03:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
does that cover our Public
 
03:23:30.550 --> 03:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
Schools I'm just I I
 
03:23:33.070 --> 03:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
just yeah that's my my understanding is
 
03:23:35.030 --> 03:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
that that would cover our private our
 
03:23:37.630 --> 03:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
public schools because they are they're
 
03:23:39.990 --> 03:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
also a political subdivision because our
 
03:23:41.269 --> 03:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
school districts are political
 
03:23:41.279 --> 03:23:47.870 align:start position:0%
school districts are political
subdivisions

03:23:47.870 --> 03:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:51.990 --> 03:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:54.429 --> 03:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
Schmid is just going to go to a
 
03:23:56.349 --> 03:23:56.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee well I was hoping it
 
03:23:58.910 --> 03:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be necessary well the thing is
 
03:24:02.070 --> 03:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
because we have the sponsor do we have
 
03:24:04.110 --> 03:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
any other pink cards of people who are
 
03:24:06.349 --> 03:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
going to speak to us about this issue
 
03:24:06.359 --> 03:24:07.189 align:start position:0%
going to speak to us about this issue
there

03:24:07.189 --> 03:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:24:07.199 --> 03:24:08.870 align:start position:0%
there
is

03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:24:13.429 --> 03:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Fry from the oplc is available for
 
03:24:16.189 --> 03:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
questions because I think this is kind
 
03:24:20.229 --> 03:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
of a drop dead Bill uh and uh so to the
 
03:24:23.710 --> 03:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
degree that we don't have any uh
 
03:24:27.870 --> 03:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
any anyone who's in practitioner of
 
03:24:31.790 --> 03:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
these activities uh or oversees them or
 
03:24:34.670 --> 03:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
whatever I think we're standing on the
 
03:24:36.870 --> 03:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
diving board in the night wondering
 
03:24:38.630 --> 03:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
whether there's any water in the pool
 
03:24:40.030 --> 03:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
before we dive
 
03:24:43.550 --> 03:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
off may I answer that question please um
 
03:24:45.309 --> 03:24:45.319 align:start position:0%
we're actually speaking about people who
 
03:24:47.910 --> 03:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
are not overseeing by anybody there is
 
03:24:50.110 --> 03:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely no oversight of people who
 
03:24:52.590 --> 03:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
are Exempted from the licensing statutes
 
03:24:54.389 --> 03:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
so you have people who legally are
 
03:24:56.030 --> 03:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to practice medicine without a
 
03:24:58.349 --> 03:24:58.359 align:start position:0%
license and this is removing that
 
03:25:00.750 --> 03:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
exemption so that they would have to be
 
03:25:04.150 --> 03:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
overseen I I I understand the the
 
03:25:06.990 --> 03:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
premise of the bill uh but I just would
 
03:25:10.870 --> 03:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
like to have a a little bit more of a he
 
03:25:15.510 --> 03:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
said she said uh treatment of the matter
 
03:25:18.309 --> 03:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
I I I understand that it's like a trapo
 
03:25:24.070 --> 03:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
you don't see um but I abide by whatever
 
03:25:30.710 --> 03:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:33.630 --> 03:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
thinks apparently the psych
 
03:25:35.550 --> 03:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
psychological committee or the
 
03:25:38.429 --> 03:25:38.439 align:start position:0%
psychologist Comm Community didn't think
 
03:25:42.269 --> 03:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
this was important enough to to register
 
03:25:44.950 --> 03:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
because we've dealt with them before and
 
03:25:48.309 --> 03:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
they are very they feel no no difficulty
 
03:25:50.189 --> 03:25:50.199 align:start position:0%
in jumping in and letting us know if
 
03:25:51.670 --> 03:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
there is an
 
03:25:54.710 --> 03:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
issue and Madam chair they are aware of
 
03:25:56.550 --> 03:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
this bill because they spoke to me about
 
03:25:58.510 --> 03:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
it and they said that they had no
 
03:26:00.990 --> 03:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
problem with that because they the I'm
 
03:26:02.269 --> 03:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
not saying that this is an official
 
03:26:04.229 --> 03:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
statement but the message that I
 
03:26:06.110 --> 03:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
received was that they had no problem
 
03:26:07.309 --> 03:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
with this because they believed that
 
03:26:09.070 --> 03:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
people should be licensed in order to
 
03:26:09.080 --> 03:26:10.189 align:start position:0%
people should be licensed in order to
practice

03:26:10.189 --> 03:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
practice
 
03:26:12.110 --> 03:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy and it didn't raise to
 
03:26:14.349 --> 03:26:14.359 align:start position:0%
enough of a bar for them to come to this
 
03:26:18.349 --> 03:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
hearing okay thank you that's good to
 
03:26:22.429 --> 03:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
know right see what do they got
 
03:26:22.439 --> 03:26:28.110 align:start position:0%
know right see what do they got
there

03:26:28.110 --> 03:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:30.670 --> 03:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
exemptions I'll set this stuff here yeah
 
03:26:32.990 --> 03:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
there's specific definition of what a
 
03:26:36.229 --> 03:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
school psychologist and either at the
 
03:26:38.870 --> 03:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
doctoral or the specialist level in
 
03:26:42.030 --> 03:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
statute and in rules there's a
 
03:26:47.870 --> 03:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:51.870 --> 03:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
so so it said it unlawful for any person
 
03:26:54.389 --> 03:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
to do this except unless they are
 
03:26:57.070 --> 03:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
licensed or under the direct supervision
 
03:26:59.389 --> 03:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
of a
 
03:27:03.670 --> 03:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
lensey so that's there
 
03:27:07.110 --> 03:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
and so I think that
 
03:27:09.830 --> 03:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
the the question is whether your county
 
03:27:14.429 --> 03:27:14.439 align:start position:0%
jail can emplo can employ someone to uh
 
03:27:17.229 --> 03:27:17.239 align:start position:0%
perform Psychotherapy on the inmates
 
03:27:19.550 --> 03:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
without without a license and apparently
 
03:27:22.269 --> 03:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
this is sure no
 
03:27:24.790 --> 03:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
problem I I think so and the question is
 
03:27:27.510 --> 03:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
whether inmates also deserve that same
 
03:27:29.870 --> 03:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
right of same standard to have licensed
 
03:27:32.990 --> 03:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
professionals represent
 
03:27:36.910 --> 03:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
Bailey all of this being said I kind of
 
03:27:39.030 --> 03:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
begin to wonder about the fiscal note if
 
03:27:41.349 --> 03:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
there are people out there in the world
 
03:27:44.670 --> 03:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
pring practicing psychology or without a
 
03:27:47.389 --> 03:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
license and now we're going to take away
 
03:27:50.510 --> 03:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
that exemption and require it are we
 
03:27:52.590 --> 03:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
going to have to be hiring certified
 
03:27:54.429 --> 03:27:54.439 align:start position:0%
psychologists it is wouldn't that be
 
03:27:57.229 --> 03:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
more expensive than uncertified people
 
03:27:58.550 --> 03:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
who are doing it
 
03:28:02.189 --> 03:28:02.199 align:start position:0%
now well uh representative Pearson wants
 
03:28:03.910 --> 03:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
to jump in on my question to that would
 
03:28:06.030 --> 03:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
be what how expensive is one massive
 
03:28:08.189 --> 03:28:08.199 align:start position:0%
lawsuit I mean we're looking at a no no
 
03:28:11.309 --> 03:28:11.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not $350 million lawsuit right now
 
03:28:13.429 --> 03:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
out of the cunu center so I'm not
 
03:28:16.110 --> 03:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
questioning that I guess I'm questioning
 
03:28:17.750 --> 03:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be less than 10 grand
 
03:28:19.590 --> 03:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
for the next 3 years and not if you have
 
03:28:21.070 --> 03:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
to hire a whole bunch of people that are
 
03:28:24.910 --> 03:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
certified now I believe although this is
 
03:28:27.950 --> 03:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
purely my judgment they're saying we
 
03:28:30.550 --> 03:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
don't know of anybody who's actually
 
03:28:34.510 --> 03:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
doing this if there's just a couple it's
 
03:28:37.710 --> 03:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
one or two licensing fees which are
 
03:28:41.269 --> 03:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
which will be used by the
 
03:28:43.590 --> 03:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
oplc and and I didn't mean to question
 
03:28:46.229 --> 03:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
the the benefit of this just that the
 
03:28:48.389 --> 03:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal note doesn't seem to make sense
 
03:28:50.830 --> 03:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
oh well I I'm sure that they primarily
 
03:28:54.950 --> 03:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
considered licensing fees and not the uh
 
03:28:58.349 --> 03:28:58.359 align:start position:0%
the effect of of say your county jail
 
03:29:02.710 --> 03:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
having a $20,000 a year person doing
 
03:29:04.550 --> 03:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy and then they'd have to
 
03:29:09.150 --> 03:29:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
you see who they talk
 
03:29:16.990 --> 03:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
to yes repr grto okay you so I'm reading
 
03:29:21.189 --> 03:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
section two of um the
 
03:29:23.950 --> 03:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
RSA and you
 
03:29:27.229 --> 03:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
um want to eliminate section one you
 
03:29:31.590 --> 03:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
want to repeal one and why not
 
03:29:33.710 --> 03:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
two because this says that the
 
03:29:35.030 --> 03:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
03:29:37.790 --> 03:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
Education can credential individuals
 
03:29:40.429 --> 03:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
with the title certified school
 
03:29:42.590 --> 03:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
psychologist but a psychologist and a
 
03:29:45.550 --> 03:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
psychotherapist are not the same thing
 
03:29:48.229 --> 03:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
so why why would you not wipe out the
 
03:29:48.239 --> 03:29:50.349 align:start position:0%
so why why would you not wipe out the
whole

03:29:50.349 --> 03:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
whole
 
03:29:52.750 --> 03:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
thing I think that's a good point I
 
03:29:55.269 --> 03:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
think that we first want to look at
 
03:29:56.790 --> 03:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
having people who are completely
 
03:29:58.429 --> 03:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
unsupervised and completely
 
03:30:01.510 --> 03:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
unaccountable to anybody um I I think
 
03:30:03.750 --> 03:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
that that may actually go to some of the
 
03:30:06.630 --> 03:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
cost issue um I don't know if I I didn't
 
03:30:08.349 --> 03:30:08.359 align:start position:0%
look to see if anybody was licensed
 
03:30:09.870 --> 03:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
under those statutes from the Department
 
03:30:11.790 --> 03:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
of Education because I wasn't looking to
 
03:30:13.950 --> 03:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
impact those I was just looking to
 
03:30:16.030 --> 03:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
impact the looking to address the
 
03:30:18.269 --> 03:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
completely unlicensed practice of
 
03:30:21.469 --> 03:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
medicine um that and I'd be happy to
 
03:30:22.990 --> 03:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
look into that one and see if we should
 
03:30:24.510 --> 03:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
do that next year in order to remove
 
03:30:26.349 --> 03:30:26.359 align:start position:0%
that from the Department of Education
 
03:30:28.990 --> 03:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
whether that would be correct or
 
03:30:32.030 --> 03:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
not followup I think it's something that
 
03:30:34.950 --> 03:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
we can check for this year I don't see
 
03:30:37.469 --> 03:30:37.479 align:start position:0%
why we can't talk about this in
 
03:30:39.110 --> 03:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee if we if it goes to
 
03:30:40.910 --> 03:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee because I think that's an
 
03:30:40.920 --> 03:30:43.070 align:start position:0%
subcommittee because I think that's an
important

03:30:43.070 --> 03:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:30:44.990 --> 03:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
Point thank you I'll reach out to the
 
03:30:46.550 --> 03:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and get
 
03:30:49.229 --> 03:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
information from
 
03:30:49.239 --> 03:30:50.950 align:start position:0%
information from
them

03:30:50.950 --> 03:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:30:54.429 --> 03:30:54.439 align:start position:0%
okay my only my only fear in that is
 
03:30:56.469 --> 03:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
that if we if we go that one more
 
03:30:59.790 --> 03:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
paragraph is that that paragraph the
 
03:31:02.309 --> 03:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
purview of the education committe and
 
03:31:05.189 --> 03:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
not Edna I mean are we crossing crossing
 
03:31:07.990 --> 03:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
crafts here in essence are we you know
 
03:31:11.309 --> 03:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
what I mean is is that going to start to
 
03:31:13.309 --> 03:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
make that a two committee bill in
 
03:31:15.510 --> 03:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
essence that's just my only fear with
 
03:31:16.510 --> 03:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
that is
 
03:31:17.910 --> 03:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a really good point
 
03:31:19.389 --> 03:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
we don't want other committees doing
 
03:31:19.399 --> 03:31:26.750 align:start position:0%
we don't want other committees doing
Edna's

03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:29.870 --> 03:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
work um I believe that
 
03:31:37.710 --> 03:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:39.950 --> 03:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
title yeah that's
 
03:31:42.510 --> 03:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
interesting um I think it does need a a
 
03:31:46.590 --> 03:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
little bit of of checking to see um um
 
03:31:49.269 --> 03:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
what what they're doing but I did notice
 
03:31:51.309 --> 03:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
further up there's a
 
03:31:53.269 --> 03:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
definition uh in
 
03:31:56.389 --> 03:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
b15a of what a licensed school
 
03:31:59.150 --> 03:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
psychologist has the
 
03:32:03.349 --> 03:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
requirements so um I think that to to to
 
03:32:06.150 --> 03:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
look into whether that covers all the
 
03:32:08.429 --> 03:32:08.439 align:start position:0%
people that the Department of Education
 
03:32:10.229 --> 03:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
will credential or
 
03:32:13.349 --> 03:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
not uh would be
 
03:32:15.510 --> 03:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
worthwhile sorry about that I think it's
 
03:32:18.030 --> 03:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
going to go a subcommittee I'm I
 
03:32:20.269 --> 03:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
apologize no just just so I understand
 
03:32:22.349 --> 03:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
since I know where this is going
 
03:32:25.590 --> 03:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
um instead instead of taking the
 
03:32:27.830 --> 03:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
exemption route changing the definition
 
03:32:30.030 --> 03:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
route to cover this instead that would
 
03:32:33.550 --> 03:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
be legitimate um we just don't
 
03:32:36.830 --> 03:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
want the purpose is not to explicitly
 
03:32:39.429 --> 03:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
allow local governments to hire
 
03:32:44.229 --> 03:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
unqualified individuals sure okay and my
 
03:32:45.469 --> 03:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
understanding was that the Department of
 
03:32:47.590 --> 03:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
Education would be additive to repealing
 
03:32:49.710 --> 03:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
this section not replacing repealing
 
03:32:53.870 --> 03:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
this section okay well all right well we
 
03:32:56.349 --> 03:32:56.359 align:start position:0%
we will let this go to
 
03:32:58.710 --> 03:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee any further questions or
 
03:33:00.990 --> 03:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
issues to be brought
 
03:33:03.349 --> 03:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
up okay I don't see any thank you
 
03:33:06.070 --> 03:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative thank you is there anyone
 
03:33:08.150 --> 03:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
else who wishes to speak on House Bill
 
03:33:11.150 --> 03:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
227 actually Mr Fry you have answers to
 
03:33:23.229 --> 03:33:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:26.710 --> 03:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:30.070 --> 03:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
you how was it off there we
 
03:33:32.950 --> 03:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
go um so the fiscal note question when
 
03:33:35.150 --> 03:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
we wrote that fiscal note we based it
 
03:33:36.830 --> 03:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
off the instructions for the fiscal note
 
03:33:39.309 --> 03:33:39.319 align:start position:0%
worksheet which was to base it off of
 
03:33:41.630 --> 03:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
what is the impact on OPC so that's why
 
03:33:43.389 --> 03:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
as um representative Maguire was saying
 
03:33:45.429 --> 03:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
it was really more we were focused on
 
03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
what is the impact on
 
03:33:51.950 --> 03:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
licensing um so yes they also asked the
 
03:33:53.630 --> 03:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and health and
 
03:33:57.269 --> 03:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
human services so apparently it's not a
 
03:34:02.710 --> 03:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:06.750 --> 03:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
venues there any other questions I can
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%

03:34:12.710 --> 03:34:12.720 align:start position:0%

03:34:20.199 --> 03:34:22.110 align:start position:0%

03:35:00.429 --> 03:35:00.439 align:start position:0%
representatives along with h
 
03:35:02.950 --> 03:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative def from Rockingham
 
03:35:06.229 --> 03:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
District 29 representing the town of
 
03:35:09.030 --> 03:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
Hampton when I was in business school
 
03:35:10.349 --> 03:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
accounting was not one of the
 
03:35:13.990 --> 03:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
disciplines I shall we say uh easily
 
03:35:16.150 --> 03:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
embraced um I spent many Saturday
 
03:35:18.590 --> 03:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
mornings and supplemental classes
 
03:35:20.710 --> 03:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
offered to me and the few others of my
 
03:35:22.670 --> 03:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
classmates who were clearly not getting
 
03:35:25.110 --> 03:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
it that's why when I told some of my
 
03:35:27.429 --> 03:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
classmates at our fifth reunion that I
 
03:35:29.510 --> 03:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
was the uh Financial controller of a
 
03:35:31.189 --> 03:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
business unit they were
 
03:35:34.229 --> 03:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
shocked um it's also why I have the
 
03:35:36.830 --> 03:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
utmost respect for anyone who invested
 
03:35:38.389 --> 03:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
the time and effort to become a
 
03:35:39.950 --> 03:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
certified public
 
03:35:42.429 --> 03:35:42.439 align:start position:0%
accountant to become a CPA in New
 
03:35:44.870 --> 03:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today you must earn a
 
03:35:47.110 --> 03:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree or higher with 150
 
03:35:49.630 --> 03:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
semester hours from an accredited
 
03:35:50.590 --> 03:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
college or
 
03:35:53.349 --> 03:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
university complete 30 semester hours of
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
accounting courses including Financial
 
03:35:56.990 --> 03:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
Accounting management accounting
 
03:36:00.070 --> 03:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
auditing and Taxation complete 24
 
03:36:02.710 --> 03:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
semester hours of business courses pass
 
03:36:05.750 --> 03:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
the uniform CPA exam have no felony
 
03:36:07.630 --> 03:36:07.640 align:start position:0%

03:36:09.790 --> 03:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
full-time experience in accounting Andor
 
03:36:12.750 --> 03:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
audit skills and apply for and obtain it
 
03:36:15.630 --> 03:36:15.640 align:start position:0%

practice in the state that license must
 
03:36:20.790 --> 03:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
now be renewed every 2 years and to do
 
03:36:24.590 --> 03:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
so a CPA must complete 40 hours of
 
03:36:26.630 --> 03:36:26.640 align:start position:0%

03:36:29.229 --> 03:36:29.239 align:start position:0%

of four hours of Ethics training for
 
03:36:34.590 --> 03:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
each renewal period so in other words
 
03:36:36.550 --> 03:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
someone who is currently a
 
03:36:40.070 --> 03:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
CPA put in a great deal of time effort
 
03:36:43.110 --> 03:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
and money to pursue that career path and
 
03:36:45.189 --> 03:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
they should be justifiably proud of the
 
03:36:47.710 --> 03:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
accomplish M and the fact that they can
 
03:36:50.990 --> 03:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
include the title CPA after their
 
03:36:54.189 --> 03:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
name but then once they retire and their
 
03:36:57.110 --> 03:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
license laps lapses they are no longer
 
03:36:58.910 --> 03:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to include that title after
 
03:36:58.920 --> 03:37:00.030 align:start position:0%
allowed to include that title after
their

03:37:00.030 --> 03:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:37:04.189 --> 03:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
name HB 236 permits the office of
 
03:37:06.710 --> 03:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
professional liur and certification to
 
03:37:09.830 --> 03:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
Grant an individual who has retired and
 
03:37:11.830 --> 03:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
previously held a certificate as a
 
03:37:14.269 --> 03:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
certified public accountant the
 
03:37:17.830 --> 03:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
honorific title of CPA
 
03:37:20.590 --> 03:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
retired any individual who has granted
 
03:37:23.510 --> 03:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
that title may use it on a business card
 
03:37:26.150 --> 03:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
letter head email signature line or any
 
03:37:28.830 --> 03:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
other document or device but they may
 
03:37:31.469 --> 03:37:31.479 align:start position:0%
not use it to represent themselves or
 
03:37:33.870 --> 03:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
allow themselves to be represented as a
 
03:37:35.550 --> 03:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
current practicing
 
03:37:38.590 --> 03:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
CPA they may not also perform or offer
 
03:37:41.429 --> 03:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
to perform services for which a license
 
03:37:44.469 --> 03:37:44.479 align:start position:0%
certificate or permit may be required
 
03:37:46.670 --> 03:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
under state law
 
03:37:49.229 --> 03:37:49.239 align:start position:0%
not only is this a relatively simple way
 
03:37:52.469 --> 03:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
to recognize a lifetime's worth of work
 
03:37:55.189 --> 03:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
by these dedicated professionals it
 
03:37:57.269 --> 03:37:57.279 align:start position:0%
permits them to let organizations they
 
03:37:58.389 --> 03:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
may want to
 
03:38:00.910 --> 03:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
volunteer know that they have a
 
03:38:02.790 --> 03:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
particular skill that might be of
 
03:38:05.349 --> 03:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
significant benefit to those
 
03:38:08.469 --> 03:38:08.479 align:start position:0%
organizations someone with the title CPA
 
03:38:11.950 --> 03:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
retired for example will not be able to
 
03:38:14.070 --> 03:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
complete and sign off on the audited
 
03:38:17.229 --> 03:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
financials for their local food pantry
 
03:38:20.070 --> 03:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
or family animal shelter but they could
 
03:38:22.990 --> 03:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
certainly help those nonprofits organize
 
03:38:25.630 --> 03:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
and Report their financial results and
 
03:38:28.670 --> 03:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
knowing that a CPA retired is helping to
 
03:38:31.349 --> 03:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
oversee their finances that could very
 
03:38:33.030 --> 03:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
well help those organizations in their
 
03:38:33.040 --> 03:38:34.590 align:start position:0%
well help those organizations in their
fundraising

03:38:34.590 --> 03:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
fundraising
 
03:38:37.070 --> 03:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
efforts this bill was requested by the
 
03:38:39.630 --> 03:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
board of accountancy and it has been
 
03:38:41.550 --> 03:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the office of professional
 
03:38:43.030 --> 03:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
liur and
 
03:38:45.429 --> 03:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
certification well I cannot say whether
 
03:38:47.790 --> 03:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
opic supports the bill they certainly
 
03:38:49.830 --> 03:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
did not have any issues with the way it
 
03:38:49.840 --> 03:38:50.630 align:start position:0%
did not have any issues with the way it
is

03:38:50.630 --> 03:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:38:53.790 --> 03:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
worded I urge you to recommend this bill
 
03:38:55.510 --> 03:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass to our colleagues in
 
03:38:58.070 --> 03:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
the house and I'm happy to try to answer
 
03:39:00.910 --> 03:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have but as I
 
03:39:03.510 --> 03:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned accounting is not necessarily
 
03:39:05.790 --> 03:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
my thing and I believe there are some
 
03:39:07.790 --> 03:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
real accountants here who who can answer
 
03:39:10.389 --> 03:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
any detailed questions that you may have
 
03:39:10.399 --> 03:39:11.670 align:start position:0%
any detailed questions that you may have
thank

03:39:11.670 --> 03:39:11.680 align:start position:0%

you are there questions representative
 
03:39:14.040 --> 03:39:19.550 align:start position:0%
you are there questions representative
Pearson

03:39:19.550 --> 03:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:22.710 --> 03:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
let me give you the hypothetical
 
03:39:25.670 --> 03:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
that that you kind of just
 
03:39:28.030 --> 03:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
explained so you
 
03:39:30.590 --> 03:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
retire right I'm a licensed empt I
 
03:39:33.469 --> 03:39:33.479 align:start position:0%
retire from the fire
 
03:39:37.630 --> 03:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
service if you were to have a business
 
03:39:40.269 --> 03:39:40.279 align:start position:0%
card or if you were to to put simply
 
03:39:44.269 --> 03:39:44.279 align:start position:0%
that you are a CPA retired what law
 
03:39:45.990 --> 03:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
would you violate
 
03:39:48.990 --> 03:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
in just
 
03:39:51.030 --> 03:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
listing such a
 
03:39:56.030 --> 03:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
thing in other words is that isti 309
 
03:40:01.630 --> 03:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
b14 I think it's Roman 2 oh no Roman
 
03:40:04.510 --> 03:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
three no person not holding a valid
 
03:40:07.030 --> 03:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
certificate or practice privilege shall
 
03:40:10.189 --> 03:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
use or assume the title or designation
 
03:40:12.309 --> 03:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
certified public account or the
 
03:40:16.590 --> 03:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
abbreviation CPA or any other title Etc
 
03:40:18.429 --> 03:40:18.439 align:start position:0%
tending to indicate that such person is
 
03:40:22.389 --> 03:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
a CPA sure so but if you put CPA retired
 
03:40:25.070 --> 03:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
on a business card have you violated the
 
03:40:27.389 --> 03:40:27.399 align:start position:0%
law I believe the accountants are
 
03:40:30.790 --> 03:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
concerned that they it might be so
 
03:40:33.950 --> 03:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
considered so I the that's that's why
 
03:40:36.150 --> 03:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
this what this bill would do is a was
 
03:40:39.790 --> 03:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
create a new section in that RSA that
 
03:40:44.750 --> 03:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
specifically allows someone to um have a
 
03:40:47.750 --> 03:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
um have the CPA retired
 
03:40:50.510 --> 03:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
status I will say that that looking at
 
03:40:52.630 --> 03:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
that section there's about a page and a
 
03:40:55.389 --> 03:40:55.399 align:start position:0%
half of restrictions on the use of the
 
03:40:59.710 --> 03:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
title so it's it's fairly extensive that
 
03:41:02.910 --> 03:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
you can't call your yourself various
 
03:41:06.189 --> 03:41:06.199 align:start position:0%
accounting type things without a license
 
03:41:06.199 --> 03:41:11.790 align:start position:0%
accounting type things without a license
and

03:41:11.790 --> 03:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:15.790 --> 03:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure what the uh the whether
 
03:41:17.950 --> 03:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
this whole new title is exactly
 
03:41:20.670 --> 03:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
necessary but uh representa of cite well
 
03:41:22.429 --> 03:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
I'm prepared to vote for this violation
 
03:41:24.469 --> 03:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
of the First Amendment it's the truth
 
03:41:27.710 --> 03:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
you're a retired CPA and it no our state
 
03:41:33.550 --> 03:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:37.910 --> 03:41:37.920 align:start position:0%

and

03:41:59.309 --> 03:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:01.670 --> 03:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
comments no specific comments just to
 
03:42:03.510 --> 03:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
say we don't take any position on the
 
03:42:06.670 --> 03:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
bill okay anyone else wish to testify
 
03:42:06.680 --> 03:42:07.710 align:start position:0%
bill okay anyone else wish to testify
yes

03:42:07.710 --> 03:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:42:10.510 --> 03:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
please what's that repres me
 
03:42:12.830 --> 03:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative lean has a question uh
 
03:42:14.710 --> 03:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and um thank
 
03:42:17.469 --> 03:42:17.479 align:start position:0%
you would there be a cost to um doing
 
03:42:20.110 --> 03:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
this retired status certification yeah
 
03:42:23.790 --> 03:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
so in the we when we put together the
 
03:42:27.229 --> 03:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal note worksheet for this we um
 
03:42:29.349 --> 03:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
presumed a one-time
 
03:42:32.389 --> 03:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
cost and would you um as a followup
 
03:42:34.070 --> 03:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
would you need to have any authorization
 
03:42:36.429 --> 03:42:36.439 align:start position:0%
to charge a fee for that one-time cost I
 
03:42:38.189 --> 03:42:38.199 align:start position:0%
don't believe so we I pedal back and
 
03:42:39.990 --> 03:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
forth with this with someone at the
 
03:42:43.670 --> 03:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislative office and I cited RSA
 
03:42:46.030 --> 03:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
3104 or six I can't remember which of
 
03:42:47.870 --> 03:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
the two statutes but it's our fee
 
03:42:50.469 --> 03:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
statute and it gives us the authority to
 
03:42:54.790 --> 03:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
um do administrative fees thank
 
03:42:56.990 --> 03:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
you we're going to be making any other
 
03:42:59.229 --> 03:42:59.239 align:start position:0%
changes I would recommend we explicitly
 
03:43:03.070 --> 03:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
authorize the fee because that's it may
 
03:43:06.670 --> 03:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
not be 100% necessary but it's certainly
 
03:43:08.389 --> 03:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
recommended thank you that would be
 
03:43:11.910 --> 03:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
appreciated all right uh Richard uh
 
03:43:27.349 --> 03:43:27.359 align:start position:0%

stranger to begin with and I hope we
 
03:47:05.790 --> 03:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
will look and see if there's anybody
 
03:47:09.870 --> 03:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
online watching the hearing but uh you
 
03:47:12.750 --> 03:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
already spoke to the initial question I
 
03:47:16.510 --> 03:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
had uh with regard to what other states
 
03:47:20.030 --> 03:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh may have done or be doing um are you
 
03:47:24.030 --> 03:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
aware whether of how long this uh
 
03:47:27.469 --> 03:47:27.479 align:start position:0%
concept has been in in uh existence in
 
03:47:30.550 --> 03:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
other states and what kind of a re re
 
03:47:34.950 --> 03:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
result or reaction it's had well I uh
 
03:47:37.750 --> 03:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
like I said in since 2018 it became part
 
03:47:39.870 --> 03:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
of the uniform accountancy act so that's
 
03:47:44.950 --> 03:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
when states started to adopt it um and I
 
03:47:48.910 --> 03:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
know from talking to one other chairman
 
03:47:53.189 --> 03:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
who of one of the other uh boards state
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
boards that within the last two years
 
03:47:58.830 --> 03:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
has passed it they had a significant
 
03:48:02.590 --> 03:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
amount of CPAs who were in this inactive
 
03:48:05.189 --> 03:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
or expired status apply for it and were
 
03:48:08.750 --> 03:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
granted it so it has been popular in the
 
03:48:12.429 --> 03:48:12.439 align:start position:0%
states that have accepted it well I just
 
03:48:15.550 --> 03:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
will say that uh followup
 
03:48:20.510 --> 03:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
that um as a regular user of CPA
 
03:48:23.750 --> 03:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
Services over number of years I
 
03:48:25.950 --> 03:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
recognize the tremendous expertise that
 
03:48:28.630 --> 03:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
you have to have to do the job and you
 
03:48:31.469 --> 03:48:31.479 align:start position:0%
have to have nerves of Steel uh to be
 
03:48:32.990 --> 03:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
willing to take
 
03:48:35.830 --> 03:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
on I haven't brought in a box shoe box
 
03:48:38.550 --> 03:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
full of but I know it's a common
 
03:48:40.950 --> 03:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
phenomenon that you have to Wade through
 
03:48:43.309 --> 03:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
so and your question Lu would you
 
03:48:45.830 --> 03:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
03:48:48.750 --> 03:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
yes are there any questions
 
03:48:48.760 --> 03:48:54.309 align:start position:0%
yes are there any questions
representative

03:48:54.309 --> 03:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
Pearson what
 
03:48:59.670 --> 03:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
happens so you know the status you have
 
03:49:01.510 --> 03:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
to be you know you had had to be a CPA
 
03:49:03.590 --> 03:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
had to make 55 years of age and all that
 
03:49:05.750 --> 03:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
what happens if you enter into the
 
03:49:07.750 --> 03:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
retired status and decide you want to go
 
03:49:11.670 --> 03:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
back next to being a CPA and you don't
 
03:49:14.550 --> 03:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
want to necessarily be retired anymore
 
03:49:17.670 --> 03:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
what what happens then you can
 
03:49:21.510 --> 03:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
reapply and you have to present evidence
 
03:49:24.469 --> 03:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
of continuing professional
 
03:49:27.030 --> 03:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
education uh under the current
 
03:49:30.510 --> 03:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
requirements of granting a license so
 
03:49:33.670 --> 03:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
for there is a section of the statute on
 
03:49:35.910 --> 03:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
reinstate licensed
 
03:49:38.510 --> 03:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
reinstatement and coming back from
 
03:49:40.670 --> 03:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
retirement would would would qualify
 
03:49:42.870 --> 03:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
right because currently some CPAs are in
 
03:49:46.389 --> 03:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
the category I discussed earlier which
 
03:49:50.710 --> 03:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
is the inactive status and there is a a
 
03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
a provision for them to come back and
 
03:49:56.710 --> 03:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
that would apply to retired CPAs as well
 
03:49:59.670 --> 03:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
so they would be treated as
 
03:49:59.680 --> 03:50:01.910 align:start position:0%
so they would be treated as
inactive

03:50:01.910 --> 03:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
inactive
 
03:50:04.110 --> 03:50:04.120 align:start position:0%
okay well actually they're more
 
03:50:06.670 --> 03:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
restricted inactive can
 
03:50:06.680 --> 03:50:08.309 align:start position:0%
restricted inactive can
do

03:50:08.309 --> 03:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:50:11.110 --> 03:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
um they can't there's a few there's some
 
03:50:15.070 --> 03:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
other things inactive CPAs can do no no
 
03:50:16.590 --> 03:50:16.600 align:start position:0%
okay well then why don't we just let
 
03:50:18.950 --> 03:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
them why don't we just retitle the
 
03:50:21.269 --> 03:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
inactive to
 
03:50:24.670 --> 03:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
retired uh the inactive is really there
 
03:50:28.750 --> 03:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
so people who want to come back into the
 
03:50:30.349 --> 03:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
profession for some reason have gone
 
03:50:32.670 --> 03:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
into industry don't want to do the
 
03:50:35.590 --> 03:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
current CPE have done it retired is more
 
03:50:39.110 --> 03:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
for people like myself that want to
 
03:50:41.790 --> 03:50:41.800 align:start position:0%
serve on boards and serve the public and
 
03:50:45.149 --> 03:50:45.159 align:start position:0%
don't have any desire to to work
 
03:50:47.269 --> 03:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
anymore thank
 
03:50:51.030 --> 03:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
you all right any other
 
03:50:53.030 --> 03:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
03:50:54.790 --> 03:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you very much
 
03:50:56.630 --> 03:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
is there is there anyone else who wishes
 
03:51:01.309 --> 03:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:03.910 --> 03:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
236 all right seeing none I'll close the
 
03:51:03.920 --> 03:51:05.349 align:start position:0%
236 all right seeing none I'll close the
public

03:51:05.349 --> 03:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:51:08.229 --> 03:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
hearing do we have anybody mam chair do
 
03:51:10.229 --> 03:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
we have anybody online who's been
 
03:51:11.590 --> 03:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
watching the
 
03:51:15.189 --> 03:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
hearing I don't think we can see that
 
03:51:18.670 --> 03:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
we can't tell as far as I know
 
03:51:20.790 --> 03:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative representative Pearson do
 
03:51:23.309 --> 03:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
you think we should uh go into executive
 
03:51:28.750 --> 03:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:31.630 --> 03:51:31.640 align:start position:0%
this okay let's go into executive
 
03:51:34.710 --> 03:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 236 does someone
 
03:51:39.070 --> 03:51:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:41.349 --> 03:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
motion I'm I'm getting a hay eyeball
 
03:51:44.110 --> 03:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
from Jackie so sure I'll make the motion
 
03:51:45.590 --> 03:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
to AUD pass
 
03:51:48.189 --> 03:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
236 all right representative Pearson
 
03:51:52.510 --> 03:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
moves on to pass I'll second that
 
03:51:55.750 --> 03:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
second ah sellers all
 
03:51:57.750 --> 03:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
right do you wish to speak to your
 
03:52:01.630 --> 03:52:01.640 align:start position:0%
motion sure the um I think it was well
 
03:52:03.990 --> 03:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
explained the questions were
 
03:52:04.000 --> 03:52:06.469 align:start position:0%
explained the questions were
answered

03:52:06.469 --> 03:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
answered
 
03:52:09.670 --> 03:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
I had no idea that CPAs were very
 
03:52:11.710 --> 03:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
specifically restricted in the way they
 
03:52:13.830 --> 03:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
could identify themselves retired which
 
03:52:15.469 --> 03:52:15.479 align:start position:0%
I I agree with representative scitec in
 
03:52:17.590 --> 03:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
the in the sense that H how is this even
 
03:52:21.510 --> 03:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
a thing so um this seems like uh there's
 
03:52:24.149 --> 03:52:24.159 align:start position:0%
no risk to the public here it's not a I
 
03:52:26.870 --> 03:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
don't think it's deceptive in any way so
 
03:52:30.750 --> 03:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh I I see no issue with it thank you
 
03:52:32.229 --> 03:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
representative zers you wish to speak to
 
03:52:33.910 --> 03:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
your second I was going to say yes thank
 
03:52:39.630 --> 03:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:42.870 --> 03:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
titles okay uh that's very true
 
03:52:45.149 --> 03:52:45.159 align:start position:0%
represent groda
 
03:52:47.990 --> 03:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
so if we pass this there's nothing in
 
03:52:50.870 --> 03:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
here that that tells that says that they
 
03:52:54.670 --> 03:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
have to that oplc can charge a
 
03:52:59.030 --> 03:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
fee and I'm first of all I'm sort of on
 
03:53:01.990 --> 03:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
the fence on this bill
 
03:53:04.229 --> 03:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
because I can't think of any other
 
03:53:07.830 --> 03:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
profession where you can't use your
 
03:53:11.229 --> 03:53:11.239 align:start position:0%
title and say you're retired so I don't
 
03:53:11.239 --> 03:53:12.630 align:start position:0%
title and say you're retired so I don't
know

03:53:12.630 --> 03:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:53:16.510 --> 03:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
why I mean the CPA organ board may not
 
03:53:19.830 --> 03:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
like it but so what I'm trying
 
03:53:22.469 --> 03:53:22.479 align:start position:0%
to you know can I throw a 180 at you
 
03:53:23.950 --> 03:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
representative gr you can throw me
 
03:53:26.710 --> 03:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
whatever you want okay so with all the
 
03:53:28.469 --> 03:53:28.479 align:start position:0%
other professions there's no restriction
 
03:53:30.830 --> 03:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
to say that you are
 
03:53:33.510 --> 03:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
retired necessarily
 
03:53:38.110 --> 03:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
like why here why why this one
 
03:53:40.790 --> 03:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
specifically being prohibitive in
 
03:53:42.710 --> 03:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
statute I when I retire from the fire
 
03:53:44.030 --> 03:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
service it doesn't say that they can't
 
03:53:47.189 --> 03:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
say that but it does it there are a lot
 
03:53:51.030 --> 03:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
of res a lot of explicit restrictions on
 
03:53:54.429 --> 03:53:54.439 align:start position:0%
calling yourself a CPA it's not clear
 
03:53:57.189 --> 03:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
that calling yourself a retired CPA
 
03:54:01.870 --> 03:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:04.630 --> 03:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
law from what I understand what what
 
03:54:06.429 --> 03:54:06.439 align:start position:0%
representative what the chair is saying
 
03:54:08.510 --> 03:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
and I remember when we went through all
 
03:54:11.590 --> 03:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
the CPA stuff there is nothing that says
 
03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
they can't say CPA retired it's not in
 
03:54:17.550 --> 03:54:17.560 align:start position:0%
statute they're assuming that because
 
03:54:20.429 --> 03:54:20.439 align:start position:0%
the other requirements are so
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
stringent so did they you know did the
 
03:54:27.429 --> 03:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
board box itself in and is there I'm
 
03:54:29.950 --> 03:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
just asking the question because I mean
 
03:54:32.110 --> 03:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
in essence if they are not if there's
 
03:54:34.149 --> 03:54:34.159 align:start position:0%
really no explicit restriction for their
 
03:54:36.229 --> 03:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
for them to use the title then there's
 
03:54:37.990 --> 03:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
really no reason for the oplc to have to
 
03:54:40.030 --> 03:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
charge anything to do
 
03:54:43.149 --> 03:54:43.159 align:start position:0%
anything they this just kind of I guess
 
03:54:45.670 --> 03:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
makes it where we're kind of saying hey
 
03:54:48.469 --> 03:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
you can do it and don't worry about it
 
03:54:50.510 --> 03:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
if you know what I mean because if it's
 
03:54:53.630 --> 03:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:57.269 --> 03:54:57.279 align:start position:0%
illegal yes exactly represent Leon uh
 
03:55:00.229 --> 03:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman uh previous to
 
03:55:01.870 --> 03:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
this my understanding around the use of
 
03:55:03.910 --> 03:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
CPA was almost like they had trademarked
 
03:55:05.550 --> 03:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
it because they had Pro built so many
 
03:55:07.670 --> 03:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
protections around the use of that term
 
03:55:08.910 --> 03:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
and now they had built up those
 
03:55:10.710 --> 03:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
protections so much that now there's a
 
03:55:13.950 --> 03:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
concern about using it to me I see the
 
03:55:16.429 --> 03:55:16.439 align:start position:0%
two pass of if you created that much and
 
03:55:18.309 --> 03:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
you want to have a new regulatory path
 
03:55:20.870 --> 03:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
for a retired certification we should
 
03:55:22.030 --> 03:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're charging the
 
03:55:23.590 --> 03:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
administrative fee for the time that it
 
03:55:26.750 --> 03:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
takes from oplc or perhaps look to the
 
03:55:29.189 --> 03:55:29.199 align:start position:0%
language that says that you can't use it
 
03:55:31.229 --> 03:55:31.239 align:start position:0%
um and say and add to those exemptions
 
03:55:33.990 --> 03:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
for using the title CPA unless you've
 
03:55:36.229 --> 03:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
retired in good standing um unless
 
03:55:37.830 --> 03:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
you've unless when you stopped
 
03:55:39.149 --> 03:55:39.159 align:start position:0%
practicing you were in good standing and
 
03:55:41.830 --> 03:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
have not done it separately I recognize
 
03:55:43.229 --> 03:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
the value of having the model
 
03:55:45.149 --> 03:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
legislation across the state so that
 
03:55:47.429 --> 03:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
there's consistency but in that case I'd
 
03:55:48.990 --> 03:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
want to make ensure that we're able to
 
03:55:51.269 --> 03:55:51.279 align:start position:0%
charge that fee for the time for
 
03:55:55.189 --> 03:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
OPC represent s suppose oplc does
 
03:55:57.429 --> 03:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
nothing and we just print the cards and
 
03:55:59.870 --> 03:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
the law authorizes
 
03:56:04.070 --> 03:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
it I'm that works for me representative
 
03:56:06.389 --> 03:56:06.399 align:start position:0%
Pearson well I I guess it just boils
 
03:56:06.399 --> 03:56:08.030 align:start position:0%
Pearson well I I guess it just boils
down

03:56:08.030 --> 03:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
down
 
03:56:10.670 --> 03:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
to are we is this just enabling in the
 
03:56:13.309 --> 03:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
sense of allowing the use of the term or
 
03:56:14.910 --> 03:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
are we now
 
03:56:16.630 --> 03:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
taking it a step further and saying that
 
03:56:19.469 --> 03:56:19.479 align:start position:0%
the office of the oplc is going to have
 
03:56:23.070 --> 03:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
some sort of a list or a tracking or a
 
03:56:25.469 --> 03:56:25.479 align:start position:0%
database where someone would hence
 
03:56:29.149 --> 03:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
verify that someone's retired as a CPA
 
03:56:31.110 --> 03:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
you see what I'm saying yes I understand
 
03:56:33.710 --> 03:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
if we're just saying it's not illegal
 
03:56:35.469 --> 03:56:35.479 align:start position:0%
that's one
 
03:56:38.830 --> 03:56:38.840 align:start position:0%
thing but this so I can can we can we
 
03:56:41.229 --> 03:56:41.239 align:start position:0%
have the sponsor come up and maybe ask
 
03:56:43.349 --> 03:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
him what the intention here is then is
 
03:56:44.790 --> 03:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
to what they're looking for
 
03:56:44.800 --> 03:56:47.910 align:start position:0%
to what they're looking for
or

03:56:47.910 --> 03:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:51.030 --> 03:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
someone I ask could I ask Mr Silverman
 
03:56:53.349 --> 03:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
to join me
 
03:56:55.790 --> 03:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
sure the the question is are you
 
03:56:59.189 --> 03:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
intending to have the oplc keep records
 
03:57:03.030 --> 03:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
of this or is it just something that Mr
 
03:57:05.070 --> 03:57:05.080 align:start position:0%
Silverman could put on his card or when
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
he's on the board of a the local food
 
03:57:11.269 --> 03:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
bank or whatever um go ahead currently
 
03:57:13.790 --> 03:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
the oplc does keep records of all of us
 
03:57:17.110 --> 03:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
as to our status whether it's expired
 
03:57:20.070 --> 03:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
our license is expired whether we've
 
03:57:24.469 --> 03:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
asked for inactive status or we are
 
03:57:27.189 --> 03:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
currently renewed so they're already
 
03:57:29.510 --> 03:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
keeping track of what we do it would be
 
03:57:33.349 --> 03:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
just another category they would have so
 
03:57:36.349 --> 03:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
we would submit an uh an application to
 
03:57:36.359 --> 03:57:37.189 align:start position:0%
we would submit an uh an application to
be

03:57:37.189 --> 03:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:57:40.189 --> 03:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
retired somebody at LP would check that
 
03:57:43.309 --> 03:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
we have been or are currently in good
 
03:57:43.319 --> 03:57:44.990 align:start position:0%
we have been or are currently in good
standing

03:57:44.990 --> 03:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
standing
 
03:57:46.510 --> 03:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:57:50.269 --> 03:57:50.279 align:start position:0%
would allow us to enter the retired
 
03:57:52.710 --> 03:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
category representative Pearson then
 
03:57:54.790 --> 03:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
that was that's going to have a cost to
 
03:57:57.990 --> 03:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
it if that's what they want I don't I
 
03:58:00.950 --> 03:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
don't see a problem with a minimal
 
03:58:02.870 --> 03:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
one-time cost for getting it because
 
03:58:05.550 --> 03:58:05.560 align:start position:0%
somebody does has to have to look it up
 
03:58:08.910 --> 03:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
I don't you know renew your license is a
 
03:58:10.630 --> 03:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
lot more detailed because they have to
 
03:58:12.630 --> 03:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
check for your continuing professional
 
03:58:14.950 --> 03:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
education requirements this basically is
 
03:58:17.710 --> 03:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
to check the database to see if you're
 
03:58:18.790 --> 03:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
in good
 
03:58:21.389 --> 03:58:21.399 align:start position:0%
standing and you know what your current
 
03:58:23.429 --> 03:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
status is so I I don't have a problem
 
03:58:26.630 --> 03:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
with that at all okay so Madam chair the
 
03:58:27.710 --> 03:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
question is then is this going to be
 
03:58:28.910 --> 03:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
something that's handled through rules
 
03:58:31.389 --> 03:58:31.399 align:start position:0%
or do we or are we going to explicitly
 
03:58:34.389 --> 03:58:34.399 align:start position:0%
outline what the fee for this status
 
03:58:35.550 --> 03:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
will be in
 
03:58:39.550 --> 03:58:39.560 align:start position:0%
statute since oplc has the authority to
 
03:58:43.229 --> 03:58:43.239 align:start position:0%
do that representative sellers thank you
 
03:58:47.590 --> 03:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
m chair so on on line um
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
15 it says that they um they sh they
 
03:58:52.910 --> 03:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
shall Grant a
 
03:58:56.110 --> 03:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
certificate stating that they're retired
 
03:58:58.790 --> 03:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
so op PLC at least has got to do one
 
03:59:01.830 --> 03:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
step see that they were working and had
 
03:59:03.990 --> 03:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
a license and now they're
 
03:59:06.750 --> 03:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
retired so it doesn't seem like an awful
 
03:59:11.030 --> 03:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:14.630 --> 03:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
oplc okay M Madam Madam chairman
 
03:59:17.590 --> 03:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
ask representative M you um I I guess in
 
03:59:21.630 --> 03:59:21.640 align:start position:0%
in you know um with regard to you know
 
03:59:23.990 --> 03:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
do you include the specifics of a fee in
 
03:59:26.830 --> 03:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
the bill or not I mean and maybe oplc
 
03:59:29.149 --> 03:59:29.159 align:start position:0%
can answer this I don't know what is I
 
03:59:31.269 --> 03:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
don't know if there is a specific fee in
 
03:59:34.229 --> 03:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
legislation right now for somebody
 
03:59:36.110 --> 03:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
applying to be a CPA or whether that's
 
03:59:37.349 --> 03:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
something that they just do through
 
03:59:39.950 --> 03:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
their rules process it I I think follow
 
03:59:42.910 --> 03:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
it's been in both both places uh I think
 
03:59:45.550 --> 03:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
it's in rules at the
 
03:59:48.590 --> 03:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
moment intended to cover the
 
03:59:48.600 --> 03:59:50.710 align:start position:0%
moment intended to cover the
costc

03:59:50.710 --> 03:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
costc
 
03:59:55.830 --> 03:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
set all right any further comments
 
03:59:58.510 --> 03:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
questions all right I'm I think I'm with
 
04:00:00.229 --> 04:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
representative scitec and I don't not
 
04:00:03.469 --> 04:00:03.479 align:start position:0%
sure this is entirely necessary but uh
 
04:00:05.670 --> 04:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
if the CPAs have wrapped their titles in
 
04:00:10.229 --> 04:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:13.469 --> 04:00:13.479 align:start position:0%
it's anyone else comments questions
 
04:00:13.479 --> 04:00:15.309 align:start position:0%
it's anyone else comments questions
issues

04:00:15.309 --> 04:00:15.319 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:00:17.910 --> 04:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
represent I just want to be
 
04:00:17.920 --> 04:00:19.469 align:start position:0%
represent I just want to be
clear

04:00:19.469 --> 04:00:19.479 align:start position:0%
clear
 
04:00:23.070 --> 04:00:23.080 align:start position:0%
that if we don't collect fee for
 
04:00:25.710 --> 04:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
this which it doesn't say that we're
 
04:00:28.070 --> 04:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
going to do that then that means they
 
04:00:29.710 --> 04:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
get their certificate and that's the end
 
04:00:32.750 --> 04:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
of the deal they're cut loose and they
 
04:00:35.149 --> 04:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
do what they want and if I mean they put
 
04:00:38.269 --> 04:00:38.279 align:start position:0%
CPA retired and if somebody who is in a
 
04:00:40.389 --> 04:00:40.399 align:start position:0%
CPA and put CPA
 
04:00:42.429 --> 04:00:42.439 align:start position:0%
retired then what I mean what does that
 
04:00:44.389 --> 04:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
mean nothing right and basically means
 
04:00:45.870 --> 04:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
it's a nothing
 
04:00:49.389 --> 04:00:49.399 align:start position:0%
thing and who who is to enforce this
 
04:00:52.870 --> 04:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
right that's you know am I making this
 
04:00:54.710 --> 04:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
too complicated I just want to
 
04:00:56.189 --> 04:00:56.199 align:start position:0%
understand I we're going through the
 
04:00:58.630 --> 04:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
same me when we talk about licensing and
 
04:01:02.950 --> 04:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
we talk about these kinds of things we
 
04:01:05.630 --> 04:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
have hearty discussions about them
 
04:01:07.070 --> 04:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
because they're important things they
 
04:01:11.590 --> 04:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:13.750 --> 04:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
something I I mean I like I said I have
 
04:01:15.750 --> 04:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
if if the office of oplc is going to
 
04:01:17.070 --> 04:01:17.080 align:start position:0%
have to maintain a database and they're
 
04:01:19.309 --> 04:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
going to have to process this that is an
 
04:01:23.349 --> 04:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
incor cost yes no question so I I don't
 
04:01:24.510 --> 04:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a problem that under
 
04:01:25.590 --> 04:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
the current method in which they're
 
04:01:27.750 --> 04:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
operating and that they'll figure out
 
04:01:29.389 --> 04:01:29.399 align:start position:0%
the very minuscule amount of work that
 
04:01:31.189 --> 04:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
this does take and aign a value to that
 
04:01:33.149 --> 04:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
that's fine and I do agree with you
 
04:01:34.389 --> 04:01:34.399 align:start position:0%
representative Grotto that it is not
 
04:01:35.950 --> 04:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
outlined in here and that would require
 
04:01:37.750 --> 04:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to put that in there and I
 
04:01:38.750 --> 04:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have a problem with
 
04:01:41.070 --> 04:01:41.080 align:start position:0%
that either it's just like I said we
 
04:01:42.469 --> 04:01:42.479 align:start position:0%
were just you know just trying to figure
 
04:01:44.429 --> 04:01:44.439 align:start position:0%
out what exactly they're going for here
 
04:01:47.830 --> 04:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
and make make that match
 
04:01:52.469 --> 04:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
this repres so This leans to then
 
04:01:56.309 --> 04:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
legislative intent so I just want Mr
 
04:01:59.229 --> 04:01:59.239 align:start position:0%
Silverman to understand that right now
 
04:02:01.030 --> 04:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
all we're saying is there's going to be
 
04:02:02.710 --> 04:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
a list someplace that's going to have
 
04:02:04.550 --> 04:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
your name checked off as retired and
 
04:02:04.560 --> 04:02:05.790 align:start position:0%
your name checked off as retired and
that's

04:02:05.790 --> 04:02:05.800 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:02:08.830 --> 04:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
it there's going to be no database
 
04:02:11.309 --> 04:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
management of who's following the
 
04:02:14.070 --> 04:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
retirement law and who isn't
 
04:02:16.550 --> 04:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
does you that is that clear to
 
04:02:19.870 --> 04:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
you it's like anything else that comes
 
04:02:22.349 --> 04:02:22.359 align:start position:0%
before the board if somebody violate
 
04:02:25.269 --> 04:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
something and somebody files a complaint
 
04:02:28.149 --> 04:02:28.159 align:start position:0%
it would come before the board and then
 
04:02:30.469 --> 04:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
the board would have to address that
 
04:02:34.110 --> 04:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
complaint just like if you know if a CPA
 
04:02:36.950 --> 04:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
violated a provision and come and you
 
04:02:39.750 --> 04:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
filed a complaint against that CPA board
 
04:02:42.389 --> 04:02:42.399 align:start position:0%
meets and makes a determination with the
 
04:02:44.469 --> 04:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
office of enforcement it would be the
 
04:02:46.229 --> 04:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
exact same
 
04:02:48.830 --> 04:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
thing and the only violation I could see
 
04:02:50.189 --> 04:02:50.199 align:start position:0%
is if they
 
04:02:54.030 --> 04:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
were practicing things that they were
 
04:02:56.670 --> 04:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
not allowed to practice for instance
 
04:02:58.750 --> 04:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
certifying financial statements signing
 
04:03:01.750 --> 04:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
and aining on financial statements or if
 
04:03:01.760 --> 04:03:02.870 align:start position:0%
and aining on financial statements or if
a

04:03:02.870 --> 04:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:03:05.710 --> 04:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
bookkeeper with who had never been a CPA
 
04:03:08.870 --> 04:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
decided to put CPA retired on his
 
04:03:12.830 --> 04:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
business card that would cause the oplc
 
04:03:14.830 --> 04:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
to enforce it if someone complained we
 
04:03:16.710 --> 04:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
would send that directly to
 
04:03:18.790 --> 04:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement thank
 
04:03:21.870 --> 04:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
you any other comments representative
 
04:03:24.309 --> 04:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
land um thank you madam chair uh looking
 
04:03:27.309 --> 04:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
at this stat the section 309b um this
 
04:03:28.389 --> 04:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
would fall under all the other
 
04:03:31.469 --> 04:03:31.479 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority um so I I think
 
04:03:33.070 --> 04:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
that I was may have been jumping the gun
 
04:03:35.030 --> 04:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
thinking we need to specifically add the
 
04:03:36.990 --> 04:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
ability to charge the fee into this I
 
04:03:38.030 --> 04:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure we weren't
 
04:03:40.670 --> 04:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
causing a problem but if we whenever we
 
04:03:42.710 --> 04:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
write this up if we make it clear that
 
04:03:44.630 --> 04:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
we intend for them to be charged an
 
04:03:47.149 --> 04:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate fee in the blur that would
 
04:03:49.790 --> 04:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
probably be helpful
 
04:03:53.349 --> 04:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else all right that case I
 
04:03:55.469 --> 04:03:55.479 align:start position:0%
think we should wrap this up in that
 
04:03:57.550 --> 04:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
case I'm going to have to withdraw then
 
04:04:00.110 --> 04:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
the the autop pass motion if this needs
 
04:04:02.229 --> 04:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
to be amended no no she's saying it
 
04:04:03.510 --> 04:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be it doesn't need to be
 
04:04:05.070 --> 04:04:05.080 align:start position:0%
amended because it's already covered
 
04:04:06.870 --> 04:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
yeah gotcha and what I'm saying is that
 
04:04:08.429 --> 04:04:08.439 align:start position:0%
you're right that it's our expectation
 
04:04:09.790 --> 04:04:09.800 align:start position:0%
that they would do it it's minor so it
 
04:04:12.309 --> 04:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
would only be a minor minor fee to issue
 
04:04:12.319 --> 04:04:13.910 align:start position:0%
would only be a minor minor fee to issue
this

04:04:13.910 --> 04:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:04:16.189 --> 04:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
okay the motion is ought to pass by
 
04:04:18.670 --> 04:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson and the clerk can
 
04:04:22.349 --> 04:04:22.359 align:start position:0%

chair no I still don't think it's
 
04:05:13.469 --> 04:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
necessary you're going to vote no okay
 
04:05:13.479 --> 04:05:14.870 align:start position:0%
necessary you're going to vote no okay
um

04:05:14.870 --> 04:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:18.630 --> 04:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
111 do you uh okay the motion passes 11
 
04:05:21.389 --> 04:05:21.399 align:start position:0%
to one I will not be writing a Minority
 
04:05:24.349 --> 04:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
Report are you okay with consent I
 
04:05:25.550 --> 04:05:25.560 align:start position:0%

04:05:47.510 --> 04:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
all right in that case we're coming out
 
04:05:51.670 --> 04:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
of executive session and I'm opening
 
04:05:54.429 --> 04:05:54.439 align:start position:0%
the you let a few more people bring in
 
04:05:57.269 --> 04:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:59.590 --> 04:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
cards if you're a representative you're
 
04:06:00.950 --> 04:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
towards the
 
04:06:00.960 --> 04:06:05.790 align:start position:0%
towards the
top

04:06:05.790 --> 04:06:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:07.510 --> 04:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's thank
 
04:06:10.469 --> 04:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
you that's fine all right thank you I've
 
04:06:17.189 --> 04:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:20.269 --> 04:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
um I'm calling representative peternell
 
04:06:22.590 --> 04:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
as one of the sponsors in place of the
 
04:06:30.870 --> 04:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:33.309 --> 04:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
sick good afternoon Madame chairwoman
 
04:06:35.389 --> 04:06:35.399 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee um for the
 
04:06:37.349 --> 04:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
record my name is Katie Pell and I
 
04:06:40.149 --> 04:06:40.159 align:start position:0%
represent um Carol district 6 the towns
 
04:06:43.590 --> 04:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
of wolfboro and Tuftonboro I'm here
 
04:06:46.349 --> 04:06:46.359 align:start position:0%
today I'm a co-sponsor on this bill but
 
04:06:48.910 --> 04:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
I am um introducing the bill for
 
04:06:50.790 --> 04:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt who could not be
 
04:06:52.990 --> 04:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
here today and I just received his
 
04:06:54.710 --> 04:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
testimony an hour ago so I can't
 
04:06:56.790 --> 04:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily answer a lot of technical
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
questions about this bill but I'm more
 
04:07:02.830 --> 04:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
than happy to be a supporter of it uh HB
 
04:07:05.830 --> 04:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
349 expands the scope of practice for
 
04:07:08.590 --> 04:07:08.600 align:start position:0%
licensed optometrist to perform three
 
04:07:13.070 --> 04:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
specific opth Opthalmic laser procedures
 
04:07:15.269 --> 04:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
provided that the practitioner is first
 
04:07:17.429 --> 04:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
certified by the board of registration
 
04:07:17.439 --> 04:07:18.750 align:start position:0%
certified by the board of registration
in

04:07:18.750 --> 04:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:07:22.349 --> 04:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
Optometry so this bill um is similar to
 
04:07:26.109 --> 04:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
last year's Senate Bill 440 which passed
 
04:07:28.189 --> 04:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
the Senate on a Voice vote and came out
 
04:07:30.750 --> 04:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
of this committee with a 14-6
 
04:07:33.670 --> 04:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation of ought to pass so while
 
04:07:36.830 --> 04:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
SB 440 expanded the scope of practice
 
04:07:38.990 --> 04:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
for optomet interest in a number of ways
 
04:07:41.950 --> 04:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
HB 349 is far more limited and would
 
04:07:44.429 --> 04:07:44.439 align:start position:0%
simply allow for these three specific
 
04:07:46.750 --> 04:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
procedures for which most many
 
04:07:48.389 --> 04:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
optometrists are trained but not
 
04:07:50.469 --> 04:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
currently authorized to perform in New
 
04:07:52.349 --> 04:07:52.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and this is something that I
 
04:07:54.910 --> 04:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
did not know until I got received this
 
04:07:57.189 --> 04:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
testimony but Optometry is the only
 
04:07:58.790 --> 04:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
profession for which permitted
 
04:08:01.630 --> 04:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
procedures are Del delineated within
 
04:08:04.510 --> 04:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
State Statute while that seems
 
04:08:06.349 --> 04:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
problematic this bill does not aim to
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
address the broader problem of uh
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
allowing them to
 
04:08:15.229 --> 04:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:08:15.239 --> 04:08:16.910 align:start position:0%
um uh
sorry

04:08:16.910 --> 04:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:08:20.389 --> 04:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
um to manage their own um practice scope
 
04:08:23.349 --> 04:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
of practice in this case the focus is on
 
04:08:26.830 --> 04:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
these three specific um procedures those
 
04:08:29.670 --> 04:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
three procedures are laser capsulotomy
 
04:08:32.149 --> 04:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
which is a procedure that treats
 
04:08:35.229 --> 04:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
complications after cataract surgery
 
04:08:38.389 --> 04:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
laser tacul plasty and Laser peripheral
 
04:08:40.590 --> 04:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
iridotomy and those are both
 
04:08:43.710 --> 04:08:43.720 align:start position:0%
treatments um House Bill 349 also
 
04:08:45.550 --> 04:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
authorizes the board of registration and
 
04:08:47.950 --> 04:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
Optometry to adopt certification
 
04:08:50.149 --> 04:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
criteria so they will have they would
 
04:08:52.349 --> 04:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
require minimum education training and
 
04:08:55.070 --> 04:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
hands-on experience criteria for
 
04:08:57.950 --> 04:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
proctoring so that somebody of an
 
04:09:00.830 --> 04:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
optometrist isn't um just let loose on
 
04:09:02.950 --> 04:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
their own to practice they need to be
 
04:09:05.429 --> 04:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
trained with somebody following them and
 
04:09:08.109 --> 04:09:08.119 align:start position:0%
outcome reporting um requirements
 
04:09:10.109 --> 04:09:10.119 align:start position:0%
there's also a significant investment
 
04:09:12.149 --> 04:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
for these um machines a minimum of
 
04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
$75,000 I know our local optometrist
 
04:09:17.910 --> 04:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
said that they might cost a minimum of
 
04:09:21.149 --> 04:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
$100,000 So based on that it would be my
 
04:09:23.269 --> 04:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
personal assumption that no one was
 
04:09:25.109 --> 04:09:25.119 align:start position:0%
taking this investment
 
04:09:27.550 --> 04:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
lightly and they also I've also been
 
04:09:29.990 --> 04:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
told that this is primarily in order to
 
04:09:32.229 --> 04:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
be able to provide a service to their to
 
04:09:33.590 --> 04:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
their patients something that they have
 
04:09:33.600 --> 04:09:34.590 align:start position:0%
their patients something that they have
trouble

04:09:34.590 --> 04:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
04:09:38.269 --> 04:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
accessing um so in that in comes to the
 
04:09:40.670 --> 04:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
access to care rural areas face
 
04:09:43.630 --> 04:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
significant shortages of opthalmologists
 
04:09:45.950 --> 04:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
um and the number of opthalmologists is
 
04:09:45.960 --> 04:09:47.109 align:start position:0%
um and the number of opthalmologists is
also

04:09:47.109 --> 04:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:09:49.149 --> 04:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
declining however the number of
 
04:09:51.710 --> 04:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
optometrists is increasing and I happen
 
04:09:53.990 --> 04:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
to live in Carrol County where we have
 
04:09:57.429 --> 04:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
only one opthalmologist in the entire
 
04:09:59.990 --> 04:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
area and I have some letters from
 
04:10:01.790 --> 04:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
patients who've had to travel long
 
04:10:03.910 --> 04:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
distances in order to receive some of
 
04:10:06.990 --> 04:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
these therapies and I was given
 
04:10:09.710 --> 04:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
information that the closest um
 
04:10:12.950 --> 04:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist to my town is 30 minutes
 
04:10:16.269 --> 04:10:16.279 align:start position:0%
away but when I um put that into um
 
04:10:19.269 --> 04:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
Google Maps it's 43 minutes from my
 
04:10:20.790 --> 04:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
house and I happen to know that it's
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
over a lot of twisty windy roads that
 
04:10:26.510 --> 04:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
are difficult for people um who have
 
04:10:27.950 --> 04:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
trouble seeing especially if their
 
04:10:29.630 --> 04:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
appointment were in the evening which
 
04:10:32.429 --> 04:10:32.439 align:start position:0%
happens easily in the winter because
 
04:10:34.309 --> 04:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
4:00 comes pretty
 
04:10:36.670 --> 04:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
quickly um so you have to be really
 
04:10:38.510 --> 04:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
careful about when you're scheduling
 
04:10:40.149 --> 04:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
your your
 
04:10:42.830 --> 04:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
appointments um also average weight
 
04:10:44.469 --> 04:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
times for these procedures in an
 
04:10:47.950 --> 04:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist office range from um well
 
04:10:49.950 --> 04:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
3.6 to 4
 
04:10:53.030 --> 04:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
months um um patients undergoing eye
 
04:10:55.349 --> 04:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
procedures are often unable to drive to
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
or from their appointments which
 
04:10:58.910 --> 04:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
requires them to find someone to go with
 
04:11:01.389 --> 04:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
them taking up considerable time for a
 
04:11:03.590 --> 04:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
caregiver um this bill would reduce
 
04:11:06.269 --> 04:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
weight times and travel burdens for
 
04:11:09.269 --> 04:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
patients um patients in Southern New
 
04:11:11.830 --> 04:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Express similar concerns that
 
04:11:14.950 --> 04:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
current New Hampshire laws leads to Long
 
04:11:16.790 --> 04:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
waiting times and delayed treatment
 
04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
while they're waiting their quality of
 
04:11:21.630 --> 04:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
life suffers it's imagine if you have
 
04:11:24.109 --> 04:11:24.119 align:start position:0%
trouble seeing that impacts your quality
 
04:11:27.189 --> 04:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
of life um this also would reduce health
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
care costs because the increased
 
04:11:30.750 --> 04:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
availability of care typically leads to
 
04:11:33.229 --> 04:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
lower health care costs patients have
 
04:11:34.990 --> 04:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
more options they can choose where they
 
04:11:36.870 --> 04:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
want to be
 
04:11:40.109 --> 04:11:40.119 align:start position:0%
treated um as for some issues that might
 
04:11:42.550 --> 04:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
come up particularly patient safety
 
04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
there are 12 states that currently allow
 
04:11:47.750 --> 04:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
optometrist to perform these procedures
 
04:11:50.510 --> 04:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
um optometrist in Kentucky Oklahoma and
 
04:11:52.870 --> 04:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
Louisiana have safely performed these
 
04:11:55.309 --> 04:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
procedures for well over a decade and
 
04:11:57.870 --> 04:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma has allowed these procedures
 
04:11:57.880 --> 04:11:59.149 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma has allowed these procedures
since

04:11:59.149 --> 04:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
since
 
04:12:01.830 --> 04:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
1998 an evidence indicates Adverse
 
04:12:06.469 --> 04:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
Events in just two cases out of over
 
04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:13.550 --> 04:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
0.1% um but to as a comparison the
 
04:12:15.510 --> 04:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
average American's odds of dying in a
 
04:12:19.229 --> 04:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
car accident in any given year are 0
 
04:12:21.910 --> 04:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
one% so about 10 times higher than the
 
04:12:23.830 --> 04:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
odds of suffering adverse effects from
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
one of these procedures if performed by
 
04:12:25.680 --> 04:12:26.670 align:start position:0%
one of these procedures if performed by
an

04:12:26.670 --> 04:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:12:28.950 --> 04:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
optometrist so we don't actually know
 
04:12:30.950 --> 04:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
whether op opthalmologists have a
 
04:12:32.830 --> 04:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
similar rate of adverse effects with
 
04:12:35.229 --> 04:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
these procedures so we don't know if
 
04:12:37.630 --> 04:12:37.640 align:start position:0%
that's um potentially higher or lower
 
04:12:40.389 --> 04:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
than what optometrist experience we were
 
04:12:42.590 --> 04:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
unable to find data on that but
 
04:12:45.429 --> 04:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
presumably that number is not zero and
 
04:12:47.109 --> 04:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
it could very well be the same as the
 
04:12:48.750 --> 04:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
rate experienced by
 
04:12:51.309 --> 04:12:51.319 align:start position:0%
optometrists insurance carriers who
 
04:12:53.189 --> 04:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
specialize in medical malpractice
 
04:12:54.630 --> 04:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
meanwhile recognize that the
 
04:12:57.070 --> 04:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
quantifiable risk of expanded scope of
 
04:12:58.309 --> 04:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
practice is
 
04:13:00.349 --> 04:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
negligible this is reflected in
 
04:13:02.710 --> 04:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
virtually flat premiums for malpractice
 
04:13:04.550 --> 04:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
insurance for
 
04:13:07.149 --> 04:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
optometrists if this bill becomes law
 
04:13:08.910 --> 04:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
patient safety will be safeguarded by
 
04:13:11.109 --> 04:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
stringent certification processes
 
04:13:13.990 --> 04:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
established by the board though I urge
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
you to support House Bill 349 so that
 
04:13:18.870 --> 04:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents can have access
 
04:13:21.269 --> 04:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
to the care that they
 
04:13:23.790 --> 04:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
need thank you for the committee we have
 
04:13:26.109 --> 04:13:26.119 align:start position:0%
a large stack of professionals who are
 
04:13:29.149 --> 04:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
going to be speaking to us on this bill
 
04:13:31.070 --> 04:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
so please don't ask technical questions
 
04:13:32.030 --> 04:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:13:34.630 --> 04:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
representatives representative
 
04:13:37.189 --> 04:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:13:40.590 --> 04:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
for being here Katie so how soon do you
 
04:13:46.030 --> 04:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
think uh the this entire new uh area of
 
04:13:48.469 --> 04:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
practice could be available in the state
 
04:13:50.790 --> 04:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire oh that's a very good
 
04:13:53.590 --> 04:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
question well first we do have some
 
04:13:56.429 --> 04:13:56.439 align:start position:0%
optometrists who are trained but I don't
 
04:13:58.269 --> 04:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
know what process they would have to go
 
04:14:00.109 --> 04:14:00.119 align:start position:0%
through obviously we would have to this
 
04:14:02.510 --> 04:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
would have to go through rules so that's
 
04:14:05.309 --> 04:14:05.319 align:start position:0%
issue number one so that that's what six
 
04:14:07.790 --> 04:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
months minimum after the passage of a
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
bill usually typically um and then
 
04:14:13.109 --> 04:14:13.119 align:start position:0%
optometrist have to invest in the
 
04:14:14.469 --> 04:14:14.479 align:start position:0%
machines they have to be trained if
 
04:14:15.830 --> 04:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
they're not currently trained it could
 
04:14:18.630 --> 04:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
be a little while I'm sure a year or two
 
04:14:20.710 --> 04:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
at minimum I would imagine and that's
 
04:14:22.990 --> 04:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
I'm purely speculation on my part thank
 
04:14:25.030 --> 04:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
you representative Howard thank you for
 
04:14:28.349 --> 04:14:28.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh so just to clarify
 
04:14:30.269 --> 04:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
I mean you just said that some
 
04:14:32.910 --> 04:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
optometrists uh have the uh the the
 
04:14:35.269 --> 04:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
training to do this uh do they go
 
04:14:37.870 --> 04:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
through that training in school I
 
04:14:39.229 --> 04:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
actually don't know the answer to that
 
04:14:40.429 --> 04:14:40.439 align:start position:0%
question I'm sure some of the
 
04:14:42.590 --> 04:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
optometrist here would would be able to
 
04:14:44.070 --> 04:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
04:14:46.510 --> 04:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah other
 
04:14:49.550 --> 04:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
04:14:49.560 --> 04:15:01.710 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
representative

04:15:01.710 --> 04:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:04.030 --> 04:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you Madame chairwoman and
 
04:15:06.309 --> 04:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Alicia Greg I am lucky
 
04:15:09.030 --> 04:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
enough to represent NASA one of the 27
 
04:15:11.510 --> 04:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
from there I'm here to talk surprisingly
 
04:15:13.670 --> 04:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
about Optometry today besides having
 
04:15:15.149 --> 04:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
eyes I haven't always had a lot of
 
04:15:16.750 --> 04:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
experience in this besides when I had to
 
04:15:18.750 --> 04:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
go to the eye doctor myself and I find
 
04:15:20.590 --> 04:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
it fascinating that this is something in
 
04:15:23.630 --> 04:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
the legislature but it is I've had many
 
04:15:25.590 --> 04:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
constituents call me wanting to look at
 
04:15:27.189 --> 04:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
this particularly upset about what
 
04:15:28.830 --> 04:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
happened last year because of the lack
 
04:15:31.269 --> 04:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
of care one thing I can do is a lot of
 
04:15:33.510 --> 04:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
research so I started looking into it it
 
04:15:36.269 --> 04:15:36.279 align:start position:0%
was no surprise to me that this is not
 
04:15:37.950 --> 04:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
something unusual within the medical
 
04:15:40.830 --> 04:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
community I've had experience in this my
 
04:15:43.229 --> 04:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
late husband was a nurse and athetist
 
04:15:45.429 --> 04:15:45.439 align:start position:0%
the Dynamics that you find between
 
04:15:48.229 --> 04:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
anesthetist anesthesiologist and
 
04:15:51.790 --> 04:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
anesthesia texts is very very similar
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of parts in the medical
 
04:15:56.269 --> 04:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
community where you have multiple people
 
04:15:58.309 --> 04:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
doing different things and it can raise
 
04:16:00.750 --> 04:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
alarms so I looked at this to think well
 
04:16:02.309 --> 04:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
how how does this make difference
 
04:16:05.870 --> 04:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
because I do know that in when um I'm
 
04:16:07.750 --> 04:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
going to switch up the optomologist and
 
04:16:10.070 --> 04:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
optometrist here but optometrists when
 
04:16:11.229 --> 04:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
they go to school they're actually
 
04:16:12.910 --> 04:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
require required to have this train
 
04:16:14.990 --> 04:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
training what we are asking them to be
 
04:16:18.670 --> 04:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
able to do today in 349 is to be able to
 
04:16:20.309 --> 04:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
lasers that they're actually already
 
04:16:22.469 --> 04:16:22.479 align:start position:0%
trained to do it's required in their
 
04:16:24.070 --> 04:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
schooling this isn't something they take
 
04:16:26.109 --> 04:16:26.119 align:start position:0%
as an option it's part of their
 
04:16:27.950 --> 04:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
schooling so they're already they're
 
04:16:30.750 --> 04:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
already trained for that so you look at
 
04:16:33.510 --> 04:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
why why would we not let them do that
 
04:16:35.070 --> 04:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
well there's always a push and pull
 
04:16:37.149 --> 04:16:37.159 align:start position:0%
within the medical community I'm sure
 
04:16:38.510 --> 04:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
many of you at this point have seen a
 
04:16:40.389 --> 04:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner when nurse
 
04:16:42.910 --> 04:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
practitioners first began Physicians
 
04:16:44.790 --> 04:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
were all up in arm there were quite a
 
04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
few of them that testified that there
 
04:16:48.510 --> 04:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
would be a lack of care or that there
 
04:16:50.550 --> 04:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
would be more malpractice or patience
 
04:16:53.070 --> 04:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be as safe I fell into that I
 
04:16:54.510 --> 04:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
thought you know what if I'm paying the
 
04:16:56.229 --> 04:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
same co-pay or the same amount I'd
 
04:16:58.590 --> 04:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
rather see a physician that was until
 
04:17:00.269 --> 04:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
one time I needed to get into a doctor
 
04:17:02.389 --> 04:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
and I had a six-month waiting period but
 
04:17:04.109 --> 04:17:04.119 align:start position:0%
I could get into the nurse practitioner
 
04:17:07.149 --> 04:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
the next day and it's amazing I now have
 
04:17:09.710 --> 04:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
a primary nurse practitioner because I
 
04:17:11.349 --> 04:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
have that confidence they do have the
 
04:17:13.550 --> 04:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
training to be able to do that I don't
 
04:17:16.229 --> 04:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
find this any different they're already
 
04:17:19.349 --> 04:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
trained to do this it's there however
 
04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
there is a push of news propaganda
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
whatever else saying that this could be
 
04:17:27.990 --> 04:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
dangerous a lot of Scare Tactics also
 
04:17:30.670 --> 04:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
not unusual when you find one medical
 
04:17:33.590 --> 04:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
Branch or one specialty starting to
 
04:17:36.030 --> 04:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
Branch out into more things um
 
04:17:37.910 --> 04:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
anesthesia was the same way Believe It
 
04:17:39.630 --> 04:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
or Not nurs anesthetists were around
 
04:17:39.640 --> 04:17:41.109 align:start position:0%
or Not nurs anesthetists were around
before

04:17:41.109 --> 04:17:41.119 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:17:43.710 --> 04:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologists and anesthesiologist
 
04:17:45.309 --> 04:17:45.319 align:start position:0%
figured out oh there's a lot of money in
 
04:17:46.590 --> 04:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
that and they took it back and then when
 
04:17:49.109 --> 04:17:49.119 align:start position:0%
a nurse and athetist started performing
 
04:17:51.229 --> 04:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
again because it was more costeffective
 
04:17:53.469 --> 04:17:53.479 align:start position:0%
you add another push and pull now
 
04:17:55.030 --> 04:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
Dynamics are not something that we
 
04:17:57.109 --> 04:17:57.119 align:start position:0%
handle here that's for them to figure
 
04:17:59.950 --> 04:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
out what we handle is our constituents
 
04:18:02.229 --> 04:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
we know that the the number of
 
04:18:05.149 --> 04:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists are declining we know
 
04:18:06.870 --> 04:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
and I can tell by everybody that has
 
04:18:08.990 --> 04:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
glasses in here that the number of
 
04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
patients is not declining so then we
 
04:18:13.030 --> 04:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
have to look at what's best for our
 
04:18:15.189 --> 04:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
constituents I went back and I looked
 
04:18:17.229 --> 04:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
not at news reports or anything else but
 
04:18:19.670 --> 04:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
at hard facts within the legal system
 
04:18:22.469 --> 04:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
about what does it look like for
 
04:18:24.309 --> 04:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
malpractice suits because there are
 
04:18:26.830 --> 04:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
places um like my colleague just said
 
04:18:28.590 --> 04:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
talked about that they have been
 
04:18:30.349 --> 04:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
performing these particular procedures
 
04:18:32.269 --> 04:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to say has malpractice gone
 
04:18:34.830 --> 04:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
up in these in these states the answer
 
04:18:37.109 --> 04:18:37.119 align:start position:0%
is no it actually hasn't gone up at all
 
04:18:39.149 --> 04:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact then I looked at
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
well what is the malpractice because
 
04:18:42.790 --> 04:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
maybe there's more malpractice for these
 
04:18:45.429 --> 04:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
jections versus normal things no that
 
04:18:47.830 --> 04:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
hasn't changed either the most common
 
04:18:50.070 --> 04:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
malpractice for opthalmologists and
 
04:18:52.950 --> 04:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
optometrist both is lack of
 
04:18:55.389 --> 04:18:55.399 align:start position:0%
diagnosis so this is something that we
 
04:18:57.189 --> 04:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
can provide to our
 
04:18:59.590 --> 04:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
constituency the ability to have care
 
04:19:01.149 --> 04:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
just like you can go see a nurse
 
04:19:02.550 --> 04:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
practitioner if you don't want to wait
 
04:19:04.710 --> 04:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
six months to get in a doctor and I'll
 
04:19:07.189 --> 04:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
tell you one time I had an ulcer in the
 
04:19:09.790 --> 04:19:09.800 align:start position:0%
middle of my cornea and there is nothing
 
04:19:11.910 --> 04:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
more painful I'm pretty sure on Earth so
 
04:19:13.670 --> 04:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
I know how sens ensi we are about our
 
04:19:15.870 --> 04:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
eyes and you need to get into somebody
 
04:19:17.389 --> 04:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
right away we're talking about
 
04:19:19.910 --> 04:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
injections that do glaucoma care every
 
04:19:21.469 --> 04:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
one of these injections you look up it
 
04:19:24.590 --> 04:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
says minimally invasive and this is once
 
04:19:27.469 --> 04:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
again training they have but the bonus
 
04:19:30.870 --> 04:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
is just like I had a choice on whether
 
04:19:32.149 --> 04:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
one or not I wanted to wait for a
 
04:19:34.710 --> 04:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
physician or go to a nurse practitioner
 
04:19:37.189 --> 04:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
both trained very well in the field I
 
04:19:38.149 --> 04:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
had a
 
04:19:40.630 --> 04:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
choice and our constituents if they
 
04:19:42.429 --> 04:19:42.439 align:start position:0%
don't feel safe going to optometrist
 
04:19:44.710 --> 04:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
Maybe they're not there yet they're okay
 
04:19:46.990 --> 04:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
waiting they still can go see that
 
04:19:48.990 --> 04:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist but I think it's high
 
04:19:51.189 --> 04:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
time that the legislature allows
 
04:19:54.510 --> 04:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
optometrists to a serve our constituency
 
04:19:56.269 --> 04:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
and B do what they're already trained
 
04:19:58.189 --> 04:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
for so I ask that you take this into
 
04:20:00.550 --> 04:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
serious consideration and please pass
 
04:20:02.830 --> 04:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 349 thank
 
04:20:06.630 --> 04:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
you any questions represent sitech yes
 
04:20:08.710 --> 04:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned several states that are
 
04:20:11.349 --> 04:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
already authorized this yes Oklahoma
 
04:20:14.429 --> 04:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
started way back uh how about uh
 
04:20:16.269 --> 04:20:16.279 align:start position:0%
neighboring states New York
 
04:20:18.670 --> 04:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Rhode Island do any of
 
04:20:21.189 --> 04:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
these states permit this process well I
 
04:20:23.309 --> 04:20:23.319 align:start position:0%
don't have the States written down so I
 
04:20:24.910 --> 04:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
don't know about any of our neighboring
 
04:20:26.429 --> 04:20:26.439 align:start position:0%
I never really worry about that too much
 
04:20:27.670 --> 04:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
because in New Hampshire we like to do
 
04:20:29.830 --> 04:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
it our own way so I make sure that we
 
04:20:31.389 --> 04:20:31.399 align:start position:0%
kind of stay true to that but I did not
 
04:20:33.229 --> 04:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
look that up thank you for the
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
question other
 
04:20:37.870 --> 04:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
questions president Howard thank you for
 
04:20:39.790 --> 04:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I understand that
 
04:20:43.269 --> 04:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
you've talked a lot about the uh autom
 
04:20:45.590 --> 04:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
training and I was just wondering if you
 
04:20:48.189 --> 04:20:48.199 align:start position:0%
knew the difference between uh how much
 
04:20:50.030 --> 04:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
training the opthalmologists receive
 
04:20:51.349 --> 04:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
versus the
 
04:20:53.229 --> 04:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
optometrists um I think there's more
 
04:20:56.550 --> 04:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
people that can speak closer to that but
 
04:20:58.429 --> 04:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm GNA you know I'm going to
 
04:21:00.269 --> 04:21:00.279 align:start position:0%
leave that for the experts I can say
 
04:21:01.830 --> 04:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
that I know certainly in anesthesia and
 
04:21:03.070 --> 04:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
other things like that I have a much
 
04:21:05.109 --> 04:21:05.119 align:start position:0%
more close relationship but I think that
 
04:21:06.590 --> 04:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
they can explain that pretty well but I
 
04:21:07.790 --> 04:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable with our level of
 
04:21:09.550 --> 04:21:09.560 align:start position:0%
training yes no worries thank you thank
 
04:21:12.590 --> 04:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
you other questions thank you very much
 
04:21:14.990 --> 04:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
repres thank you so much representative
 
04:21:15.000 --> 04:21:25.750 align:start position:0%
repres thank you so much representative
Mark

04:21:25.750 --> 04:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:27.950 --> 04:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam chair and
 
04:21:30.750 --> 04:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I have written
 
04:21:32.790 --> 04:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
testimony which I won't read I would
 
04:21:35.109 --> 04:21:35.119 align:start position:0%
like to summarize it in the interest of
 
04:21:37.830 --> 04:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
time my name is Mark Pearson I am the
 
04:21:40.510 --> 04:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
chairman of the children and family law
 
04:21:42.990 --> 04:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
committee however I spent several years
 
04:21:44.710 --> 04:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
in the Health and Human Services
 
04:21:46.630 --> 04:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
Committee of the house the last two is
 
04:21:49.269 --> 04:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
Chairman and since 2020 I've chaired the
 
04:21:51.389 --> 04:21:51.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:21:53.870 --> 04:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
oversight committee there were several
 
04:21:56.950 --> 04:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
medical people in my family including my
 
04:21:58.710 --> 04:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
wife who is a
 
04:22:01.870 --> 04:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
physician I have four points to make
 
04:22:04.189 --> 04:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
number one when my wife started her
 
04:22:07.550 --> 04:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
medical practice 30 years ago she had to
 
04:22:09.670 --> 04:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
send a lot of people to
 
04:22:13.189 --> 04:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
Boston since then special ists have been
 
04:22:15.269 --> 04:22:15.279 align:start position:0%
moving up and doing one or two days a
 
04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
week in Andover Mass havil Mass even
 
04:22:20.550 --> 04:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
plast down to Hampshire last year and
 
04:22:22.349 --> 04:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
even today it was said that there are
 
04:22:22.359 --> 04:22:23.950 align:start position:0%
even today it was said that there are
orological

04:22:23.950 --> 04:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
orological
 
04:22:26.510 --> 04:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
deserts so when this bill was tabled
 
04:22:29.710 --> 04:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
last year I went to an oologist and I
 
04:22:32.590 --> 04:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
said what do you think about citing your
 
04:22:35.790 --> 04:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
people in those deserts I hope that
 
04:22:38.109 --> 04:22:38.119 align:start position:0%
somebody has brought the testimony I
 
04:22:41.510 --> 04:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
have seen letters of intent that these
 
04:22:43.590 --> 04:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
deserts are being being addressed it
 
04:22:46.670 --> 04:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
will take much less time to go get a
 
04:22:46.680 --> 04:22:47.910 align:start position:0%
will take much less time to go get a
full

04:22:47.910 --> 04:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
full
 
04:22:50.710 --> 04:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist to work with
 
04:22:54.109 --> 04:22:54.119 align:start position:0%
you secondly I Champion the lowering or
 
04:22:56.830 --> 04:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
elimination of needless
 
04:22:59.950 --> 04:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
regulations what was it we saw 2,000
 
04:23:02.590 --> 04:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
hours of training before you could braid
 
04:23:05.590 --> 04:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
somebody's hair for money I mean
 
04:23:09.710 --> 04:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
really I also Champion the widening of
 
04:23:12.030 --> 04:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
scope of practice I was very much behind
 
04:23:13.469 --> 04:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:23:15.950 --> 04:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
that would train LPNs to the level of
 
04:23:19.030 --> 04:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
being Med nurses and my Aunt Janet was
 
04:23:21.149 --> 04:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
one of the first RN in the United States
 
04:23:24.349 --> 04:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
to become a nurse practitioner so I'm
 
04:23:27.950 --> 04:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
all in favor of that as long as the
 
04:23:31.790 --> 04:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
training is there the supervision is
 
04:23:33.910 --> 04:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
there we've got people who will answer
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
the speculation about what do
 
04:23:40.710 --> 04:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
optometrists get in their school versus
 
04:23:43.750 --> 04:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists and remember
 
04:23:46.590 --> 04:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
a nurse practitioner isn't a doctor and
 
04:23:51.710 --> 04:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
an optometrist isn't an MD or a do third
 
04:23:54.550 --> 04:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
my experience I need an injection into
 
04:23:57.670 --> 04:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
my left eye every eight weeks I had an
 
04:24:00.189 --> 04:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
excellent oologist in havil Mass until
 
04:24:02.910 --> 04:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
he retired now he could have done that
 
04:24:04.550 --> 04:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
procedure he was
 
04:24:09.109 --> 04:24:09.119 align:start position:0%
trained as a MD opthalmologist with
 
04:24:11.790 --> 04:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
extensive postmed school training he
 
04:24:13.389 --> 04:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
could have done it
 
04:24:15.830 --> 04:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
but he brought in somebody even further
 
04:24:18.910 --> 04:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
trained on this particular thing now if
 
04:24:22.189 --> 04:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
my opthamologist would want to go up the
 
04:24:24.349 --> 04:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
level I'm not sure I would want to
 
04:24:27.269 --> 04:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
entrust my eyes to somebody who does
 
04:24:30.550 --> 04:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
good work in their Lane but is still not
 
04:24:34.030 --> 04:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
an MD not a doo not an
 
04:24:36.910 --> 04:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist and then last citations
 
04:24:39.670 --> 04:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
before boards I read last year's
 
04:24:42.030 --> 04:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and it was asserted that the
 
04:24:43.870 --> 04:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
just isn't
 
04:24:46.389 --> 04:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
complaints do you remember Dr barbano
 
04:24:49.590 --> 04:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
from Catholic Medical Center the
 
04:24:51.870 --> 04:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Board of
 
04:24:56.510 --> 04:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
Medicine cited 21 malpractice complaints
 
04:24:58.990 --> 04:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
against him the New Hampshire board
 
04:24:59.000 --> 04:25:00.469 align:start position:0%
against him the New Hampshire board
cited

04:25:00.469 --> 04:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
cited
 
04:25:05.670 --> 04:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
zero so cheering oversight as I do I
 
04:25:07.550 --> 04:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
formed a subcomittee we wanted to look
 
04:25:09.830 --> 04:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
at why was this is the New Hampshire
 
04:25:12.710 --> 04:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
board derelict what we discovered is
 
04:25:15.229 --> 04:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
different states have different criteria
 
04:25:19.189 --> 04:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
for what they report but if I went to
 
04:25:22.790 --> 04:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
CMC to have surgery and only relied on
 
04:25:25.269 --> 04:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire board's statements I
 
04:25:27.910 --> 04:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
would assume there's no problem here we
 
04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
found out that wasn't the case so in
 
04:25:36.349 --> 04:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
conclusion it will be increasingly less
 
04:25:39.309 --> 04:25:39.319 align:start position:0%
a distance to get an opthalmologist as
 
04:25:41.910 --> 04:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
they continue to figure out how to site
 
04:25:44.109 --> 04:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
people in the
 
04:25:44.119 --> 04:25:46.670 align:start position:0%
people in the
deserts

04:25:46.670 --> 04:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
deserts
 
04:25:49.269 --> 04:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
also I think it's very important to
 
04:25:51.269 --> 04:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
understand what the true level of
 
04:25:54.269 --> 04:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
training is how many hours of training
 
04:25:57.109 --> 04:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
and supervised training in an
 
04:25:59.429 --> 04:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist versus an optometrist
 
04:26:01.630 --> 04:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
this is not to put people down I have a
 
04:26:04.630 --> 04:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner on my staff helping
 
04:26:08.309 --> 04:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
our physicians it is to say that on
 
04:26:10.870 --> 04:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
certain procedures we really do want to
 
04:26:14.269 --> 04:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
be careful our health is on the line so
 
04:26:16.990 --> 04:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I do have
 
04:26:21.830 --> 04:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
written testimony I will give over thank
 
04:26:25.070 --> 04:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
you questions thank you very much oh
 
04:26:27.189 --> 04:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
excuse me represent sers has a question
 
04:26:28.469 --> 04:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just want to
 
04:26:31.950 --> 04:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm clear support or
 
04:26:34.269 --> 04:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
oppose I'm very much in support of
 
04:26:36.750 --> 04:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
optometrist but not supporting what they
 
04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
seek to do here so I would be
 
04:26:42.229 --> 04:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
opposed representative Howard would
 
04:26:45.070 --> 04:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
would you be in support of uh helping
 
04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
increase the educational opportunities
 
04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
for optometrist so that they could
 
04:26:51.189 --> 04:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
potentially maybe perform these or is
 
04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
that going to be too
 
04:26:56.349 --> 04:26:56.359 align:start position:0%
much if the level of training were
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
brought to the level that
 
04:27:00.990 --> 04:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists presently have yeah
 
04:27:03.070 --> 04:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
that's why I was very much supporting
 
04:27:08.070 --> 04:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
LPNs being Med nurses if and my aunt
 
04:27:10.149 --> 04:27:10.159 align:start position:0%

of that in
 
04:30:43.189 --> 04:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
detail the courses as well as laboratory
 
04:30:45.790 --> 04:30:45.800 align:start position:0%
and clinical practice on real patients
 
04:30:48.870 --> 04:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
is described furthermore I'm a longtime

in this role I've worked over the past
 
04:31:16.790 --> 04:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
several years to ensure accreditation
 
04:31:18.710 --> 04:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
standards have a minimum competency
 
04:31:21.389 --> 04:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
reporting system that includes Surgical
 
04:31:24.550 --> 04:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
and Laser procedures I'm including the

specific La language and
 
04:31:29.950 --> 04:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
resolutions uh from the AO acoe that
 
04:31:32.950 --> 04:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
confirms that all colleges teach modern
 
04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
procedures like those included in the
 
04:31:37.630 --> 04:31:37.640 align:start position:0%
bill please see also the letter from the
 
04:31:40.429 --> 04:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
chair of acoe Dr Tim Patito in this
 
04:31:42.990 --> 04:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
regard furthermore I've served as an

to assure you there is nothing in House
Bill

04:31:52.389 --> 04:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:31:54.870 --> 04:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
349 that is not included in the
 
04:31:56.830 --> 04:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
curricula for all graduating Doctors of
 
04:31:58.870 --> 04:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
Optometry despite what you will hear in
 
04:32:01.830 --> 04:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
testimony here just to be really clear
 
04:32:04.710 --> 04:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
more importantly I'm here to
 
04:32:07.750 --> 04:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
confirm uh excuse me that we
 
04:32:10.229 --> 04:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
continuously improve and upgrade
 
04:32:12.469 --> 04:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
standards to match
 
04:32:14.790 --> 04:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
new treatments as they arise the
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
treatments that were available and that
 
04:32:19.630 --> 04:32:19.640 align:start position:0%
I did 29 years ago when I first became a
 
04:32:21.429 --> 04:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
new doctor are not the same as what we
 
04:32:24.670 --> 04:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
have now things change procedures change
 
04:32:26.830 --> 04:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh research changes furthermore
 
04:32:28.389 --> 04:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
legislators in both New Hampshire and
 
04:32:30.030 --> 04:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
Vermont have asked me to provide an
 
04:32:32.070 --> 04:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
analysis of the curricula at Medical and
 
04:32:34.349 --> 04:32:34.359 align:start position:0%
Optometry schools and training programs
 
04:32:36.189 --> 04:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
and I am here to unmistakable
 
04:32:38.229 --> 04:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
unmistakably repeat respective
 
04:32:39.950 --> 04:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
equivalencies and we'll provide you with
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
that analysis as well please remember
 
04:32:45.109 --> 04:32:45.119 align:start position:0%
that specialty clinical training occurs
 
04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
years earlier in optometry school
 
04:32:49.790 --> 04:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
relative to the eye and Associated
 
04:32:51.389 --> 04:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
disease and includes a human body
 
04:32:53.550 --> 04:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
systems approach that results in
 
04:32:55.510 --> 04:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
competency in the treatment of the eyes
 
04:32:58.269 --> 04:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
and related diseases upon graduation
 
04:33:01.630 --> 04:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
very similar to
 
04:33:03.910 --> 04:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
Dentistry this is why my colleagues in
 
04:33:06.230 --> 04:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology must complete a residency
 
04:33:07.590 --> 04:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
because they have very little training
 
04:33:10.310 --> 04:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
in eye disease prior to Medical School
 
04:33:12.789 --> 04:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
Graduation I test Tes ified in front of
 
04:33:15.429 --> 04:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
this body many times as I said over 29
 
04:33:17.910 --> 04:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
years regarding the scope of practice of
 
04:33:19.949 --> 04:33:19.959 align:start position:0%
Optometry because New Hampshire laws
 
04:33:23.390 --> 04:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
were outdated and continue to remain so
 
04:33:24.869 --> 04:33:24.879 align:start position:0%
because we have to come back to this
 
04:33:26.470 --> 04:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
body on a regular
 
04:33:30.349 --> 04:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
basis um when new devices drugs or
 
04:33:33.470 --> 04:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
procedures um become
 
04:33:36.310 --> 04:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
available when I first testified years
 
04:33:39.390 --> 04:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
ago I was a new doctor working under
 
04:33:42.390 --> 04:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
Federal jurisdiction at the VA
 
04:33:44.629 --> 04:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
I was practicing as I was trained at the
 
04:33:47.269 --> 04:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
New England College of Optometry which
 
04:33:49.230 --> 04:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
included rotations that were not in
 
04:33:50.590 --> 04:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because you're going to
 
04:33:52.750 --> 04:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
hear that the school in Boston can't
 
04:33:54.269 --> 04:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
possibly train people in advanced
 
04:33:55.830 --> 04:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
procedures because they don't do that in
 
04:33:57.230 --> 04:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts well that's not true we
 
04:33:59.709 --> 04:33:59.719 align:start position:0%
send people to the federal system and we
 
04:34:02.230 --> 04:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
send students elsewhere because they
 
04:34:04.150 --> 04:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
also have outdated laws in fact they're
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
one of the the least scope of practice
 
04:34:11.189 --> 04:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh areas so as I said um I was
 
04:34:12.910 --> 04:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
practicing as I was trained I was able
 
04:34:15.269 --> 04:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
to prescribe medications any medications
 
04:34:17.670 --> 04:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
needed for to care for the full spectrum
 
04:34:20.709 --> 04:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
of eye diseases I was performing minor
 
04:34:22.830 --> 04:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
surgical procedures and I was laser
 
04:34:25.070 --> 04:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
certified as I stated before and
 
04:34:27.789 --> 04:34:27.799 align:start position:0%
continued to do so at the VA however
 
04:34:29.429 --> 04:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
when I occasionally moonlighted in
 
04:34:31.750 --> 04:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
private practice my hands were often
 
04:34:33.949 --> 04:34:33.959 align:start position:0%
tied uh because of restricted and
 
04:34:35.990 --> 04:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
outdated New Hampshire law I was
 
04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
dismayed that despite my uh expertise I
 
04:34:42.230 --> 04:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
was not able to practice similarly the
 
04:34:44.470 --> 04:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
moment I stepped off Federal
 
04:34:48.349 --> 04:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
property um I was equally disturbed by
 
04:34:51.109 --> 04:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
the implication that the VA had this all
 
04:34:54.230 --> 04:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
wrong I am the daughter of a career Army
 
04:34:56.789 --> 04:34:56.799 align:start position:0%
veteran who served three tours in
 
04:34:58.949 --> 04:34:58.959 align:start position:0%
Vietnam I'm the wife of a career Air
 
04:35:00.750 --> 04:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
Force veteran and my middle son just
 
04:35:02.590 --> 04:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
completed seven years in Army
 
04:35:04.910 --> 04:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
intelligence I can assure you that if I
 
04:35:07.150 --> 04:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
thought the VA was wrong in their repeat
 
04:35:09.230 --> 04:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
supposition and directives mandating
 
04:35:11.150 --> 04:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
that all doctors practice at their
 
04:35:13.429 --> 04:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
highest level I would be the first to
 
04:35:15.830 --> 04:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
speak loudly in
 
04:35:18.390 --> 04:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
opposition contrarily the VA and the US
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:35:22.070 --> 04:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
have long recognized that Doctors of
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
Optometry are highly competent
 
04:35:26.109 --> 04:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
well-trained independently licensed
 
04:35:28.510 --> 04:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
Physicians and provide a much needed
 
04:35:32.029 --> 04:35:32.039 align:start position:0%
core service to our nation's finest I
 
04:35:34.109 --> 04:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
affirm that they do not have this wrong
 
04:35:36.109 --> 04:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
and have demanded that providers keep up
 
04:35:38.310 --> 04:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
with medical advancements changes in the
 
04:35:41.029 --> 04:35:41.039 align:start position:0%
medical Workforce and new scientific
 
04:35:41.039 --> 04:35:42.429 align:start position:0%
medical Workforce and new scientific
discovery

04:35:42.429 --> 04:35:42.439 align:start position:0%
discovery
 
04:35:44.949 --> 04:35:44.959 align:start position:0%
these facts also make me very
 
04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
comfortable returning to this
 
04:35:50.189 --> 04:35:50.199 align:start position:0%
body to further attest that fact the
 
04:35:52.029 --> 04:35:52.039 align:start position:0%
fact that Doctors of Optometry are
 
04:35:53.629 --> 04:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
highly highly trained in the care of the
 
04:35:55.949 --> 04:35:55.959 align:start position:0%
human body to include the visual system
 
04:35:58.269 --> 04:35:58.279 align:start position:0%
and keeping Pace with modern tools and
 
04:35:59.910 --> 04:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
to once again highlight that New
 
04:36:03.109 --> 04:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire continues to lag behind the
 
04:36:05.910 --> 04:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
data continues to show that Doctors of
 
04:36:07.830 --> 04:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
Optometry who perform the procedures
 
04:36:10.230 --> 04:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
included in this bill not some of the
 
04:36:11.869 --> 04:36:11.879 align:start position:0%
procedures that you've already heard
 
04:36:13.189 --> 04:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
that were referenced cuz we're not
 
04:36:14.629 --> 04:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
asking for some of the ones that were
 
04:36:18.750 --> 04:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
referenced already just to be clear um
 
04:36:21.150 --> 04:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
do so with an exceptionally low rate of
 
04:36:23.349 --> 04:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
significant or other Adverse Events
 
04:36:25.949 --> 04:36:25.959 align:start position:0%
across hundreds of thousands of
 
04:36:28.029 --> 04:36:28.039 align:start position:0%
procedures and you will have that data
 
04:36:30.949 --> 04:36:30.959 align:start position:0%
in front of you as well I'm also here to
 
04:36:32.990 --> 04:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
inform you that despite opposition from
 
04:36:35.029 --> 04:36:35.039 align:start position:0%
the medical society scope of practice
 
04:36:36.830 --> 04:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
laws were passed in New Hampshire and
 
04:36:39.070 --> 04:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
across the country and thousands of
 
04:36:40.670 --> 04:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
patients have been well served now for
 
04:36:42.070 --> 04:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
almost three decades
 
04:36:44.429 --> 04:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
and I've been a direct witness to your
 
04:36:48.070 --> 04:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
good work in this regard um patients
 
04:36:50.269 --> 04:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
have not been harmed and we continue to
 
04:36:52.709 --> 04:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
improve access and provide good care
 
04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
malpractice rates and Adverse Events
 
04:36:56.910 --> 04:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
outcomes Remain the lowest across many
 
04:37:01.390 --> 04:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:03.789 --> 04:37:03.799 align:start position:0%
Specialties I think it's unfair and
 
04:37:05.670 --> 04:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
inefficient to ask the New Hampshire
 
04:37:08.349 --> 04:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
legislature to try to keep Pace with all
 
04:37:11.590 --> 04:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
medical advancements but uh here we are
 
04:37:13.590 --> 04:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
and hope you will move this bill uh
 
04:37:16.189 --> 04:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
forward I would respectfully underscore
 
04:37:19.629 --> 04:37:19.639 align:start position:0%
that no medical profession stands still
 
04:37:21.910 --> 04:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
there is no Monopoly on
 
04:37:25.189 --> 04:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge and Optometry has a solid
 
04:37:27.709 --> 04:37:27.719 align:start position:0%
national board certification system
 
04:37:30.189 --> 04:37:30.199 align:start position:0%
uniform training a strong independent
 
04:37:32.670 --> 04:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
accreditation agency and a state lenser
 
04:37:36.429 --> 04:37:36.439 align:start position:0%
system designed to protect the public um
 
04:37:39.230 --> 04:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
today we're asking that you work in the
 
04:37:40.709 --> 04:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
spirit of New Hampshire's effort to
 
04:37:43.390 --> 04:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
attract the best and brightest doctors
 
04:37:46.390 --> 04:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
to our state we must be able to compete
 
04:37:48.310 --> 04:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
knowing that there's a broad doctor
 
04:37:50.429 --> 04:37:50.439 align:start position:0%
shortage in the country that is not
 
04:37:52.429 --> 04:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
going to change it's going to get worse
 
04:37:55.269 --> 04:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
before it gets better also important is
 
04:37:56.910 --> 04:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
the difficulty that we have recruiting
 
04:38:00.230 --> 04:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
new talented doctors I had to work for
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
five years to find a doctor to join my
 
04:38:04.269 --> 04:38:04.279 align:start position:0%
private practice I was very lucky to
 
04:38:06.470 --> 04:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
find Dr Jessica
 
04:38:08.830 --> 04:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
Eid however as she outlines in the
 
04:38:12.910 --> 04:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
letter which I will also provide copy of
 
04:38:15.590 --> 04:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
um and including with my testimony she
 
04:38:17.629 --> 04:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
was trained in a variety of laser and
 
04:38:19.349 --> 04:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
other procedures and continued to
 
04:38:21.189 --> 04:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
perform those procedures in the first
 
04:38:23.750 --> 04:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
years of practice when she moved to New
 
04:38:25.510 --> 04:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that her husband could
 
04:38:27.750 --> 04:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
complete his res residency in fellowship
 
04:38:30.189 --> 04:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth she could no longer use her
 
04:38:31.869 --> 04:38:31.879 align:start position:0%
skills to treat patients as she was
 
04:38:34.470 --> 04:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
trained she clearly states in her letter
 
04:38:36.150 --> 04:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
that she would never have chosen New
 
04:38:38.189 --> 04:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a place to practice and
 
04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
knew that she would be sacrificing her
 
04:38:42.109 --> 04:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
career goals so her husband could
 
04:38:44.750 --> 04:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
complete his training more importantly
 
04:38:46.709 --> 04:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
it's likely she will not stay here
 
04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
because of the current scope this is
 
04:38:51.789 --> 04:38:51.799 align:start position:0%
just one example of how the lack of
 
04:38:53.709 --> 04:38:53.719 align:start position:0%
modernization of our Practice Act is
 
04:38:56.109 --> 04:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
doing harm to New Hampshire citizens by
 
04:38:57.429 --> 04:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
preventing the best and brightest
 
04:38:59.070 --> 04:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
doctors from coming to our beautiful
 
04:39:01.910 --> 04:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
state finally I'm happy to act as a
 
04:39:03.869 --> 04:39:03.879 align:start position:0%
resource to this body and anyone else
 
04:39:05.949 --> 04:39:05.959 align:start position:0%
who without conflict of interest Works
 
04:39:08.310 --> 04:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
toward my own practice Mission which is
 
04:39:10.830 --> 04:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
to prevent vision loss and blindness and
 
04:39:12.029 --> 04:39:12.039 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your time and
 
04:39:14.310 --> 04:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
consideration and I'm happy to answer
 
04:39:16.310 --> 04:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
questions but I am providing a pretty
 
04:39:18.230 --> 04:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
detailed packet for your review with a
 
04:39:19.709 --> 04:39:19.719 align:start position:0%
lot of data and
 
04:39:21.869 --> 04:39:21.879 align:start position:0%
curriculum thank you thank you represent
 
04:39:24.470 --> 04:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
leam uh thank you madam chairman um
 
04:39:26.470 --> 04:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor for being here could
 
04:39:29.551 --> 04:39:29.561 align:start position:0%
you let us know um how many how many
 
04:39:30.949 --> 04:39:30.959 align:start position:0%
times that somebody who's going through
 
04:39:33.269 --> 04:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
training in school for Optometry is
 
04:39:35.990 --> 04:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
performing these laser procedures on a
 
04:39:38.270 --> 04:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
person yeah so that's a really good
 
04:39:40.510 --> 04:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
question and so it depends on their
 
04:39:42.948 --> 04:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
specialty right as it does with
 
04:39:45.310 --> 04:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology if you're a pediatric
 
04:39:47.310 --> 04:39:47.320 align:start position:0%
specialist you're probably going to do
 
04:39:50.110 --> 04:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
only the minimum right and so we have
 
04:39:52.190 --> 04:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
some described minimums in the
 
04:39:55.670 --> 04:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum there's some variation um
 
04:39:57.670 --> 04:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
that is tracked according to whatever
 
04:39:59.110 --> 04:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
the outcomes are that we're trying to
 
04:40:00.830 --> 04:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
achieve in a particular residency and I
 
04:40:03.830 --> 04:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
know that's a messy answer um we have
 
04:40:06.470 --> 04:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
some minimums that I can give you um
 
04:40:08.628 --> 04:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
after the hearing that sort of lay
 
04:40:10.948 --> 04:40:10.958 align:start position:0%
everything out but there are minimums
 
04:40:12.830 --> 04:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
you have have to be supervised you have
 
04:40:15.510 --> 04:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
to be supervised on live patients even
 
04:40:17.470 --> 04:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
before that you have to be supervised in
 
04:40:19.390 --> 04:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
the lab and you have to go through a
 
04:40:21.190 --> 04:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
minimum classroom training in fact I
 
04:40:23.430 --> 04:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
think our training program is more
 
04:40:25.510 --> 04:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
detailed quite frankly than what it is
 
04:40:28.150 --> 04:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
in a in a typical surgical residency
 
04:40:30.350 --> 04:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
followup um as a followup on the
 
04:40:32.150 --> 04:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
Pediatric would that be something you
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
can count on my hands or the hands on
 
04:40:35.910 --> 04:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
the committee just to get a depends on
 
04:40:38.990 --> 04:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
the procedures so for example you know
 
04:40:40.868 --> 04:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
if it's a very so the let me back up and
 
04:40:43.750 --> 04:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
say the three procedures in the bill are
 
04:40:43.760 --> 04:40:44.990 align:start position:0%
say the three procedures in the bill are
very

04:40:44.990 --> 04:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:40:47.990 --> 04:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
lowrisk relatively right everything is
 
04:40:52.788 --> 04:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
relative safe um procedures we know that
 
04:40:57.110 --> 04:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
the rate of complications is low already
 
04:40:59.670 --> 04:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
and so for those it's going to be a low
 
04:41:01.910 --> 04:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
number so maybe it's going to be 10
 
04:41:04.670 --> 04:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
procedures for example for a peripheral
 
04:41:07.270 --> 04:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
iridotomy which is one of the procedures
 
04:41:09.590 --> 04:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
as an example but it it does vary by
 
04:41:12.150 --> 04:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
procedure thank you that helps
 
04:41:12.160 --> 04:41:13.430 align:start position:0%
procedure thank you that helps
representative

04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:41:17.350 --> 04:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you madam chair uh these L
 
04:41:20.190 --> 04:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
laser equipment uh do they have
 
04:41:22.990 --> 04:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
safeguards built in and how can you can
 
04:41:25.910 --> 04:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
kind of describe and how they are yeah
 
04:41:28.390 --> 04:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
they're laser that you want to use if
 
04:41:31.150 --> 04:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
you accidentally press a button to
 
04:41:32.750 --> 04:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
switch it to another laser for example
 
04:41:34.310 --> 04:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of combination lasers
 
04:41:35.670 --> 04:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
that you use on different parts of the
 
04:41:37.230 --> 04:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
eye or different layers if you will of
 
04:41:39.990 --> 04:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
the eye um there are protocols that are
 
04:41:41.910 --> 04:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
preset that prevent you from making a
 
04:41:44.430 --> 04:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
mistake so yes the answer is yes um
 
04:41:48.868 --> 04:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
without going into a long laser lecture
 
04:41:51.628 --> 04:41:51.638 align:start position:0%
represent the freeze thank you madam
 
04:41:51.638 --> 04:41:53.070 align:start position:0%
represent the freeze thank you madam
chair

04:41:53.070 --> 04:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:41:57.350 --> 04:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
um prior to some of these surgeries do
 
04:41:59.150 --> 04:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
isn't there medication
 
04:42:01.230 --> 04:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
prescribed so I think you're thinking of
 
04:42:03.110 --> 04:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
cataract surgery and that's not in the
 
04:42:05.550 --> 04:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
bill so there are a number of drops that
 
04:42:08.550 --> 04:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
a patient has to take prior to cataract
 
04:42:12.430 --> 04:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
surgery um you might talking about GL
 
04:42:16.030 --> 04:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
the glaucoma laser um if you are
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's appropriate to prescribe
 
04:42:20.910 --> 04:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
medication first for a patient that has
 
04:42:22.788 --> 04:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
glaucoma sometimes it's more appropriate
 
04:42:25.510 --> 04:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
to do laser first um depending on the
 
04:42:27.270 --> 04:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
type of glaucoma we have but we're not
 
04:42:29.310 --> 04:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
doing this is does not include cataract
 
04:42:33.470 --> 04:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
surgery that requires many more
 
04:42:36.510 --> 04:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
uh you have to practice that a lot more
 
04:42:38.910 --> 04:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
and that is in under the purview of
 
04:42:40.868 --> 04:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology so that's not what we're
 
04:42:42.788 --> 04:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
asking came for follow up thank you
 
04:42:44.510 --> 04:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
04:42:47.230 --> 04:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
um is was one of these surgeries
 
04:42:50.270 --> 04:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
typically called lasic no none none none
 
04:42:51.910 --> 04:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
of these this is not lasic okay so it's
 
04:42:56.230 --> 04:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
not corrective okay no so there's no
 
04:42:58.270 --> 04:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
prior to any of these surgeries you were
 
04:43:01.708 --> 04:43:01.718 align:start position:0%
not provide um prescribing or I don't
 
04:43:03.270 --> 04:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
know if you have the power to do that we
 
04:43:06.390 --> 04:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
do to prescribe anti-anxiety medication
 
04:43:07.708 --> 04:43:07.718 align:start position:0%
because some people get a little worked
 
04:43:09.708 --> 04:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
up when things start coming at their
 
04:43:12.830 --> 04:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
eyes so that's often what's done with
 
04:43:16.110 --> 04:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
lasic it's Al also what I call the
 
04:43:17.550 --> 04:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
patient needs a happy juice before
 
04:43:19.550 --> 04:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
cataract surgery that's typically not
 
04:43:22.030 --> 04:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
required for the procedures in this bill
 
04:43:23.628 --> 04:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be common practice thank
 
04:43:25.830 --> 04:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
04:43:28.750 --> 04:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
S I had asked this question before you
 
04:43:30.708 --> 04:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
might know the answer do what
 
04:43:33.510 --> 04:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
neighboring states in New England here
 
04:43:36.910 --> 04:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
are have this have authorized these
 
04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
procedures that the bill talks about so
 
04:43:41.910 --> 04:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
in New England um
 
04:43:44.788 --> 04:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
there's none but we have a list of all
 
04:43:47.190 --> 04:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
the states across the country and
 
04:43:48.910 --> 04:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
because we've had to go to the
 
04:43:51.030 --> 04:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
legislature over and over and over again
 
04:43:53.510 --> 04:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
in every single state you'll see what
 
04:43:55.628 --> 04:43:55.638 align:start position:0%
looks like a hot mess um but we have
 
04:43:58.390 --> 04:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
provided that for you so some some
 
04:44:00.550 --> 04:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
states there are much more invasive
 
04:44:02.550 --> 04:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
surgical procedures that are allowed and
 
04:44:05.350 --> 04:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
not lasers and vice versa so I would
 
04:44:07.788 --> 04:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
encourage you to look at the full list
 
04:44:09.150 --> 04:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
but there
 
04:44:12.070 --> 04:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
are upwards of 30 I believe and one of
 
04:44:13.310 --> 04:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
my colleagues is actually going to give
 
04:44:15.750 --> 04:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
you the exact numbers um but we'll
 
04:44:18.350 --> 04:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
provide that but none local it's not
 
04:44:22.910 --> 04:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
local thank you representa thank you so
 
04:44:24.708 --> 04:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
you referred to this information that
 
04:44:26.948 --> 04:44:26.958 align:start position:0%
you've given to us did you email that to
 
04:44:29.150 --> 04:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
us no it's coming oh okay all right
 
04:44:31.990 --> 04:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you it's coming sorry okay thank
 
04:44:33.948 --> 04:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for your
 
04:44:35.310 --> 04:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
testimony yeah thank you for the
 
04:44:37.788 --> 04:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity representative Ms I have to
 
04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
apologize your card was buried in the
 
04:44:52.990 --> 04:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:55.070 --> 04:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman and uh and
 
04:44:57.030 --> 04:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um for the
 
04:45:00.110 --> 04:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
record my name is Chris muns I am still
 
04:45:01.830 --> 04:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
one of the four state representatives
 
04:45:04.150 --> 04:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
from Hampton representing four
 
04:45:06.390 --> 04:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
representatives from Hampton um I'm here
 
04:45:08.270 --> 04:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
in support of HB
 
04:45:11.470 --> 04:45:11.480 align:start position:0%
349 it will allow doctors of optomic to
 
04:45:14.110 --> 04:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
perform procedures that ODS are
 
04:45:17.470 --> 04:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
authorized to perform in 12 other states
 
04:45:19.708 --> 04:45:19.718 align:start position:0%
um but they will not be authorized to do
 
04:45:22.350 --> 04:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
so until they have been certified by the
 
04:45:24.590 --> 04:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Board of registry to
 
04:45:27.230 --> 04:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
perform uh in op Optometry to perform
 
04:45:28.590 --> 04:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
those procedures I think that's an
 
04:45:32.470 --> 04:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
important point a doctoral level uh
 
04:45:35.590 --> 04:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
degree program in Optometry is comprised
 
04:45:37.830 --> 04:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
of four additional years of classroom
 
04:45:40.390 --> 04:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
laboratory and clinical training at an
 
04:45:40.400 --> 04:45:41.628 align:start position:0%
laboratory and clinical training at an
accredited

04:45:41.628 --> 04:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
accredited
 
04:45:44.430 --> 04:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
optometry school after a student
 
04:45:46.310 --> 04:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
receives their undergraduate uh
 
04:45:49.190 --> 04:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree all such accredited
 
04:45:52.470 --> 04:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
Optometry schools teach laser procedures
 
04:45:54.390 --> 04:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
and there are ample opportunities around
 
04:45:56.990 --> 04:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
the country for the for the proctored
 
04:46:00.030 --> 04:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
live patient experience that um doctors
 
04:46:04.670 --> 04:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
need to um uh be certified on these
 
04:46:07.270 --> 04:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
procedures there is no reason therefore
 
04:46:09.868 --> 04:46:09.878 align:start position:0%
why someone who has an established and
 
04:46:11.750 --> 04:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
trusted relation relationship with their
 
04:46:15.150 --> 04:46:15.160 align:start position:0%
optometrist as I do should have to seek
 
04:46:18.310 --> 04:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
out someone who they do not know and who
 
04:46:21.110 --> 04:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
does not know them if they should need
 
04:46:22.470 --> 04:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
one of these
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
procedures one of the challenges we have
 
04:46:26.788 --> 04:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
in our state particularly in some of the
 
04:46:29.590 --> 04:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
more rural areas is the lack of access
 
04:46:33.070 --> 04:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
to healthc care providers passing HB 349
 
04:46:35.430 --> 04:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
will help to address that by expanding
 
04:46:37.910 --> 04:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
the availability of certified providers
 
04:46:40.670 --> 04:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
who can provide these Services I urge
 
04:46:44.470 --> 04:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
you to recommend HB 349 is ought to pass
 
04:46:49.628 --> 04:46:49.638 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions very
 
04:46:59.548 --> 04:46:59.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:01.868 --> 04:47:01.878 align:start position:0%
already thank you madam chair you have a
 
04:47:03.830 --> 04:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
handout this yeah we have a handout is
 
04:47:06.910 --> 04:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
your staff will passing out yes my name
 
04:47:09.190 --> 04:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
is Kimberly lardi I'm an opthalmologist
 
04:47:11.470 --> 04:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
practicing in uh New Hampshire at New
 
04:47:13.788 --> 04:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Eye Associates in Manchester
 
04:47:16.110 --> 04:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
for the past 15 years I'm the immediate
 
04:47:17.708 --> 04:47:17.718 align:start position:0%
past president of the New Hampshire
 
04:47:20.430 --> 04:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
Society of eye physicians and surgeons
 
04:47:22.110 --> 04:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm currently serving on the board
 
04:47:24.150 --> 04:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
for our society I do want to take a
 
04:47:25.310 --> 04:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
moment to highlight the fact that
 
04:47:27.628 --> 04:47:27.638 align:start position:0%
Optometry and Opthalmology have
 
04:47:29.350 --> 04:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
collaborated and worked together for
 
04:47:31.868 --> 04:47:31.878 align:start position:0%
decades we work together every day and
 
04:47:35.470 --> 04:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
often and often in the same offices
 
04:47:37.948 --> 04:47:37.958 align:start position:0%
optometrists are our valued colleagues
 
04:47:39.670 --> 04:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
our profession couldn't survive without
 
04:47:41.628 --> 04:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
theirs and vice versa
 
04:47:43.750 --> 04:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
in fact in 2021 the Opthalmology
 
04:47:45.788 --> 04:47:45.798 align:start position:0%
community did support the glaucoma
 
04:47:47.948 --> 04:47:47.958 align:start position:0%
expansion Bill to allow for treatment of
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
secondary glaucoma and remove some
 
04:47:52.190 --> 04:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
barriers that existed for optometrists
 
04:47:54.868 --> 04:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
to obtain their glaucoma certification
 
04:47:56.948 --> 04:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
we supported that 2021 bill as it was
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
safe and in the best interest of our
 
04:48:00.310 --> 04:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
patients this is not the case for House
 
04:48:03.270 --> 04:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
Bill 349 we oppose HP
 
04:48:05.990 --> 04:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
349 uh this seeks to allow optometrists
 
04:48:07.750 --> 04:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
who are not medical doctors to perform
 
04:48:10.910 --> 04:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
three laser surgeries these Surgical
 
04:48:12.350 --> 04:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
lasers are already performed by
 
04:48:13.990 --> 04:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive opthalmologists in our
 
04:48:16.230 --> 04:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
state one procedure is a postcataract
 
04:48:19.390 --> 04:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
laser surgery the other two are very
 
04:48:22.110 --> 04:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
distinct glaucoma lasers two of these
 
04:48:25.310 --> 04:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
are non-urgent surgical procedures and
 
04:48:27.350 --> 04:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
the third which can sometimes be
 
04:48:30.750 --> 04:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
emergent is falling out of favor for
 
04:48:33.470 --> 04:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
standard of care in many
 
04:48:37.390 --> 04:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
cases um presently 41 States Plus Puerto
 
04:48:39.868 --> 04:48:39.878 align:start position:0%
Rico and the District of Colombia and
 
04:48:42.548 --> 04:48:42.558 align:start position:0%
the VA prohibit optometrist from
 
04:48:45.470 --> 04:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
performing laser surgery this is written
 
04:48:48.190 --> 04:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
out in VHA directive
 
04:48:52.190 --> 04:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
1121 subsection 2 appendix
 
04:48:56.990 --> 04:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
G um of the VHA uh codes uh we would be
 
04:48:58.868 --> 04:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
the only state in New England permitting
 
04:49:01.350 --> 04:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
optometrist to perform s surgical lasers
 
04:49:03.948 --> 04:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
should this legislation pass um
 
04:49:06.788 --> 04:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
optometrist may receive training in
 
04:49:09.750 --> 04:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
these lasers the training is didactic
 
04:49:11.350 --> 04:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
and simulated
 
04:49:13.990 --> 04:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
only in two states in Kentucky and
 
04:49:16.110 --> 04:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma is there an optometry school
 
04:49:17.868 --> 04:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
well where they are allowed to perform
 
04:49:21.110 --> 04:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
lasers on live humans so Optometry
 
04:49:23.670 --> 04:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
students must be either relocating to
 
04:49:29.390 --> 04:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:31.750 --> 04:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
procedures um other states have passed
 
04:49:34.110 --> 04:49:34.120 align:start position:0%
similar legislation like Louisiana and
 
04:49:35.628 --> 04:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
Mississippi they require that their
 
04:49:37.510 --> 04:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
optometrist have demonstrated their
 
04:49:39.750 --> 04:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
coursework in optometry school or
 
04:49:42.350 --> 04:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
they've completed um what is known as
 
04:49:45.708 --> 04:49:45.718 align:start position:0%
the 32-hour weekend course um both of
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
which we find inadequate with regards to
 
04:49:49.830 --> 04:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
surgical training and you have heard
 
04:49:51.510 --> 04:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
some claims that young optometrists
 
04:49:53.628 --> 04:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
might be leaving our state to move to
 
04:49:55.788 --> 04:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
other states where they can perform
 
04:49:58.868 --> 04:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
lasers of 230 then there's a graph of
 
04:50:01.350 --> 04:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
this in your packet there's 239
 
04:50:03.230 --> 04:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
optometrists that filed Medicare Part B
 
04:50:06.948 --> 04:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
claims from 2013 to 2020 zero filed a
 
04:50:09.590 --> 04:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
Part B claim Elsewhere for laser surgery
 
04:50:12.270 --> 04:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
in 2021 that means if they left the
 
04:50:15.070 --> 04:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
state they did so for other reasons in
 
04:50:17.070 --> 04:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
fact not being allowed to perform lasers
 
04:50:18.948 --> 04:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
is not stopping new Young optometrist
 
04:50:21.548 --> 04:50:21.558 align:start position:0%
from Le relocating to New Hampshire um
 
04:50:24.708 --> 04:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
from 2013 to 2023 New Hampshire has
 
04:50:27.788 --> 04:50:27.798 align:start position:0%
added 73 young optometrist giving a
 
04:50:29.750 --> 04:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
growth rate of
 
04:50:32.310 --> 04:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
45.8% the population growth rate overall
 
04:50:34.190 --> 04:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
for our state is only
 
04:50:36.750 --> 04:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
5.6% so young optometrists are coming to
 
04:50:38.830 --> 04:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
our state to take advantage of what New
 
04:50:40.350 --> 04:50:40.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has to offer and that goes
 
04:50:42.590 --> 04:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
well beyond their Licensing Laws we want
 
04:50:44.708 --> 04:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
to continue to attract quality providers
 
04:50:46.628 --> 04:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
for the right reasons not so that they
 
04:50:49.150 --> 04:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
can practice at the top of their
 
04:50:51.670 --> 04:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
license last year we heard the concerns
 
04:50:54.030 --> 04:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
about access to um Opthalmic care
 
04:50:56.628 --> 04:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
particularly in the northern rural areas
 
04:50:58.628 --> 04:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
as such we are working to formulate a
 
04:51:00.310 --> 04:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
solution to help bridge this Gap while
 
04:51:02.390 --> 04:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
maintaining high standards of patient
 
04:51:04.350 --> 04:51:04.360 align:start position:0%
care and safety you're going to hear
 
04:51:06.510 --> 04:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
more about this from my colleagues the
 
04:51:08.430 --> 04:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
solution is not to lower the standard of
 
04:51:10.750 --> 04:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
surgical care instead we should work
 
04:51:12.470 --> 04:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
together collaboratively understanding
 
04:51:14.788 --> 04:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
our differing exper expertise and
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
ensuring that surgical procedures are
 
04:51:17.990 --> 04:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
performed by those with necessary
 
04:51:21.310 --> 04:51:21.320 align:start position:0%

then um thank you do Dr lardi
 
04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
um Dr hitchmoth made the point that
 
04:51:39.548 --> 04:51:39.558 align:start position:0%
optometrists actually get an earlier
 
04:51:43.070 --> 04:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
start examining and working with the eye
 
04:51:44.990 --> 04:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
than opthalmologists even though they're
 
04:51:48.150 --> 04:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
medical doctors so I guess my question I
 
04:51:51.590 --> 04:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
don't guess my question is how long is
 
04:51:54.910 --> 04:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
uh your if after you're a medical doctor
 
04:51:57.310 --> 04:51:57.320 align:start position:0%
how long is uh your training to be an
 
04:52:00.270 --> 04:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
opal opthalmologist so after four years
 
04:52:02.948 --> 04:52:02.958 align:start position:0%
of medical school we either do a
 
04:52:04.788 --> 04:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
one-year internship in surgery or
 
04:52:07.708 --> 04:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
medicine or something combined and then
 
04:52:09.708 --> 04:52:09.718 align:start position:0%
we do three years of Opthalmology
 
04:52:12.150 --> 04:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
residency and then an additional one to
 
04:52:16.030 --> 04:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:19.150 --> 04:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
training Howard thank you for taking my
 
04:52:21.350 --> 04:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
question uh I just want to ask you if
 
04:52:24.030 --> 04:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
you knew any uh of the pay differences
 
04:52:26.190 --> 04:52:26.200 align:start position:0%
between what's available in states that
 
04:52:28.110 --> 04:52:28.120 align:start position:0%
allow optometrists to perform these
 
04:52:30.270 --> 04:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
procedures in states that do not so
 
04:52:33.270 --> 04:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
Medicare rules prohibit having different
 
04:52:35.190 --> 04:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
um reimbursement rates whether it's an
 
04:52:37.190 --> 04:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist or an optometrist so they
 
04:52:39.548 --> 04:52:39.558 align:start position:0%
are there's not a way for them to charge
 
04:52:42.868 --> 04:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
a lower rate it it would be illegal
 
04:52:46.030 --> 04:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
actually so follow yeah you I'm not sure
 
04:52:48.190 --> 04:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
if you fully understood my question it
 
04:52:50.628 --> 04:52:50.638 align:start position:0%
was kind of more what is there salary
 
04:52:53.310 --> 04:52:53.320 align:start position:0%
difference between people uh for
 
04:52:55.910 --> 04:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
optometrists would their salary be say
 
04:52:58.190 --> 04:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
higher in Kentucky and Oklahoma versus
 
04:53:01.708 --> 04:53:01.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I can't see why it would
 
04:53:03.868 --> 04:53:03.878 align:start position:0%
necessarily okay thank
 
04:53:06.750 --> 04:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative
 
04:53:08.910 --> 04:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam
 
04:53:12.350 --> 04:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
chairman so uh one of the issues that's
 
04:53:15.788 --> 04:53:15.798 align:start position:0%
been raised even in this go around uh
 
04:53:18.510 --> 04:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
this time as opposed to the discussions
 
04:53:23.470 --> 04:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
we had in the previous attempt to um
 
04:53:25.628 --> 04:53:25.638 align:start position:0%
Institute something along the lines of
 
04:53:28.830 --> 04:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks uh one of the issues
 
04:53:32.470 --> 04:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
that been raised is the access for
 
04:53:35.510 --> 04:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
people in the North Country um and
 
04:53:38.430 --> 04:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
representative pedell in her testimony
 
04:53:41.510 --> 04:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
guesstimated that uh completing the
 
04:53:44.030 --> 04:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
entire legislative procedure and the
 
04:53:45.948 --> 04:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
other Preparatory steps that would be
 
04:53:48.788 --> 04:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
necessary to get the optometrist into
 
04:53:51.948 --> 04:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
this game uh as opposed to uh the
 
04:53:54.990 --> 04:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
current situation she gu guesstimated
 
04:53:58.708 --> 04:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
one to two years um if we had a
 
04:54:02.430 --> 04:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
situation where uh access was
 
04:54:05.150 --> 04:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
immediately enhanced or speedily
 
04:54:08.110 --> 04:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
enhanced by providing opthalmological
 
04:54:10.750 --> 04:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
services to the North country in the
 
04:54:12.948 --> 04:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
North country as opposed to having
 
04:54:15.510 --> 04:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
everybody come down here being driven
 
04:54:18.270 --> 04:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
down by a relative or something like
 
04:54:21.670 --> 04:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
that uh would that not be uh a much
 
04:54:24.670 --> 04:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
faster procedure for you for you
 
04:54:27.070 --> 04:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists to set up some kind of a
 
04:54:29.788 --> 04:54:29.798 align:start position:0%
situation in the North country where
 
04:54:32.628 --> 04:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
your colleagues would be up there
 
04:54:35.670 --> 04:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
providing the service at the level that
 
04:54:38.030 --> 04:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
you are trained for currently I'm going
 
04:54:39.948 --> 04:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
to let one of my colleagues get a little
 
04:54:42.150 --> 04:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
bit time frame I would guess six to
 
04:54:45.110 --> 04:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
eight months we'd be up and running did
 
04:54:47.270 --> 04:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
you say a month six six to eight months
 
04:54:48.390 --> 04:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
six to eight months between
 
04:54:50.270 --> 04:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
credentialing and some construction that
 
04:54:52.390 --> 04:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
needs to go on so and do you know
 
04:54:54.948 --> 04:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
whether followup and do you know whether
 
04:54:56.750 --> 04:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
there's anything underway for that
 
04:54:59.910 --> 04:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
matter to try to accomplish that yes in
 
04:55:03.350 --> 04:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
response to the recognized access issues
 
04:55:06.270 --> 04:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
yes there is and my f my the colleague
 
04:55:09.150 --> 04:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
that we have to follow um is going to
 
04:55:12.590 --> 04:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
elaborate on um this Access Project
 
04:55:12.600 --> 04:55:14.628 align:start position:0%
elaborate on um this Access Project
thank

04:55:14.628 --> 04:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:55:17.110 --> 04:55:17.120 align:start position:0%

04:55:50.708 --> 04:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
again in the goal of ensuring that safe
 
04:55:52.510 --> 04:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
and effective Eye Care is available to
 
04:55:54.868 --> 04:55:54.878 align:start position:0%

of Optometry I graduated from UNH and
 
04:56:03.948 --> 04:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
received my doctorate from the New
 
04:56:06.830 --> 04:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
England College of Optometry in Boston I
 
04:56:08.910 --> 04:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
live in gtown and recently started my
 
04:56:11.750 --> 04:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
own practice in Milford
 
04:56:13.110 --> 04:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
some of you may be familiar with the
 
04:56:14.548 --> 04:56:14.558 align:start position:0%
bill that came before this committee
 
04:56:16.470 --> 04:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
last year which had unanimous support in
 
04:56:19.910 --> 04:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate a unanimous vote in Edna
 
04:56:22.390 --> 04:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and more than 2third vote
 
04:56:23.830 --> 04:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the full committee before it was
 
04:56:26.788 --> 04:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
ultimately tabled on the house floor the
 
04:56:29.708 --> 04:56:29.718 align:start position:0%
bill before you today House Bill 349 is
 
04:56:32.150 --> 04:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
much more simplified and straightforward
 
04:56:35.230 --> 04:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
and it seeks to allow three specific in
 
04:56:38.070 --> 04:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
office non-invasive laser procedures by
 
04:56:40.230 --> 04:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
Doctors of Optometry these proced
 
04:56:42.190 --> 04:56:42.200 align:start position:0%
procedures would only be permitted after
 
04:56:44.030 --> 04:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
meeting certification requirements
 
04:56:45.590 --> 04:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
defined by the New Hampshire Board of
 
04:56:47.830 --> 04:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
Optometry which does include a
 
04:56:49.510 --> 04:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
requirement for live
 
04:56:51.990 --> 04:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
cases no optometrist would be able to
 
04:56:53.990 --> 04:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
come here and do lasers on anybody
 
04:56:56.470 --> 04:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
without having prior experience and
 
04:56:59.070 --> 04:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
being signed off certified they have
 
04:57:00.788 --> 04:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
done them on live
 
04:57:03.110 --> 04:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
patients every optometry school in the
 
04:57:05.190 --> 04:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
country trains every optometry student
 
04:57:07.670 --> 04:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
to perform these procedures and these
 
04:57:09.430 --> 04:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
laser procedures have been performed
 
04:57:11.548 --> 04:57:11.558 align:start position:0%
safely and effective L by optometrist
 
04:57:13.430 --> 04:57:13.440 align:start position:0%

record of
 
04:57:17.110 --> 04:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
safety Doctors of Optometry complete
 
04:57:19.310 --> 04:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
extensive postgraduate training
 
04:57:20.910 --> 04:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
following the completion of a 4-year
 
04:57:22.910 --> 04:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
undergraduate degree we complete a
 
04:57:24.990 --> 04:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
rigorous comprehensive four-year

than 50
 
04:57:54.030 --> 04:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
years we do not have 10,000 hours in

other surgeries like opthamologists do
 
04:57:59.470 --> 04:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
we are not trained to deliver babies we

have the hours that we are required to
 
04:58:08.990 --> 04:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
have so we are proficient in the
 
04:58:11.548 --> 04:58:11.558 align:start position:0%
procedures that we graduate
 
04:58:13.948 --> 04:58:13.958 align:start position:0%
doing despite our extensive Education
 
04:58:16.150 --> 04:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
and Training we are restricted from Full

unnecessary battles and delays
 
04:58:26.548 --> 04:58:26.558 align:start position:0%
ultimately denying New Hampshire

advancements are adopted as they should
 
04:58:34.390 --> 04:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
be not with legislative battles but with
 
04:58:35.868 --> 04:58:35.878 align:start position:0%
licensing boards ensuring that
 
04:58:38.190 --> 04:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
practitioners have the proper education
 
04:58:41.310 --> 04:58:41.320 align:start position:0%

the board of Optometry is fully prepared
 
04:58:44.548 --> 04:58:44.558 align:start position:0%
and qualified to oversee the
 
04:58:46.750 --> 04:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
implementation of this bill including
 
04:58:48.628 --> 04:58:48.638 align:start position:0%

safety I would like to reiterate that
 
04:58:57.350 --> 04:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
these are all in-office procedures in
 
04:58:59.470 --> 04:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
fact the lasers used to perform all
 
04:59:01.590 --> 04:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
three are Incorporated in the same
 
04:59:03.670 --> 04:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
microscope that every optometrist uses
 
04:59:05.750 --> 04:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
to evaluate the eye in every single eye
 
04:59:08.390 --> 04:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
exam and that we are trained to use from
 
04:59:11.510 --> 04:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
the very first days in Optometry School
 
04:59:13.230 --> 04:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
the first laser procedure addressed in
 
04:59:16.628 --> 04:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
houseb 349 is the yag laser capsulotomy
 
04:59:18.390 --> 04:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
this procedure is used to clear away a
 
04:59:19.990 --> 04:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
film that can develop after having
 
04:59:22.510 --> 04:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
cataract surgery the tissue behind the
 
04:59:24.548 --> 04:59:24.558 align:start position:0%
Cataract implant commonly develops a
 
04:59:26.270 --> 04:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
film and causes the vision to become
 
04:59:29.190 --> 04:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
blurry again the yag laser is used to
 
04:59:31.390 --> 04:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
create a clear opening and restore the
 
04:59:34.430 --> 04:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
vision the second laser procedure is the
 
04:59:37.948 --> 04:59:37.958 align:start position:0%
selective laser tcul plasty or SLT this
 
04:59:39.470 --> 04:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
procedure is used in the treatment of
 
04:59:41.390 --> 04:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
the most common Common forms of chronic
 
04:59:43.670 --> 04:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
glaucoma to lower eye pressure by
 
04:59:46.628 --> 04:59:46.638 align:start position:0%
targeting the drainage tissue for years
 
04:59:48.628 --> 04:59:48.638 align:start position:0%
SLT has been used as a treatment when
 
04:59:50.150 --> 04:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
glaucoma drops
 
04:59:52.510 --> 04:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
fail however research now shows that
 
04:59:54.628 --> 04:59:54.638 align:start position:0%
this is an effective firstline treatment
 
04:59:56.948 --> 04:59:56.958 align:start position:0%
prior to the use of glaucoma drops which
 
04:59:58.788 --> 04:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
can improve quality of life and reduce
 
05:00:00.830 --> 05:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
health care costs as demonstrated in
 
05:00:03.990 --> 05:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
several studies this procedure is also
 
05:00:06.628 --> 05:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
repeatable so if the effects wear off it
 
05:00:08.708 --> 05:00:08.718 align:start position:0%
can be repeated
 
05:00:11.270 --> 05:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
safely the third laser procedure is the
 
05:00:14.270 --> 05:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
laser peripheral iridotomy or an LPI
 
05:00:15.990 --> 05:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
where a laser is used to create a small
 
05:00:17.830 --> 05:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
opening in the iris to reduce the risk
 
05:00:20.390 --> 05:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
of sudden increases in pressure while
 
05:00:21.830 --> 05:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
this procedure can be performed
 
05:00:23.628 --> 05:00:23.638 align:start position:0%
preventatively for atrisk patients or
 
05:00:25.990 --> 05:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
for those with chronic glaucoma it may
 
05:00:27.750 --> 05:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
be needed in an emergency for those
 
05:00:29.430 --> 05:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
experiencing acute
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
glaucoma I have been on call where I
 
05:00:35.030 --> 05:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
have a patient with very high Skyhigh
 
05:00:37.230 --> 05:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
pressures and this is when minutes
 
05:00:40.030 --> 05:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
matter I have the laser in the Next Room
 
05:00:41.470 --> 05:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
and I have the knowledge and training to
 
05:00:43.590 --> 05:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
use it and to prevent the patient from
 
05:00:46.310 --> 05:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
losing vision but I have to set instead
 
05:00:49.070 --> 05:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
send them to Boston and our patients
 
05:00:49.080 --> 05:00:50.390 align:start position:0%
send them to Boston and our patients
deserve

05:00:50.390 --> 05:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
deserve
 
05:00:52.910 --> 05:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
better these three laser procedures are
 
05:00:55.110 --> 05:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
already permitted in 12 States and they
 
05:00:56.430 --> 05:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
have been performed by Doctors of
 
05:00:58.948 --> 05:00:58.958 align:start position:0%
Optometry for more than 30 years
 
05:01:00.510 --> 05:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
beginning in Oklahoma and it was
 
05:01:02.990 --> 05:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
actually 1988 when the first laser
 
05:01:04.548 --> 05:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
procedure was performed by an
 
05:01:07.948 --> 05:01:07.958 align:start position:0%
optometrist in 1988 evidence shows that
 
05:01:09.628 --> 05:01:09.638 align:start position:0%
these Optometric procedures are both
 
05:01:12.350 --> 05:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
safe and effective with more than
 
05:01:14.670 --> 05:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
140,000 laser procedures performed with
 
05:01:14.680 --> 05:01:15.510 align:start position:0%
140,000 laser procedures performed with
only

05:01:15.510 --> 05:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
only
 
05:01:17.470 --> 05:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
0.001% negative
 
05:01:20.270 --> 05:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
outcomes additionally Optometric
 
05:01:22.628 --> 05:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
malpractice rates have shown no increase
 
05:01:23.628 --> 05:01:23.638 align:start position:0%
in the states where these laser
 
05:01:25.750 --> 05:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
procedures are performed by optometrist
 
05:01:27.510 --> 05:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
and no state has repealed any
 
05:01:29.230 --> 05:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
advancement in Optometric privileges
 
05:01:32.070 --> 05:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
ever lasers or
 
05:01:34.390 --> 05:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise some may see this bill as an
 
05:01:35.830 --> 05:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
expansion of scope but really the
 
05:01:37.430 --> 05:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
Optometric scope expansion occurred
 
05:01:39.070 --> 05:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
nearly four decades ago when these
 
05:01:40.948 --> 05:01:40.958 align:start position:0%
lasers were first performed by Doctors
 
05:01:44.190 --> 05:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
of Optometry House Bill 349 is a
 
05:01:45.590 --> 05:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
modernization of the New Hampshire
 
05:01:48.190 --> 05:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
Optometric statute which has been which
 
05:01:50.030 --> 05:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
has not seen an update on any
 
05:01:53.150 --> 05:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
significant level in over 20 years
 
05:01:55.430 --> 05:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
importantly House Bill 349 does not
 
05:01:57.030 --> 05:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
permit anything that is outside the
 
05:02:00.230 --> 05:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
Education and Training of Doctors of
 
05:02:03.390 --> 05:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
Optometry the opposition our colleagues
 
05:02:05.548 --> 05:02:05.558 align:start position:0%
in opthomology want you to believe
 
05:02:08.350 --> 05:02:08.360 align:start position:0%
otherwise you will hear from time from
 
05:02:09.990 --> 05:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
them time and again that we do not have
 
05:02:11.548 --> 05:02:11.558 align:start position:0%
the Education and Training for these
 
05:02:15.150 --> 05:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
procedures that simply is not true what
 
05:02:16.830 --> 05:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
they really mean is that we do not have
 
05:02:19.230 --> 05:02:19.240 align:start position:0%
their Education and Training and we
 
05:02:22.350 --> 05:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly agree there is overlap
 
05:02:23.750 --> 05:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
and there are vast differences in the
 
05:02:25.310 --> 05:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
Education and Training of optometrist
 
05:02:27.390 --> 05:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
and opthamologists there are hundreds of
 
05:02:28.590 --> 05:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
procedures and surgeries that
 
05:02:30.350 --> 05:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists are trained to perform
 
05:02:32.510 --> 05:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
that are far beyond Optometric training
 
05:02:34.628 --> 05:02:34.638 align:start position:0%
and beyond that of House Bill
 
05:02:37.190 --> 05:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
349 medical school is not the sole
 
05:02:39.350 --> 05:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
institution where in-office procedures
 
05:02:40.948 --> 05:02:40.958 align:start position:0%
are taught caught or where individuals
 
05:02:43.190 --> 05:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
can receive a legitimate healthare
 
05:02:45.670 --> 05:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
education I also want to be clear that
 
05:02:47.990 --> 05:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
no one is claiming these lasers are
 
05:02:51.110 --> 05:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
simple or easy these are complex
 
05:02:53.548 --> 05:02:53.558 align:start position:0%
procedures that are not without risk and
 
05:02:56.470 --> 05:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
complications as with every procedure in
 
05:02:58.070 --> 05:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
every healthc care profession there are
 
05:03:00.628 --> 05:03:00.638 align:start position:0%
negative outcomes although the rate of
 
05:03:02.750 --> 05:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
complications mon Optometric lasers is
 
05:03:06.470 --> 05:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
very low it is not zero some of you in
 
05:03:07.990 --> 05:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
this room may recall hearing from a
 
05:03:09.830 --> 05:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
patient last year who was brought here
 
05:03:11.990 --> 05:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
from Oklahoma to tell you of a very
 
05:03:13.470 --> 05:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunate outcome from a laser
 
05:03:16.150 --> 05:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
procedures performed by an
 
05:03:18.350 --> 05:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
optometrist if you did not hear from her
 
05:03:20.430 --> 05:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
you may still see her in a video which
 
05:03:21.910 --> 05:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
opposition is actively working to
 
05:03:24.070 --> 05:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
distribute among the public and the
 
05:03:26.110 --> 05:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
legislature what you will not hear from
 
05:03:27.750 --> 05:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
them however is that the same negative
 
05:03:29.868 --> 05:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
outcome from her laser procedure has
 
05:03:32.230 --> 05:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
occurred at the hands of Opthalmology as
 
05:03:35.030 --> 05:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
well no provider is immune from
 
05:03:37.750 --> 05:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
complications neither Optometry or
 
05:03:40.190 --> 05:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology but over 140 ,000
 
05:03:41.670 --> 05:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
procedures have demonstrated that there
 
05:03:43.510 --> 05:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
are no increased complication rates when
 
05:03:46.470 --> 05:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
performed by optometrist as compared to
 
05:03:48.270 --> 05:03:48.280 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists something else you will
 
05:03:49.990 --> 05:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
likely hear from the opposition time and
 
05:03:52.830 --> 05:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
again is surgery by surgeons they paint
 
05:03:54.470 --> 05:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
the picture of these procedures as being
 
05:03:57.948 --> 05:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
on par with cataract surgery lasc or
 
05:03:57.958 --> 05:03:59.110 align:start position:0%
on par with cataract surgery lasc or
retinal

05:03:59.110 --> 05:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
retinal
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
surgery just today I saw an ad in
 
05:04:03.628 --> 05:04:03.638 align:start position:0%
opposition showing a surgeon wearing a
 
05:04:05.390 --> 05:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
um using a scalpel dawned with a
 
05:04:07.708 --> 05:04:07.718 align:start position:0%
surgical cap a surgical mask and a
 
05:04:10.030 --> 05:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
surgical gown none of which have
 
05:04:12.708 --> 05:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
anything to do with these procedures
 
05:04:14.548 --> 05:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
this is one example of the scare tactics
 
05:04:17.430 --> 05:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
being used by the opposition to be clear
 
05:04:19.070 --> 05:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
none of the three laser procedures
 
05:04:21.670 --> 05:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
addressed in House Bill 349 involve
 
05:04:23.510 --> 05:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
cutting into the eye or general
 
05:04:25.350 --> 05:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
anesthesia they are all performed
 
05:04:27.470 --> 05:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
sitting upright at a microscope just
 
05:04:30.670 --> 05:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
like the one we use all day every day
 
05:04:32.510 --> 05:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
these three lasers are used to treat the
 
05:04:33.868 --> 05:04:33.878 align:start position:0%
conditions that we have been managing
 
05:04:36.708 --> 05:04:36.718 align:start position:0%
since the Advent of these lasers Doctors
 
05:04:38.350 --> 05:04:38.360 align:start position:0%
of Optometry have been identifying
 
05:04:39.750 --> 05:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate candidates for these
 
05:04:41.750 --> 05:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
procedures educating our patients on the
 
05:04:44.350 --> 05:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
risks benefits and Alternatives and have
 
05:04:45.628 --> 05:04:45.638 align:start position:0%
been managing the associated
 
05:04:48.590 --> 05:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
complications since they came into use
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
many of the potential complications are
 
05:04:52.590 --> 05:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
managed with eye drops which we already
 
05:04:54.590 --> 05:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
prescribe in the incredibly rare
 
05:04:56.310 --> 05:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
instance that a retinal Subs specialist
 
05:04:58.270 --> 05:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
is required Doctors of Optometry would
 
05:05:01.230 --> 05:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
refer to the subsp specialist just as a
 
05:05:03.990 --> 05:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
general opthalmologist would do no
 
05:05:05.430 --> 05:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
matter who is treating the patient the
 
05:05:07.190 --> 05:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
protocols are the same and we are held
 
05:05:09.190 --> 05:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
to the same standard of care to
 
05:05:12.390 --> 05:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
recognize a complication and treat it or
 
05:05:14.990 --> 05:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
refer as Healthcare Providers we also
 
05:05:17.030 --> 05:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
share the same professional ethics where
 
05:05:19.708 --> 05:05:19.718 align:start position:0%
just because we can perform a procedure
 
05:05:22.830 --> 05:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
does not mean we do when there is a case
 
05:05:24.070 --> 05:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
that is better handled by our
 
05:05:26.190 --> 05:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology colleagues we will still
 
05:05:28.470 --> 05:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
continue to refer those cases and have
 
05:05:32.350 --> 05:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
an ethical obligation to do so in short
 
05:05:34.510 --> 05:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 349 will modernize the
 
05:05:36.310 --> 05:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
Optometric Statute in New Hampshire to
 
05:05:38.190 --> 05:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
be in Greater alignment with the current
 
05:05:39.910 --> 05:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
Optometric education and train training
 
05:05:41.990 --> 05:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
that occurs in every optometry school in
 
05:05:44.190 --> 05:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
the country these procedures are proven
 
05:05:45.910 --> 05:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
to be safe and effective when performed
 
05:05:48.030 --> 05:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
by appropriately certified Doctors of
 
05:05:50.430 --> 05:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
Optometry New Hampshire citizens deserve
 
05:05:52.548 --> 05:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
access to the full extent of Optometric
 
05:05:55.910 --> 05:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
care to en to ensure safe quality
 
05:05:57.948 --> 05:05:57.958 align:start position:0%
comprehensive eye care for
 
05:06:00.190 --> 05:06:00.200 align:start position:0%
all thank you for your
 
05:06:02.830 --> 05:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
time thank you
 
05:06:06.470 --> 05:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
questions um represent bro and then
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you um
 
05:06:16.150 --> 05:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
so in the bill it talks about I was on
 
05:06:17.430 --> 05:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
this committee last year when we heard
 
05:06:19.948 --> 05:06:19.958 align:start position:0%
this film and one of the things that we
 
05:06:25.310 --> 05:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
talked about was the training on
 
05:06:28.510 --> 05:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
live patience yes because I think live
 
05:06:31.350 --> 05:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
humans I think humans are live right so
 
05:06:35.548 --> 05:06:35.558 align:start position:0%
yeah live patience and um but it saids
 
05:06:37.110 --> 05:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
you were able to perform these
 
05:06:39.190 --> 05:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
procedures with proficiency which I'm
 
05:06:42.628 --> 05:06:42.638 align:start position:0%
glad to see that word yes so how does
 
05:06:45.350 --> 05:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
that happen how does how do you become
 
05:06:47.628 --> 05:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
how can you demonstrate
 
05:06:51.868 --> 05:06:51.878 align:start position:0%
proficiency well it is how all medical
 
05:06:54.430 --> 05:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
institutions demonstrate proficiency
 
05:06:59.230 --> 05:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
where they have Proctors they have um
 
05:07:01.548 --> 05:07:01.558 align:start position:0%
Educators that are teaching these
 
05:07:04.470 --> 05:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
procedures that are certified to do them
 
05:07:05.910 --> 05:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
and they have to pass certain
 
05:07:08.548 --> 05:07:08.558 align:start position:0%
requirements and proficiencies and if a
 
05:07:11.030 --> 05:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
student or or a doctor that is going
 
05:07:13.708 --> 05:07:13.718 align:start position:0%
back for certification is not found to
 
05:07:15.788 --> 05:07:15.798 align:start position:0%
be proficient in these procedures they
 
05:07:15.798 --> 05:07:19.830 align:start position:0%
be proficient in these procedures they
cannot

05:07:19.830 --> 05:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:24.670 --> 05:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
pass follow up thank you and so where
 
05:07:24.680 --> 05:07:26.150 align:start position:0%
pass follow up thank you and so where
might

05:07:26.150 --> 05:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
might
 
05:07:29.230 --> 05:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
this one of the P that I made at the end
 
05:07:33.150 --> 05:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
of last year was that opthalmologists
 
05:07:36.070 --> 05:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
and optometrists would get together to
 
05:07:38.708 --> 05:07:38.718 align:start position:0%
talk about this training and that
 
05:07:43.350 --> 05:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology would support you in that
 
05:07:46.270 --> 05:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
training and has can you confirm or can
 
05:07:50.070 --> 05:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:55.670 --> 05:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
is there is no change to that um
 
05:07:59.030 --> 05:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
historically Opthalmology has not ever
 
05:08:01.470 --> 05:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
supported any scope expansion they have
 
05:08:04.030 --> 05:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
opposed it going back decades and
 
05:08:07.030 --> 05:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
decades and they do not know our
 
05:08:08.788 --> 05:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
training they haven't had it they
 
05:08:10.470 --> 05:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
haven't gone through
 
05:08:13.190 --> 05:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
we have and so we are the ones that
 
05:08:15.628 --> 05:08:15.638 align:start position:0%
should be speaking about our
 
05:08:19.430 --> 05:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
training um as far as the glaucoma bill
 
05:08:21.628 --> 05:08:21.638 align:start position:0%
that they did not oppose the secondary
 
05:08:23.788 --> 05:08:23.798 align:start position:0%
glaucomas in that
 
05:08:27.390 --> 05:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
bill were so far outdated that any
 
05:08:29.628 --> 05:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
argument would have
 
05:08:33.830 --> 05:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
just been yeah um we were one of the
 
05:08:36.390 --> 05:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
very last States in fact a lot of us
 
05:08:38.150 --> 05:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that was still in there
 
05:08:40.350 --> 05:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
it was more of a an oversight and that
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
was a
 
05:08:45.270 --> 05:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
cleanup um as far as another example is
 
05:08:47.070 --> 05:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
they also opposed us being able to
 
05:08:50.430 --> 05:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
administer vaccines when 18-year-olds
 
05:08:52.868 --> 05:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
with a GED can administer vaccines in
 
05:08:52.878 --> 05:08:54.948 align:start position:0%
with a GED can administer vaccines in
this

05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:08:57.548 --> 05:08:57.558 align:start position:0%
state thank you thank you representative
 
05:09:00.030 --> 05:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you for taking my question
 
05:09:02.590 --> 05:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
uh how many hours uh of training to
 
05:09:05.788 --> 05:09:05.798 align:start position:0%
optim optometrist go through about
 
05:09:08.430 --> 05:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
10,000 10,000 all right thank you
 
05:09:11.070 --> 05:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
represent lamb uh thank you madam chair
 
05:09:13.948 --> 05:09:13.958 align:start position:0%
um within this whole process there's are
 
05:09:15.548 --> 05:09:15.558 align:start position:0%
there's national board certification
 
05:09:17.548 --> 05:09:17.558 align:start position:0%
that you have that's the standard that's
 
05:09:19.310 --> 05:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
used in other medical professions in
 
05:09:21.070 --> 05:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
order to determine
 
05:09:25.230 --> 05:09:25.240 align:start position:0%
competency yeah we cannot obtain lure in
 
05:09:27.390 --> 05:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
any state without being board certified
 
05:09:30.190 --> 05:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
and that's on the national level if um
 
05:09:31.708 --> 05:09:31.718 align:start position:0%
you don't pass you don't get licensed
 
05:09:34.750 --> 05:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
you don't practice period thank you fell
 
05:09:36.830 --> 05:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
and that National licensing licensing
 
05:09:38.788 --> 05:09:38.798 align:start position:0%
board includes the competencies that are
 
05:09:42.708 --> 05:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
referenced here they are included as far
 
05:09:45.510 --> 05:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
as dactic portion because they're not
 
05:09:47.830 --> 05:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
included in every state it is something
 
05:09:50.390 --> 05:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
you can get an additional certification
 
05:09:54.390 --> 05:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
in thank you other
 
05:09:57.510 --> 05:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
questions second question is perhaps
 
05:09:59.310 --> 05:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
you've picked up from the tone of my
 
05:10:01.788 --> 05:10:01.798 align:start position:0%
earlier questions I would be far more
 
05:10:06.350 --> 05:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
comfortable following in a a state like
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
New York or Massachusetts rather than
 
05:10:12.310 --> 05:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
than being the pioneer of this can you
 
05:10:14.830 --> 05:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
speak to why this has not happened in
 
05:10:16.788 --> 05:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
our neighboring
 
05:10:19.548 --> 05:10:19.558 align:start position:0%
states well you also don't want to be
 
05:10:23.948 --> 05:10:23.958 align:start position:0%
last um and we're certainly not first in
 
05:10:26.310 --> 05:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
the country yes we would be first in New
 
05:10:28.390 --> 05:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
England which would be obviously we
 
05:10:31.548 --> 05:10:31.558 align:start position:0%
think a great thing um New York and
 
05:10:31.558 --> 05:10:34.310 align:start position:0%
think a great thing um New York and
Massachusetts

05:10:34.310 --> 05:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
05:10:37.150 --> 05:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
specifically are last because of the
 
05:10:39.548 --> 05:10:39.558 align:start position:0%
strong medical community presence there
 
05:10:43.670 --> 05:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
and the opposition in those States and
 
05:10:45.868 --> 05:10:45.878 align:start position:0%
that's what we believe to be because
 
05:10:48.190 --> 05:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts you know for being such a
 
05:10:49.910 --> 05:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
progressive area of the
 
05:10:53.910 --> 05:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
country um those State states do lag
 
05:10:59.310 --> 05:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:03.830 --> 05:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
scope person Bailey question okay anyone
 
05:11:05.670 --> 05:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
else thank you very much for your
 
05:11:08.430 --> 05:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
testimony Dr Peters Madam chair I have a
 
05:11:10.510 --> 05:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
question to the chair yes so how many
 
05:11:17.190 --> 05:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:20.548 --> 05:11:20.558 align:start position:0%
have 10 including Dr Peters okay so we
 
05:11:22.230 --> 05:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
are going to subcommittee with this are
 
05:11:24.868 --> 05:11:24.878 align:start position:0%
we not yes may I suggest that we not
 
05:11:28.788 --> 05:11:28.798 align:start position:0%
have all the potential written testimony
 
05:11:32.270 --> 05:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
read to us aloud believe it or not I am
 
05:11:34.948 --> 05:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
highly educated and I read quite
 
05:11:37.590 --> 05:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
proficiently uh and I promise you I will
 
05:11:40.910 --> 05:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
read everything submitted to us gives me
 
05:11:44.788 --> 05:11:44.798 align:start position:0%
the option of studying it rereading IT
 
05:11:47.110 --> 05:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
consulting looking up words I don't know
 
05:11:50.910 --> 05:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
and so forth and this is not an
 
05:11:53.470 --> 05:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
efficient way of getting at the core
 
05:11:56.070 --> 05:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
information that we need we have a lot
 
05:11:59.510 --> 05:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
of Doctors of Optometry and Opthalmology
 
05:12:01.788 --> 05:12:01.798 align:start position:0%
here who are taking precious time away
 
05:12:05.030 --> 05:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
from people who need their attention and
 
05:12:07.430 --> 05:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
I don't want to sit here and continue to
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
be read to uh I want to get at the core
 
05:12:15.230 --> 05:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
information so that we can let everybody
 
05:12:17.670 --> 05:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
speak before we turn into
 
05:12:20.070 --> 05:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
zombies yes I and I would say that
 
05:12:21.830 --> 05:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
somebody that wants to talk for 10
 
05:12:23.948 --> 05:12:23.958 align:start position:0%
minutes when they have written testimony
 
05:12:26.548 --> 05:12:26.558 align:start position:0%
should probably work on abbreviating
 
05:12:26.558 --> 05:12:28.548 align:start position:0%
should probably work on abbreviating
that

05:12:28.548 --> 05:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:12:46.990 --> 05:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:50.390 --> 05:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
yeah no I I have the chair so Dr Peters
 
05:12:52.910 --> 05:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
turn the microphone on and please
 
05:12:54.830 --> 05:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
directly into the
 
05:12:57.230 --> 05:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
microphone yes sir thank you thank you
 
05:12:59.788 --> 05:12:59.798 align:start position:0%
representative Leighton everybody um I'm
 
05:13:01.150 --> 05:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
going to talk about something different
 
05:13:03.390 --> 05:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
today I'm going to talk about the um
 
05:13:06.070 --> 05:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
during the last legislature they talked
 
05:13:07.830 --> 05:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
about the lack of access in the North
 
05:13:09.230 --> 05:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
country and that's come up quite a bit
 
05:13:11.868 --> 05:13:11.878 align:start position:0%
today um and quite frankly would I
 
05:13:14.470 --> 05:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
didn't realize exactly the level of lack
 
05:13:16.310 --> 05:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
of access in the North country before it
 
05:13:18.708 --> 05:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
was raised so I began researching it and
 
05:13:20.230 --> 05:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
I started looking to see who was around
 
05:13:21.990 --> 05:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
the closest person around is Dr Sawyer
 
05:13:25.788 --> 05:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
an optometrist um she's you know a
 
05:13:27.750 --> 05:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
person in one practice she has someone
 
05:13:29.868 --> 05:13:29.878 align:start position:0%
who works with her um on their practice
 
05:13:31.470 --> 05:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
website it says that if you're a new
 
05:13:33.510 --> 05:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
patient expect several months of weight
 
05:13:36.270 --> 05:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
to be seen for any reason so then I was
 
05:13:37.788 --> 05:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
like wow this is really a problem we
 
05:13:39.270 --> 05:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
need to do something about this so I
 
05:13:41.830 --> 05:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
began working 9 months ago to see what
 
05:13:44.430 --> 05:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
we can do about bringing this 9% of the
 
05:13:46.190 --> 05:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
population in New Hampshire care in the
 
05:13:48.868 --> 05:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
North Country um so I started working
 
05:13:50.430 --> 05:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
with Andrew gagen Valley Hospital in
 
05:13:53.590 --> 05:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
Berlin um with their CEO and their CMO
 
05:13:55.948 --> 05:13:55.958 align:start position:0%
about bringing Opthalmology there to
 
05:13:58.510 --> 05:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
address the concerns of the citizens and
 
05:13:59.948 --> 05:13:59.958 align:start position:0%
so for eight months we've been working
 
05:14:01.708 --> 05:14:01.718 align:start position:0%
on a plan with them in the North Country
 
05:14:04.548 --> 05:14:04.558 align:start position:0%
Health Care system and we've made
 
05:14:07.230 --> 05:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
significant progress already uh they've
 
05:14:09.948 --> 05:14:09.958 align:start position:0%
identified space on their campus for us
 
05:14:12.070 --> 05:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh to do the clinic that will work we've
 
05:14:14.350 --> 05:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
had an architect design the plans we
 
05:14:16.788 --> 05:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
have a purchasing equipment list and
 
05:14:19.470 --> 05:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
everything ready to go site visit is the
 
05:14:22.110 --> 05:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
next um thing and I'm meeting with there
 
05:14:25.070 --> 05:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
with him and uh the the CEO Mike
 
05:14:27.750 --> 05:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
Peterson and the CMO and the other
 
05:14:29.190 --> 05:14:29.200 align:start position:0%
representatives of the North Country
 
05:14:31.628 --> 05:14:31.638 align:start position:0%
healthc care system to iron out the
 
05:14:34.990 --> 05:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
remaining details um CEO Peterson has
 
05:14:37.030 --> 05:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
said that he expects that this is this
 
05:14:38.230 --> 05:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
is their one of their number one
 
05:14:40.590 --> 05:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
priorities for 2025 and he expects this
 
05:14:43.548 --> 05:14:43.558 align:start position:0%
program to be up and running in 8 to 12
 
05:14:47.310 --> 05:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
months um this is going to address not
 
05:14:49.350 --> 05:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
only these three laser surgeries these
 
05:14:51.390 --> 05:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
three laser surgeries are literally
 
05:14:55.110 --> 05:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
maybe at most 1% of what we do this is
 
05:14:57.590 --> 05:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
not solving access to anyone anywhere
 
05:14:59.548 --> 05:14:59.558 align:start position:0%
it's really not a true
 
05:15:02.150 --> 05:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
statement um this is a tiny little
 
05:15:04.548 --> 05:15:04.558 align:start position:0%
sliver of optology what people in the
 
05:15:06.948 --> 05:15:06.958 align:start position:0%
North Country need they need care for
 
05:15:08.708 --> 05:15:08.718 align:start position:0%
their diabetic retinopathy they need
 
05:15:10.628 --> 05:15:10.638 align:start position:0%
care for their immacula degeneration
 
05:15:12.548 --> 05:15:12.558 align:start position:0%
they need care for their glaucoma their
 
05:15:15.390 --> 05:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
cataracts you know and yes these laser
 
05:15:17.030 --> 05:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
procedures would be great one these are
 
05:15:19.788 --> 05:15:19.798 align:start position:0%
mostly one-time procedures right um but
 
05:15:22.230 --> 05:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
they need this ongoing care you know um
 
05:15:23.788 --> 05:15:23.798 align:start position:0%
you had a representative speaking about
 
05:15:25.628 --> 05:15:25.638 align:start position:0%
how he gets a shot in his eye every six
 
05:15:27.350 --> 05:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
to eight weeks you know that's macular
 
05:15:29.430 --> 05:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
degeneration right you need that
 
05:15:31.470 --> 05:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
repeatedly so this bill would not
 
05:15:33.670 --> 05:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
address that but our plan does so we
 
05:15:36.070 --> 05:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
have over 25 opthalmologists who've
 
05:15:38.270 --> 05:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
agreed to rotate up there and provide
 
05:15:40.230 --> 05:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
twice a month coverage in
 
05:15:43.310 --> 05:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
Berlin um and this um is really a
 
05:15:46.948 --> 05:15:46.958 align:start position:0%
significant step forward um we're
 
05:15:49.990 --> 05:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
pleased that we can offer a free market
 
05:15:52.990 --> 05:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
solution from Granite Staters to Granite
 
05:15:55.788 --> 05:15:55.798 align:start position:0%
Staters in Berlin um without the need
 
05:15:55.798 --> 05:15:56.670 align:start position:0%
Staters in Berlin um without the need
for

05:15:56.670 --> 05:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:15:59.948 --> 05:15:59.958 align:start position:0%
legislation um so we're excited about it
 
05:16:02.110 --> 05:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
and I welcome any questions on the topic
 
05:16:03.868 --> 05:16:03.878 align:start position:0%
and I try to keep it
 
05:16:06.390 --> 05:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
short thank you any questions from the
 
05:16:10.948 --> 05:16:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:13.430 --> 05:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor thank you madam chair
 
05:16:16.150 --> 05:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh so uh you heard
 
05:16:19.750 --> 05:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
my hypothetical question earlier in the
 
05:16:22.110 --> 05:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
testimony in the hearing with regard to
 
05:16:23.948 --> 05:16:23.958 align:start position:0%
whether it would not be more expeditious
 
05:16:27.590 --> 05:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
to get the top and most
 
05:16:32.910 --> 05:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
important level and and number of of
 
05:16:35.788 --> 05:16:35.798 align:start position:0%
treatments to North Country in North
 
05:16:38.990 --> 05:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
Country uh by opthalmologists so that we
 
05:16:42.788 --> 05:16:42.798 align:start position:0%
are not limiting ourselves to the three
 
05:16:47.110 --> 05:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh procedures uh that this bill seeks to
 
05:16:49.750 --> 05:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
implement in New Hampshire uh can you
 
05:16:52.230 --> 05:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
can you uh you already gave me a
 
05:16:56.670 --> 05:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
guesstimate of six to eight months um
 
05:16:58.990 --> 05:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
representative petal suggested a year to
 
05:17:02.190 --> 05:17:02.200 align:start position:0%
two years just to get through the uh
 
05:17:03.910 --> 05:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
legislative end of things and the
 
05:17:07.590 --> 05:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
training end of things uh can we see
 
05:17:10.708 --> 05:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
some uh some written information at some
 
05:17:14.590 --> 05:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
point soon in the subcommittee perhaps
 
05:17:17.750 --> 05:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
which will lay out what you describing
 
05:17:20.948 --> 05:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
to us in outline form yes sir I'd be
 
05:17:22.868 --> 05:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
happy to provide that we we have all of
 
05:17:25.948 --> 05:17:25.958 align:start position:0%
that um I I think it's going to be great
 
05:17:27.830 --> 05:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
it literally covers all of the needs of
 
05:17:30.868 --> 05:17:30.878 align:start position:0%
the people there on site AVH does this
 
05:17:32.548 --> 05:17:32.558 align:start position:0%
with other Specialties they're used to
 
05:17:35.670 --> 05:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
doing this um so when we started this
 
05:17:37.270 --> 05:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
process they're like we know how to do
 
05:17:39.070 --> 05:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
this we can get this done and we want to
 
05:17:41.590 --> 05:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
get it done this calendar year um and
 
05:17:43.590 --> 05:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
this can serve as a role model for other
 
05:17:45.430 --> 05:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
Specialties to bring other types of
 
05:17:48.628 --> 05:17:48.638 align:start position:0%
access to the North Country not just
 
05:17:51.510 --> 05:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
opthomology followup follow up thank you
 
05:17:55.590 --> 05:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair so the thing is um obviously
 
05:17:57.830 --> 05:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
there are a whole series of things
 
05:17:59.708 --> 05:17:59.718 align:start position:0%
between the opto are you going to
 
05:18:01.470 --> 05:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
include some opto
 
05:18:03.430 --> 05:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
optometrists that you will bring with
 
05:18:06.070 --> 05:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
you as part of the team that you are
 
05:18:09.788 --> 05:18:09.798 align:start position:0%
talking about that obviously Focus is on
 
05:18:11.830 --> 05:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
opthalmological uh
 
05:18:14.230 --> 05:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
opthalmological um procedures because
 
05:18:16.350 --> 05:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
those are the most critical and crucial
 
05:18:18.548 --> 05:18:18.558 align:start position:0%
ones and the ones that are clearly not
 
05:18:20.830 --> 05:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
being provided in the North Country at
 
05:18:24.510 --> 05:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
this time but some things are clearly
 
05:18:24.520 --> 05:18:26.390 align:start position:0%
this time but some things are clearly
also

05:18:26.390 --> 05:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:18:28.910 --> 05:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
optomet Specialties are you going to
 
05:18:31.670 --> 05:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
provide that as well at this Hospital in
 
05:18:33.270 --> 05:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
the North country and which one would
 
05:18:35.628 --> 05:18:35.638 align:start position:0%
that be so we're working currently with
 
05:18:38.310 --> 05:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
AVH and and I believe the North Country
 
05:18:40.590 --> 05:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
Healthcare plan is to bring the other
 
05:18:42.110 --> 05:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
members of the North Country Healthcare
 
05:18:44.990 --> 05:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
to Berlin to get these Services there is
 
05:18:47.990 --> 05:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
optim optometrist care in Berlin Dr
 
05:18:50.310 --> 05:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
Sawyer and her partner I can't remember
 
05:18:52.590 --> 05:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
her name are there um and happy to work
 
05:18:53.990 --> 05:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
with them we used to work with them all
 
05:18:55.590 --> 05:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
the time we used to work literally in
 
05:18:58.390 --> 05:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
their office um with them so happy to
 
05:19:00.310 --> 05:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
continue that I don't know that um you
 
05:19:02.070 --> 05:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
know unless Dr Sawyer says she wants me
 
05:19:03.470 --> 05:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
to bring somebody I don't know that I
 
05:19:05.510 --> 05:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
need to bring anyone to help
 
05:19:07.350 --> 05:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
her I
 
05:19:10.390 --> 05:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
I question I won't I won't ask you all
 
05:19:14.510 --> 05:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
the other questions I have but but uh um
 
05:19:16.470 --> 05:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful if some of you could
 
05:19:20.190 --> 05:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
come to the subcommittee because we need
 
05:19:21.788 --> 05:19:21.798 align:start position:0%
to work through a lot of these details
 
05:19:23.948 --> 05:19:23.958 align:start position:0%
of what you're talking about and what
 
05:19:26.548 --> 05:19:26.558 align:start position:0%
the optomet are talking about in a way
 
05:19:31.190 --> 05:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
that it's not practical in a hearing yes
 
05:19:31.200 --> 05:19:33.430 align:start position:0%
that it's not practical in a hearing yes
sir

05:19:33.430 --> 05:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
sir
 
05:19:36.510 --> 05:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
representa thank you so this um look
 
05:19:38.830 --> 05:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
into expanding into the North country
 
05:19:42.470 --> 05:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
came as a result of the bill that we had
 
05:19:46.230 --> 05:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
last year yes ma'am and um follow up
 
05:19:50.590 --> 05:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
follow up I'm sorry follow up so um
 
05:19:52.110 --> 05:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
that's fine but that doesn't really
 
05:19:55.030 --> 05:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
address this bill this addresses this
 
05:19:58.390 --> 05:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
bill and I mean that doesn't address
 
05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:20:04.670 --> 05:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
349 and I thank the um
 
05:20:07.628 --> 05:20:07.638 align:start position:0%

attention but I also would like you to
 
05:20:14.788 --> 05:20:14.798 align:start position:0%
discuss or your share your thoughts on
 
05:20:18.150 --> 05:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
Poss what their training plans are on
 
05:20:22.070 --> 05:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
live um patients and proficiency and
 
05:20:24.830 --> 05:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
allowing them to also do what they have
 
05:20:27.548 --> 05:20:27.558 align:start position:0%
been trained to do yes ma'am this
 
05:20:30.510 --> 05:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
addresses what I believe is one argument
 
05:20:32.190 --> 05:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
this North Country project addresses
 
05:20:34.548 --> 05:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
what I believe is one argument for the
 
05:20:36.590 --> 05:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
bill that there is a lack of access and
 
05:20:39.788 --> 05:20:39.798 align:start position:0%
that this would solve access um even if
 
05:20:42.350 --> 05:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
pasted this is a minuscule portion of
 
05:20:44.350 --> 05:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
access to iare in the North Country so
 
05:20:46.230 --> 05:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
it's not really valid and this goes well
 
05:20:49.350 --> 05:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
beyond that I don't support the bill on
 
05:20:51.868 --> 05:20:51.878 align:start position:0%
the training purposes um I've had
 
05:20:55.030 --> 05:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
conversations um about what training
 
05:20:55.040 --> 05:20:56.350 align:start position:0%
conversations um about what training
really

05:20:56.350 --> 05:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:21:00.628 --> 05:21:00.638 align:start position:0%
is the bill says that when you guys pass
 
05:21:02.868 --> 05:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
this if it gets passed we'll take it to
 
05:21:04.868 --> 05:21:04.878 align:start position:0%
the board of Optometry and they'll
 
05:21:06.948 --> 05:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
decide what training is and it will
 
05:21:11.190 --> 05:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
include live cases right it could be one
 
05:21:14.070 --> 05:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
to Dr lean or representative lean's
 
05:21:17.110 --> 05:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
point it could be five it could be 10
 
05:21:19.628 --> 05:21:19.638 align:start position:0%
could be whatever they get to decide
 
05:21:21.788 --> 05:21:21.798 align:start position:0%
what it is right in the other states
 
05:21:23.948 --> 05:21:23.958 align:start position:0%
that it has been approved it's been a
 
05:21:27.390 --> 05:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
32h hour course um followed by maybe a
 
05:21:29.868 --> 05:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
live case and maybe not with in the
 
05:21:33.750 --> 05:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
other 10 states in the country um I do
 
05:21:36.350 --> 05:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
have Optometry residents at our program
 
05:21:38.590 --> 05:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
from the three Local Schools well two
 
05:21:40.110 --> 05:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
local um New England College of
 
05:21:42.350 --> 05:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
Optometry Pacific College of Optometry
 
05:21:45.590 --> 05:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
in Pennsylvania and the one in um in
 
05:21:50.750 --> 05:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
Memphis um and they get dactic training
 
05:21:52.230 --> 05:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
in these procedures so they've heard
 
05:21:53.430 --> 05:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
about them they've read about them
 
05:21:54.788 --> 05:21:54.798 align:start position:0%
they've seen videos about them they've
 
05:21:56.548 --> 05:21:56.558 align:start position:0%
learned about them in in in textbook
 
05:21:59.548 --> 05:21:59.558 align:start position:0%
setting right there's 24 Optometry
 
05:22:01.948 --> 05:22:01.958 align:start position:0%
schools in the country two are in states
 
05:22:04.110 --> 05:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
that allow this procedure these are not
 
05:22:06.670 --> 05:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
very frequent procedures right so the
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
concept that all 100% of the students
 
05:22:11.868 --> 05:22:11.878 align:start position:0%
from the 22 other Optometry schools are
 
05:22:14.830 --> 05:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
going to fly to the two schools and see
 
05:22:17.750 --> 05:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
and do enough live cases on live humans
 
05:22:20.150 --> 05:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
while they're there for a week a weekend
 
05:22:23.110 --> 05:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
whatever and come back and be trained
 
05:22:25.910 --> 05:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's not really mathematically feasible
 
05:22:29.628 --> 05:22:29.638 align:start position:0%
so the training just the training is is
 
05:22:32.230 --> 05:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
a hangup if you ask how I feel about the
 
05:22:33.670 --> 05:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
rest of
 
05:22:36.868 --> 05:22:36.878 align:start position:0%
it yes sir representative
 
05:22:40.270 --> 05:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you madam here so do you
 
05:22:42.548 --> 05:22:42.558 align:start position:0%
see this bill going forward with any
 
05:22:44.548 --> 05:22:44.558 align:start position:0%
changes to it
 
05:22:46.990 --> 05:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
maybe I I don't know what the changes
 
05:22:50.110 --> 05:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
would be um you're you're talking about
 
05:22:52.150 --> 05:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
can you you know if you're talking about
 
05:22:55.430 --> 05:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
can you train a person to do surgery yes
 
05:22:57.230 --> 05:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
sir right that those are called medical
 
05:22:59.548 --> 05:22:59.558 align:start position:0%
students we have a way to do it they're
 
05:23:02.270 --> 05:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
approved nationally accredited residency
 
05:23:04.270 --> 05:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
programs they take three to five years
 
05:23:07.110 --> 05:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
to complete and you get good surgeons at
 
05:23:09.708 --> 05:23:09.718 align:start position:0%
the end right the question here is is
 
05:23:12.070 --> 05:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
can you do that in a significantly
 
05:23:14.510 --> 05:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
truncated fashion and still deliver
 
05:23:17.430 --> 05:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
trained surgeons or
 
05:23:21.670 --> 05:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
not I thank you other questions
 
05:23:24.070 --> 05:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative Rees thank you madam
 
05:23:27.110 --> 05:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
chair um we heard in some of the earlier
 
05:23:29.910 --> 05:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
testimony that some of the waiting times
 
05:23:32.350 --> 05:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
were three three and a half months for
 
05:23:34.788 --> 05:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
surgery and that wasn't I don't believe
 
05:23:36.788 --> 05:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
only limited to the North Country so
 
05:23:39.830 --> 05:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
while I am quite enthusiastic about this
 
05:23:41.990 --> 05:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
as a solution uh traveling
 
05:23:44.948 --> 05:23:44.958 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist headed up to Berlin um
 
05:23:47.788 --> 05:23:47.798 align:start position:0%
I'm also concerned about bandwidth um
 
05:23:50.030 --> 05:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
across the state so I guess my question
 
05:23:53.628 --> 05:23:53.638 align:start position:0%
is if I could articulate it is if this
 
05:23:56.910 --> 05:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
were approved and if optometrist were
 
05:23:59.990 --> 05:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
able to take um and expand the bandwidth
 
05:24:02.750 --> 05:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
on these three surgeries would it allow
 
05:24:05.390 --> 05:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists to bring down weight
 
05:24:07.990 --> 05:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
times so heard about some painful eye uh
 
05:24:10.708 --> 05:24:10.718 align:start position:0%
situ ation and faster sounds better in
 
05:24:13.868 --> 05:24:13.878 align:start position:0%
those circumstances would that allow uh
 
05:24:16.548 --> 05:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
the opthalmologist to bring down average
 
05:24:18.390 --> 05:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
weight times and is that something I
 
05:24:20.990 --> 05:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
suppose double question here um that you
 
05:24:23.470 --> 05:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
are committed to addressing yes ma'am
 
05:24:26.390 --> 05:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um so Dr Blake is going to
 
05:24:28.628 --> 05:24:28.638 align:start position:0%
address what the real weight times are
 
05:24:31.150 --> 05:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
in in the other 90% of the state I can
 
05:24:33.150 --> 05:24:33.160 align:start position:0%
tell you from my I have a large practice
 
05:24:34.990 --> 05:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
out in the Sea Coast Area we've got five
 
05:24:37.190 --> 05:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
or six locations we do we have openings
 
05:24:39.788 --> 05:24:39.798 align:start position:0%
every week so there's really no waight
 
05:24:42.030 --> 05:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
at all it's more of a wait to get to see
 
05:24:43.948 --> 05:24:43.958 align:start position:0%
me for something as opposed to get to do
 
05:24:45.670 --> 05:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
these procedures CU this is a tiny
 
05:24:48.310 --> 05:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
little bit of what we do um I did
 
05:24:50.590 --> 05:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate the last testimony I will say
 
05:24:53.548 --> 05:24:53.558 align:start position:0%
though that having seen somebody most of
 
05:24:55.390 --> 05:24:55.400 align:start position:0%
these are non-urgent almost the vast
 
05:24:58.070 --> 05:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
majority 99 and a half% are non- Urgent
 
05:25:00.590 --> 05:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
right of the of that tiny little
 
05:25:02.670 --> 05:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
fraction that is urgent these people
 
05:25:05.628 --> 05:25:05.638 align:start position:0%
come in they're miserable they're
 
05:25:08.310 --> 05:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
vomiting they can't see they're scre
 
05:25:10.310 --> 05:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
screaming and crying you can't touch
 
05:25:12.150 --> 05:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
them the anesthetics don't work real
 
05:25:14.510 --> 05:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
good the corne is super emitus you can't
 
05:25:16.590 --> 05:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
see through it to do these procedures
 
05:25:18.310 --> 05:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
it's really really challenging for
 
05:25:21.310 --> 05:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
someone who's done thousands right I
 
05:25:24.070 --> 05:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
doubt that in this residency training
 
05:25:25.510 --> 05:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
program they're ever going to see
 
05:25:28.430 --> 05:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
someone who's looks like that yet alone
 
05:25:30.310 --> 05:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
get experience treating someone like
 
05:25:33.390 --> 05:25:33.400 align:start position:0%
that um I wouldn't start with a person
 
05:25:35.190 --> 05:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
like that you know if someone like that
 
05:25:37.030 --> 05:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
walked into my office and I'd done a
 
05:25:38.788 --> 05:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
handful of these things
 
05:25:40.590 --> 05:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
I would be getting someone else to help
 
05:25:42.788 --> 05:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
because they're super
 
05:25:45.030 --> 05:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
challenging thank
 
05:25:48.150 --> 05:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
you other question thank you very much
 
05:25:48.160 --> 05:25:49.190 align:start position:0%
you other question thank you very much
thank

05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:26:09.350 --> 05:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:12.110 --> 05:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair um members of
 
05:26:14.230 --> 05:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you um it's an honor
 
05:26:15.750 --> 05:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
for me to have the opportunity to speak
 
05:26:19.190 --> 05:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
to you today um I am Dr Angelique Sawyer
 
05:26:23.190 --> 05:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
of Infamous Berlin Fame apparently um I
 
05:26:25.548 --> 05:26:25.558 align:start position:0%
am originally from nasua uh I am an
 
05:26:27.628 --> 05:26:27.638 align:start position:0%
optometrist and I'm a practice Private
 
05:26:29.948 --> 05:26:29.958 align:start position:0%
Practice owner in the Far nural Far
 
05:26:32.430 --> 05:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
rural Northern parts of our great state
 
05:26:34.150 --> 05:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
having office locations in both North
 
05:26:36.670 --> 05:26:36.680 align:start position:0%
Conway and Berlin where I have practiced
 
05:26:38.830 --> 05:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
for the last 12 years
 
05:26:40.948 --> 05:26:40.958 align:start position:0%
um I am here today to speak in support
 
05:26:43.788 --> 05:26:43.798 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 349 because it is what my
 
05:26:45.510 --> 05:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
patients your constituents and the
 
05:26:47.190 --> 05:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire deserve in
 
05:26:49.788 --> 05:26:49.798 align:start position:0%
order to better meet their ey care needs
 
05:26:52.470 --> 05:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
before I go further into my prepared
 
05:26:56.750 --> 05:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
testimony I do want to um clarify some
 
05:26:58.430 --> 05:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
of the the questions that have already
 
05:27:01.830 --> 05:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
come forward yes and I would reiterate
 
05:27:03.470 --> 05:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt's comment that
 
05:27:05.590 --> 05:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
you should not read your testimony yes
 
05:27:07.590 --> 05:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
you should give us the highlights
 
05:27:11.548 --> 05:27:11.558 align:start position:0%
absolutely us so um one highlight is
 
05:27:17.470 --> 05:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
that yes I am in Berlin and um I uh am
 
05:27:20.070 --> 05:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
surprised to hear of this collaborative
 
05:27:22.470 --> 05:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
effort that not a single optometrist has
 
05:27:24.548 --> 05:27:24.558 align:start position:0%
been approached about for any of the
 
05:27:28.070 --> 05:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
North Country efforts um
 
05:27:31.150 --> 05:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
I uh have spoken to several to every
 
05:27:32.830 --> 05:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
optometrist that practices in the North
 
05:27:34.270 --> 05:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
country and not a single one has been
 
05:27:35.670 --> 05:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
approached about any of this
 
05:27:38.788 --> 05:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
collaborative care um they they speak
 
05:27:41.430 --> 05:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
about you know our relationships and
 
05:27:43.708 --> 05:27:43.718 align:start position:0%
that they're seeking to collaborate as
 
05:27:45.868 --> 05:27:45.878 align:start position:0%
um representative groa had asked and as
 
05:27:47.750 --> 05:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
um was put forward to us last year to
 
05:27:50.628 --> 05:27:50.638 align:start position:0%
sit down with them and attempt to find a
 
05:27:53.830 --> 05:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
compromise and I sat at that meeting and
 
05:27:57.548 --> 05:27:57.558 align:start position:0%
I said one single procedure anything
 
05:28:00.390 --> 05:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
what would it take for you to approve
 
05:28:02.390 --> 05:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
and for you to be comfortable and to not
 
05:28:04.190 --> 05:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
oppose having this happen What would the
 
05:28:06.390 --> 05:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
pathway be for an optometrist to get
 
05:28:09.750 --> 05:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
there crickets there is nothing that
 
05:28:12.150 --> 05:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
they will allow that will let us have
 
05:28:15.830 --> 05:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
this short of going to medical school
 
05:28:19.708 --> 05:28:19.718 align:start position:0%
because to them one procedure requires
 
05:28:21.708 --> 05:28:21.718 align:start position:0%
medical school don't know their their
 
05:28:24.110 --> 05:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
motives you can just speak please only
 
05:28:26.910 --> 05:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
testify to what they have said or done
 
05:28:29.230 --> 05:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
um they told me that if I wanted to go
 
05:28:31.628 --> 05:28:31.638 align:start position:0%
to medical school I could perform these
 
05:28:36.190 --> 05:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
procedures thank you thank you
 
05:28:39.270 --> 05:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
um they the question question was asked
 
05:28:39.280 --> 05:28:40.948 align:start position:0%
um they the question question was asked
about

05:28:40.948 --> 05:28:40.958 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:28:44.910 --> 05:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
um um live requirements I did my
 
05:28:47.110 --> 05:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
schooling in the state of Texas when I
 
05:28:49.750 --> 05:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
was in Texas um and still Texas is not a
 
05:28:52.150 --> 05:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
state that is allowed to do that um
 
05:28:53.628 --> 05:28:53.638 align:start position:0%
however I did my rotation through
 
05:28:56.350 --> 05:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma while I was in school I did
 
05:28:59.230 --> 05:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
these procedures on live patients we
 
05:29:00.948 --> 05:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
have doctors in the state of New
 
05:29:02.868 --> 05:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who have experienced
 
05:29:04.830 --> 05:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
performing these in other states that
 
05:29:07.110 --> 05:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
have come to New Hampshire how we get
 
05:29:09.150 --> 05:29:09.160 align:start position:0%
these procedures is starting with those
 
05:29:11.548 --> 05:29:11.558 align:start position:0%
cases starting with those providers who
 
05:29:14.990 --> 05:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
have live experience starting with um
 
05:29:16.990 --> 05:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
Educators who have taught these
 
05:29:20.150 --> 05:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
procedures and who then supervise New
 
05:29:22.070 --> 05:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire optometrists in performing
 
05:29:24.750 --> 05:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
these procedures that is how we get
 
05:29:27.670 --> 05:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
there we can't start doing these
 
05:29:29.230 --> 05:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
procedures in states where it's not
 
05:29:32.548 --> 05:29:32.558 align:start position:0%
allowed and so we can't get there if we
 
05:29:34.948 --> 05:29:34.958 align:start position:0%
don't have a pathway so that is where we
 
05:29:37.390 --> 05:29:37.400 align:start position:0%
are starting here we are starting with
 
05:29:39.350 --> 05:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
three procedur procures that every
 
05:29:42.110 --> 05:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
optometrist in the country is trained to
 
05:29:45.310 --> 05:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
do at every optometry school many of
 
05:29:47.868 --> 05:29:47.878 align:start position:0%
them have hands-on experience performing
 
05:29:50.070 --> 05:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
them on patients as part of their
 
05:29:53.310 --> 05:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
training by going to rotations in places
 
05:29:55.030 --> 05:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
where they can do those training those
 
05:29:58.510 --> 05:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
procedures on live patients for those
 
05:30:00.310 --> 05:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
that do not have that opportunity and
 
05:30:02.590 --> 05:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
some some do not have the interest some
 
05:30:05.150 --> 05:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
optometrists do not plan to do these
 
05:30:07.310 --> 05:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
procedures they do not plan to
 
05:30:10.150 --> 05:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
specialize and to to do this type of
 
05:30:12.628 --> 05:30:12.638 align:start position:0%
care and they will not pursue that there
 
05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
are many Optometry students who do not
 
05:30:17.628 --> 05:30:17.638 align:start position:0%
look to find seek out those rotations
 
05:30:18.910 --> 05:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
where they can get that clinical
 
05:30:20.430 --> 05:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
experience because it is not one of
 
05:30:22.830 --> 05:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
their priorities but for those that do
 
05:30:25.590 --> 05:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
we need to have a pathway to get there
 
05:30:27.670 --> 05:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
and that is where this is coming from we
 
05:30:30.070 --> 05:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
have had 12 states that have developed
 
05:30:31.788 --> 05:30:31.798 align:start position:0%
this pathway we're not Reinventing the
 
05:30:33.830 --> 05:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
wheel we have states that we will model
 
05:30:36.750 --> 05:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
model after the state of Kentucky their
 
05:30:38.830 --> 05:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
Board of Optometry has a proctoring
 
05:30:41.670 --> 05:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
program where established doctors
 
05:30:44.470 --> 05:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
oversee doctors that are looking to have
 
05:30:47.708 --> 05:30:47.718 align:start position:0%
live patient experience this is the
 
05:30:49.948 --> 05:30:49.958 align:start position:0%
model that our state board will be able
 
05:30:55.350 --> 05:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
to follow um the it is mandated in this
 
05:30:59.270 --> 05:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh law in in the bill HB 349 that live
 
05:31:01.708 --> 05:31:01.718 align:start position:0%
experience will be required and that
 
05:31:04.470 --> 05:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
will be done under supervision by those
 
05:31:07.470 --> 05:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
who are approved as educators of these
 
05:31:07.480 --> 05:31:08.628 align:start position:0%
who are approved as educators of these
procedures

05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
05:31:13.470 --> 05:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
years um the question came up about um
 
05:31:15.708 --> 05:31:15.718 align:start position:0%
you know the differences in in education
 
05:31:17.150 --> 05:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
it was brought forward you know that
 
05:31:19.750 --> 05:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
this was a um a 32-hour course the
 
05:31:22.230 --> 05:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
32-hour course is the refresher course
 
05:31:24.830 --> 05:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
that builds on our four years of
 
05:31:26.470 --> 05:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
doctorate Level Training where we are
 
05:31:28.230 --> 05:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
trained to do these
 
05:31:30.548 --> 05:31:30.558 align:start position:0%
procedures there as mentioned there are
 
05:31:32.868 --> 05:31:32.878 align:start position:0%
many procedures that up opthalmologists
 
05:31:34.948 --> 05:31:34.958 align:start position:0%
are trained to do that we are not and
 
05:31:36.788 --> 05:31:36.798 align:start position:0%
that we will have no intention of ever
 
05:31:39.310 --> 05:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
trying to do that is not within our
 
05:31:43.230 --> 05:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
training um in uh regards to the number
 
05:31:46.150 --> 05:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
of minimums we intend for that to be um
 
05:31:48.070 --> 05:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
decided by the board of Optometry in
 
05:31:52.030 --> 05:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
rule making but as a guideline the acgme
 
05:31:55.030 --> 05:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
that regulates Opthalmology residencies
 
05:31:57.750 --> 05:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
they have a minimum of five procedures
 
05:31:59.470 --> 05:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
four or five depending on which of the
 
05:32:00.670 --> 05:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
three laser procedures that we're
 
05:32:02.868 --> 05:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
talking about that is the minimum
 
05:32:04.948 --> 05:32:04.958 align:start position:0%
requirement for an
 
05:32:07.270 --> 05:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist that is a starting point
 
05:32:11.590 --> 05:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
where our board can go from in uh
 
05:32:14.708 --> 05:32:14.718 align:start position:0%
comparison to that there are over 200
 
05:32:17.948 --> 05:32:17.958 align:start position:0%
other minimums that they need to meet so
 
05:32:21.310 --> 05:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
14 laser procedures among 200 other
 
05:32:24.430 --> 05:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
surgeries in that Opthalmology
 
05:32:28.708 --> 05:32:28.718 align:start position:0%
residency so I do not need to go do an
 
05:32:30.948 --> 05:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology residency and do a minimum
 
05:32:33.990 --> 05:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
of all those other 200 procedures to do
 
05:32:35.948 --> 05:32:35.958 align:start position:0%
these three laser procedures these three
 
05:32:37.830 --> 05:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
laser procedures are ones that I have
 
05:32:39.788 --> 05:32:39.798 align:start position:0%
have been trained to do and that I have
 
05:32:42.150 --> 05:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
done safely and effectively on live
 
05:32:43.948 --> 05:32:43.958 align:start position:0%
patients in Oklahoma
 
05:32:47.990 --> 05:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
myself I have patients in Berlin who I
 
05:32:50.150 --> 05:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
cannot provide this care
 
05:32:54.910 --> 05:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
to um I have we I I'm thrilled to hear
 
05:32:58.070 --> 05:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
about this collaboration of bringing
 
05:33:01.230 --> 05:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
care to the the North Country um as
 
05:33:03.350 --> 05:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative groa pointed out this was
 
05:33:04.868 --> 05:33:04.878 align:start position:0%
not something that was ever brought up
 
05:33:10.150 --> 05:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
until we brought forward our um our bill
 
05:33:14.470 --> 05:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
last year and that is is not for lack of
 
05:33:17.030 --> 05:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
trying because as as in my written
 
05:33:19.590 --> 05:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
testimony um we had a provider who was
 
05:33:21.708 --> 05:33:21.718 align:start position:0%
traveling to the North Country who
 
05:33:23.830 --> 05:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
ceased to do so because it became too
 
05:33:26.350 --> 05:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
burdensome we've had AVH looking to
 
05:33:28.788 --> 05:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
bring provider to the North Country for
 
05:33:30.708 --> 05:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
years for three years they had a single
 
05:33:33.150 --> 05:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
person who came and spoke so I am
 
05:33:34.750 --> 05:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
thrilled if this is something that
 
05:33:38.070 --> 05:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
becomes successful um I hope that it
 
05:33:40.110 --> 05:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
will become a collaboration and this
 
05:33:42.430 --> 05:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
could become an opportunity where
 
05:33:44.548 --> 05:33:44.558 align:start position:0%
optometrists can receive training to
 
05:33:46.230 --> 05:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
then become certified to do these
 
05:33:48.548 --> 05:33:48.558 align:start position:0%
procedures because regardless of the
 
05:33:50.628 --> 05:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
access issue whether there were one or
 
05:33:53.310 --> 05:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
not this is within the training
 
05:33:55.590 --> 05:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
education and certification of Doctors
 
05:33:57.310 --> 05:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
of Optometry and that's what this bill
 
05:34:00.548 --> 05:34:00.558 align:start position:0%
is about my testimony and is almost
 
05:34:03.708 --> 05:34:03.718 align:start position:0%
entirely about access I have patient
 
05:34:07.310 --> 05:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
stories about you know they they mention
 
05:34:10.110 --> 05:34:10.120 align:start position:0%
that these these procedures are not um
 
05:34:11.830 --> 05:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
urgent they're not things that you know
 
05:34:14.070 --> 05:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
typically need to be done um very
 
05:34:16.590 --> 05:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
critically there's a a testim uh a
 
05:34:19.230 --> 05:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
patient story in my testimony here um of
 
05:34:21.628 --> 05:34:21.638 align:start position:0%
a patient who was blind in one eye and
 
05:34:24.350 --> 05:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
had to wait six weeks after going to see
 
05:34:26.390 --> 05:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
the opthalmologist and being told yes
 
05:34:28.110 --> 05:34:28.120 align:start position:0%
you need this laser procedure and then
 
05:34:30.030 --> 05:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
was sent back home and had to wait six
 
05:34:33.030 --> 05:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
more weeks to have that procedure done
 
05:34:34.910 --> 05:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
they were already blind in one eye and
 
05:34:36.948 --> 05:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
during those six weeks they cannot drive
 
05:34:38.628 --> 05:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
they cannot function
 
05:34:40.270 --> 05:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
and that is the level of care and this
 
05:34:41.948 --> 05:34:41.958 align:start position:0%
is somebody who is in Carol County
 
05:34:43.628 --> 05:34:43.638 align:start position:0%
because there is one opthalmologist in
 
05:34:45.470 --> 05:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
all of Carol County there is no
 
05:34:47.670 --> 05:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist in all of Coos County
 
05:34:49.310 --> 05:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
there are there are two counties that
 
05:34:50.948 --> 05:34:50.958 align:start position:0%
have no opthalmologists and there are
 
05:34:53.470 --> 05:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
two counties that have a single one
 
05:34:56.190 --> 05:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
there is an access issue but that is not
 
05:35:00.628 --> 05:35:00.638 align:start position:0%
why HB 349 should pass HB 349 should
 
05:35:03.190 --> 05:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
pass because these three specific
 
05:35:06.230 --> 05:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
procedures are within the education the
 
05:35:08.110 --> 05:35:08.120 align:start position:0%
certification and the training of
 
05:35:10.670 --> 05:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
Doctors of Optometry there has been
 
05:35:14.230 --> 05:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
proven in 12 States over 140,000
 
05:35:17.628 --> 05:35:17.638 align:start position:0%
procedures over more than 30 years of
 
05:35:21.670 --> 05:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
success and very low complication rate
 
05:35:22.990 --> 05:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
the question has been asked about
 
05:35:25.150 --> 05:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
neighboring states no there are no other
 
05:35:26.670 --> 05:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
states in New England right now that
 
05:35:29.830 --> 05:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
have this but if that is the requirement
 
05:35:31.510 --> 05:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
is to wait until other neighboring
 
05:35:33.910 --> 05:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
states have that we will find ourselves
 
05:35:36.548 --> 05:35:36.558 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the list Massachusetts
 
05:35:38.590 --> 05:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
and New York are at at the very bottom
 
05:35:41.708 --> 05:35:41.718 align:start position:0%
of the list for Optometric scope those
 
05:35:44.070 --> 05:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
are the two states that have continually
 
05:35:46.390 --> 05:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
been at the very bottom of where
 
05:35:48.548 --> 05:35:48.558 align:start position:0%
Optometry students look at what can I do
 
05:35:50.628 --> 05:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
as an optometrist New York and
 
05:35:53.190 --> 05:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts are on the bottom so if we
 
05:35:54.948 --> 05:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
would like to wait until those go
 
05:35:57.070 --> 05:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
forward so that we can do
 
05:35:59.230 --> 05:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
that that's not the New Hampshire that I
 
05:36:01.430 --> 05:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
grew up in and that I knew and that's
 
05:36:02.868 --> 05:36:02.878 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping is not the New Hampshire that
 
05:36:05.430 --> 05:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
I live in we have 12 States whether they
 
05:36:07.750 --> 05:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
are neighboring or not that have done
 
05:36:10.310 --> 05:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
this successfully that have a track
 
05:36:13.270 --> 05:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
record of safety we are not proposing
 
05:36:15.350 --> 05:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
any sort of reduced quality of care in
 
05:36:17.470 --> 05:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
order to save on health care costs or in
 
05:36:20.830 --> 05:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
quarter to increase access we are
 
05:36:23.990 --> 05:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
looking to expand at the same level of
 
05:36:25.948 --> 05:36:25.958 align:start position:0%
quality care and that is what has been
 
05:36:29.470 --> 05:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
proven by the track record of 30 years
 
05:36:31.788 --> 05:36:31.798 align:start position:0%
of optometrists doing these laser
 
05:36:33.788 --> 05:36:33.798 align:start position:0%
procedures I'm sure there's more I plan
 
05:36:36.670 --> 05:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
to say but that's all I got right now
 
05:36:40.990 --> 05:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
 
05:36:44.110 --> 05:36:44.120 align:start position:0%
Schmidt so my eternal infernal question
 
05:36:47.030 --> 05:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
is can you come to the subcommittee
 
05:36:50.190 --> 05:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
because we need this kind of specificity
 
05:36:52.310 --> 05:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
to move this forward absolutely I was
 
05:36:53.670 --> 05:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
there last year I'll be happy to do it
 
05:36:56.030 --> 05:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
again thank you very much thank you and
 
05:36:58.430 --> 05:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
other questions seeing none thank you
 
05:37:00.548 --> 05:37:00.558 align:start position:0%
for your
 
05:37:00.558 --> 05:37:02.150 align:start position:0%
for your
testimony

05:37:02.150 --> 05:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:37:05.470 --> 05:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
okay all the remaining uh people who
 
05:37:07.868 --> 05:37:07.878 align:start position:0%
have filled out cards are in opposition
 
05:37:10.270 --> 05:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
so I would hope you wouldn't be careful
 
05:37:18.750 --> 05:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:22.230 --> 05:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
smid thank you madam chair I'm uh here
 
05:37:24.030 --> 05:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
as just a concerned member of the public
 
05:37:26.788 --> 05:37:26.798 align:start position:0%
I am not a medical doctor nor am I an
 
05:37:28.590 --> 05:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
optometrist uh I would just like to
 
05:37:30.470 --> 05:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
respond to some things that I heard
 
05:37:34.030 --> 05:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
earlier in the testimony so one concern
 
05:37:35.590 --> 05:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
that I have just looking at the bill is
 
05:37:39.548 --> 05:37:39.558 align:start position:0%
if these are op omrs that want to
 
05:37:41.990 --> 05:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
practice opthalmological
 
05:37:44.628 --> 05:37:44.638 align:start position:0%
procedures I question why they don't
 
05:37:46.948 --> 05:37:46.958 align:start position:0%
just choose to become
 
05:37:50.230 --> 05:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists from the get-go and one
 
05:37:54.190 --> 05:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
of the problems I have is if we start
 
05:37:56.190 --> 05:37:56.200 align:start position:0%
Sor if we start cheapening the
 
05:37:59.510 --> 05:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
profession of uh opthomology and allow
 
05:38:00.910 --> 05:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
optometrist to practice these
 
05:38:03.470 --> 05:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
opthalmological procedures it provides a
 
05:38:05.510 --> 05:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
negative pressure on the training of
 
05:38:07.510 --> 05:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists in the future because
 
05:38:08.788 --> 05:38:08.798 align:start position:0%
why would you become an opthalmologist
 
05:38:10.548 --> 05:38:10.558 align:start position:0%
go through med school put yourself
 
05:38:14.470 --> 05:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
through uh what I heard was a 6year plus
 
05:38:17.110 --> 05:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
post uh Residency program why would you
 
05:38:18.708 --> 05:38:18.718 align:start position:0%
go through that if you can just study
 
05:38:21.510 --> 05:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
Optometry and then practice opical
 
05:38:24.070 --> 05:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
procedures just because of the
 
05:38:26.868 --> 05:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
legislate it does not make sense to me
 
05:38:29.708 --> 05:38:29.718 align:start position:0%
uh and I would not feel comfortable not
 
05:38:31.030 --> 05:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
knowing the difference between the two
 
05:38:32.670 --> 05:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
because again the words are very similar
 
05:38:34.948 --> 05:38:34.958 align:start position:0%
Optometry and opthomology uh if I was
 
05:38:37.430 --> 05:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
just a Layman going to see a doctor and
 
05:38:38.590 --> 05:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
and I did not know the two I would feel
 
05:38:41.548 --> 05:38:41.558 align:start position:0%
very uncomfortable learning that the
 
05:38:43.030 --> 05:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
profession uh professional that I had
 
05:38:46.590 --> 05:38:46.600 align:start position:0%
chosen to see uh did not have the
 
05:38:49.150 --> 05:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
training that I believed when walking
 
05:38:51.390 --> 05:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
into that office and for many people
 
05:38:53.788 --> 05:38:53.798 align:start position:0%
they cannot make that distinction uh
 
05:38:55.270 --> 05:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
because they just don't have time to
 
05:38:57.750 --> 05:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
learn the difference between various
 
05:39:03.990 --> 05:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:07.548 --> 05:39:07.558 align:start position:0%
Fields I would like to end by saying if
 
05:39:10.830 --> 05:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
as I heard State statutes determine uh
 
05:39:12.868 --> 05:39:12.878 align:start position:0%
opthalmological practices and Optometric
 
05:39:12.878 --> 05:39:13.948 align:start position:0%
opthalmological practices and Optometric
prac

05:39:13.948 --> 05:39:13.958 align:start position:0%
prac
 
05:39:16.110 --> 05:39:16.120 align:start position:0%
practices this is unique in this
 
05:39:18.590 --> 05:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
profession however if other professions
 
05:39:20.910 --> 05:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
were in similar stances I would not
 
05:39:23.430 --> 05:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
expect that the state allow flight
 
05:39:26.830 --> 05:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
attendance to uh Captain airplanes or
 
05:39:29.670 --> 05:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
any such other uh cross within a
 
05:39:31.750 --> 05:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
profession that we have specific
 
05:39:34.750 --> 05:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
occupations that tie back to uh specific
 
05:39:37.910 --> 05:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
delineations of uh study and and
 
05:39:42.788 --> 05:39:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:47.430 --> 05:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
care also I'd like to note that when uh
 
05:39:50.350 --> 05:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
it was asked why Massachusetts was not
 
05:39:51.868 --> 05:39:51.878 align:start position:0%
leading the charge on allowing
 
05:39:53.868 --> 05:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
optometrist to practice these opical
 
05:39:56.190 --> 05:39:56.200 align:start position:0%
procedures it was said they have a large
 
05:39:58.230 --> 05:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
medical community that does not support
 
05:40:00.430 --> 05:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
it I do think that we should follow the
 
05:40:02.270 --> 05:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations of this large medical
 
05:40:04.990 --> 05:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
community and also not support it thank
 
05:40:07.548 --> 05:40:07.558 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony
 
05:40:09.150 --> 05:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
representative Leon has a question if
 
05:40:11.468 --> 05:40:11.478 align:start position:0%
you would here to answer it oh yes thank
 
05:40:12.910 --> 05:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
you your testimony has definitely been
 
05:40:15.510 --> 05:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
impressive um just with your know level
 
05:40:17.910 --> 05:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
of detail are you do you have any family
 
05:40:20.468 --> 05:40:20.478 align:start position:0%
members that are in this area uh yes my
 
05:40:22.670 --> 05:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
dad is a practicing opthamologist okay
 
05:40:24.708 --> 05:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
that's why you get this area so much
 
05:40:24.718 --> 05:40:26.070 align:start position:0%
that's why you get this area so much
thank

05:40:26.070 --> 05:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:40:29.390 --> 05:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
you uh any other questions I don't see
 
05:40:32.270 --> 05:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
any thank you thank
 
05:40:42.350 --> 05:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:44.390 --> 05:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
I'm Timothy Blake I'm an opthalmologist
 
05:40:49.030 --> 05:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
in nashwa uh I'm in opposition to HB 349
 
05:40:50.430 --> 05:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the committee's attention
 
05:40:52.430 --> 05:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
this afternoon I'm going to touch on a
 
05:40:55.628 --> 05:40:55.638 align:start position:0%
couple points regarding access uh New
 
05:40:57.750 --> 05:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is favorably positioned
 
05:40:59.430 --> 05:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
compared to the average State regarding
 
05:41:02.070 --> 05:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
Drive times to an opthalmologist over
 
05:41:04.468 --> 05:41:04.478 align:start position:0%
90% of New Hampshire residents live
 
05:41:06.390 --> 05:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
within a 30 minute drive to an
 
05:41:06.400 --> 05:41:09.670 align:start position:0%
within a 30 minute drive to an
opthalmologist

05:41:09.670 --> 05:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:12.270 --> 05:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
furthermore uh every optometry office
 
05:41:14.310 --> 05:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
that serves New Hampshire Medicare
 
05:41:17.110 --> 05:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
patients Falls within a 30 minute a 30
 
05:41:19.948 --> 05:41:19.958 align:start position:0%
mile catchman area of an opthalmologist
 
05:41:22.788 --> 05:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
office this is intuitive NASA is a small
 
05:41:25.150 --> 05:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
state by area the seventh smallest in
 
05:41:28.788 --> 05:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
the union the states where legislator
 
05:41:30.750 --> 05:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
have experimented with authorizing
 
05:41:32.948 --> 05:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
optometrist laser ey surgery privileges
 
05:41:34.948 --> 05:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
are the states with the lowest
 
05:41:37.230 --> 05:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
population density Alaska and wyom
 
05:41:39.150 --> 05:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
filing for example are ranked 50th and
 
05:41:41.830 --> 05:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
49th respectively in Residence per
 
05:41:44.350 --> 05:41:44.360 align:start position:0%
square mile New Hampshire has more than
 
05:41:46.110 --> 05:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
twice the population density of the
 
05:41:48.670 --> 05:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
average State allowing optometrist Las

05:41:53.150 --> 05:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
surgery the Bureau of laser of Labor
 
05:41:56.030 --> 05:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
Statistics ranks New Hampshire third in
 
05:41:59.230 --> 05:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
the country in Opthalmology employment
 
05:42:00.830 --> 05:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
per 1,000
 
05:42:03.548 --> 05:42:03.558 align:start position:0%
jobs I'm not this is in your your packet
 
05:42:05.670 --> 05:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
by the way I'm not a demographer but I
 
05:42:07.590 --> 05:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
believe one could use this as a stand in
 
05:42:10.788 --> 05:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
for relative opthalmologist per

05:42:34.788 --> 05:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
according to surveys with 75%
 
05:42:38.468 --> 05:42:38.478 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists responding and and the
 
05:42:42.110 --> 05:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
full survey results also are in your
 
05:42:46.350 --> 05:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
packet I'd also like to um make a note
 
05:42:49.150 --> 05:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
that uh one of the other testifiers
 
05:42:52.788 --> 05:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
briefly did uh regarding access and
 
05:42:54.708 --> 05:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
affordability uh increasing the number
 
05:42:56.948 --> 05:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
of providers for a medical service does
 
05:43:00.468 --> 05:43:00.478 align:start position:0%
not decrease the cost to patients there
 
05:43:02.910 --> 05:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
is no price demand curve for Medicare
 
05:43:05.548 --> 05:43:05.558 align:start position:0%
covered Services the cost to patients
 
05:43:07.628 --> 05:43:07.638 align:start position:0%
and insurers is flat
 
05:43:10.110 --> 05:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
and dependent basically on Medicare
 
05:43:13.350 --> 05:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:15.948 --> 05:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
surgery does the number of patients in a
 
05:43:19.468 --> 05:43:19.478 align:start position:0%
rural location support the number needed
 
05:43:22.230 --> 05:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
to treat to achieve an adequate and
 
05:43:23.910 --> 05:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
proficient skill
 
05:43:26.830 --> 05:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
set studies in the surgical literature
 
05:43:28.230 --> 05:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that one of the most
 
05:43:30.830 --> 05:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
important predictors of surgical
 
05:43:34.070 --> 05:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
complications is low surgical volume
 
05:43:36.230 --> 05:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
surgeons who do fewer surgeries than a
 
05:43:44.910 --> 05:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:46.990 --> 05:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
complications and I'll I'll touch on one
 
05:43:51.468 --> 05:43:51.478 align:start position:0%
final Point uh it's it's been brought up
 
05:43:54.750 --> 05:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
this year and on occasion last
 
05:43:57.670 --> 05:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
year uh many professions can lean
 
05:44:00.910 --> 05:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
heavily on onth job training that occurs
 
05:44:03.190 --> 05:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
after schooling however laser eye
 
05:44:05.670 --> 05:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
surgery training needs to address the
 
05:44:08.390 --> 05:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
very difficult problem of all surgery
 
05:44:11.270 --> 05:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
training the problem is reconciling
 
05:44:14.628 --> 05:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
these two conflicting fla facts new
 
05:44:17.510 --> 05:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
trainees will make mistakes and there is
 
05:44:20.628 --> 05:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
zero tolerance for mistakes in
 
05:44:23.468 --> 05:44:23.478 align:start position:0%
surgery this difficult problem is why on
 
05:44:26.750 --> 05:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
the PubMed database the topic surgical
 
05:44:29.070 --> 05:44:29.080 align:start position:0%

peer-reviewed entries I'm not a
 
05:44:34.270 --> 05:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
residency director but I would describe
 
05:44:35.910 --> 05:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
surgical training as slow and
 
05:44:35.920 --> 05:44:37.430 align:start position:0%

05:44:57.510 --> 05:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
not have the skill sets and despite the

strong tendency of self-denial in a

05:45:11.670 --> 05:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
we have heard here today that access may

not be the important issue that it is
 
05:45:15.390 --> 05:45:15.400 align:start position:0%

the best interest of Public Health thank
 
05:46:17.110 --> 05:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
you questions representative sellers you
 
05:46:21.590 --> 05:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
have a question thank you madam chair uh
 
05:46:25.510 --> 05:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
question is do you do laser laser
 
05:46:28.948 --> 05:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
surgeries yes follow up follow and the
 
05:46:30.750 --> 05:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
second part of that is when you were in
 
05:46:33.230 --> 05:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
training do you make
 
05:46:37.468 --> 05:46:37.478 align:start position:0%
mistakes uh not on live patients okay
 
05:46:39.190 --> 05:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
but you mentioned mistakes and everybody
 
05:46:41.670 --> 05:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
makes them that's why I was
 
05:46:41.680 --> 05:46:51.750 align:start position:0%
makes them that's why I was
asking

05:46:51.750 --> 05:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:54.070 --> 05:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
please I'm just being clarified because
 
05:46:57.590 --> 05:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
the word every everyone and not that
 
05:47:00.190 --> 05:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
just means it includes a lot everyone
 
05:47:03.468 --> 05:47:03.478 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you do you need
 
05:47:09.670 --> 05:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:11.590 --> 05:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
I think thought you were perfectly clear
 
05:47:16.708 --> 05:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:19.350 --> 05:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank
 
05:47:50.310 --> 05:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:52.548 --> 05:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and um members of
 
05:47:55.350 --> 05:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
the Edna committee for allowing me to
 
05:47:58.708 --> 05:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill HB HB
 
05:48:02.310 --> 05:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
349 I am retired orp surgeon hav been
 
05:48:04.390 --> 05:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
practiced in this state for about 40
 
05:48:07.110 --> 05:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
years I'm also a past member of the
 
05:48:08.390 --> 05:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives here in New
 
05:48:10.230 --> 05:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire serving on ways and means as
 
05:48:13.868 --> 05:48:13.878 align:start position:0%
well as HHS I'm here to
 
05:48:17.230 --> 05:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
testify as strongly as I can against uh
 
05:48:20.788 --> 05:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
HB uh 349 several here have given
 
05:48:22.788 --> 05:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
testimony and I won't reiterate this and
 
05:48:25.230 --> 05:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
for the sake of uh what representative
 
05:48:28.190 --> 05:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
Smidt uh asked I will not try to read my
 
05:48:30.430 --> 05:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
testimony but we'll try to summarize it
 
05:48:34.070 --> 05:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um some people here will
 
05:48:37.030 --> 05:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
testify that this bill is identical to
 
05:48:39.070 --> 05:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
what happened last year and years before
 
05:48:42.070 --> 05:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
that and failed twice uh others will
 
05:48:45.350 --> 05:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
basically state that um uh they heard
 
05:48:47.390 --> 05:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
testimony that there was reporting from
 
05:48:49.788 --> 05:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
the optom optometrist own Review
 
05:48:51.030 --> 05:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
Committee that there were no
 
05:48:53.110 --> 05:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
complications where we heard somebody
 
05:48:55.750 --> 05:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
last year uh testify that somebody
 
05:48:58.390 --> 05:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
suffered from significant blindness
 
05:49:00.910 --> 05:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
after a procedure done by an
 
05:49:00.920 --> 05:49:03.468 align:start position:0%
after a procedure done by an
optometrist

05:49:03.468 --> 05:49:03.478 align:start position:0%
optometrist
 
05:49:06.110 --> 05:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
um also that the board of Optometry
 
05:49:08.468 --> 05:49:08.478 align:start position:0%
would decide decide who would have the
 
05:49:10.070 --> 05:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
credentials to uh perform these
 
05:49:13.150 --> 05:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
surgeries but failed to recognize that
 
05:49:16.990 --> 05:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
um uh doing a weekend course on not live
 
05:49:18.750 --> 05:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
patients does not really compare to the
 
05:49:21.270 --> 05:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
multiple years that it takes to become a
 
05:49:23.830 --> 05:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
surgeon I'll not reiterate those
 
05:49:26.830 --> 05:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
testimonies um but I cannot stress hard
 
05:49:29.350 --> 05:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
more than enough that this is simply a
 
05:49:31.750 --> 05:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
quality of care issue as far as I'm
 
05:49:34.310 --> 05:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
concerned this is not a Turf battle I'm
 
05:49:36.830 --> 05:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
an orthopedic surgeon uh I'm not an
 
05:49:39.430 --> 05:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
optomologist I'm not an optometrist I'm
 
05:49:41.868 --> 05:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
an orthopedic surgeon but I can easily
 
05:49:44.590 --> 05:49:44.600 align:start position:0%
relate to the practice of surgery that
 
05:49:46.310 --> 05:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh in the tension that may exist between
 
05:49:48.830 --> 05:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
opthamologists and optometrists this is
 
05:49:51.468 --> 05:49:51.478 align:start position:0%
really not a Turf battle uh I been
 
05:49:53.830 --> 05:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
involved in Turf battles before in the
 
05:49:56.628 --> 05:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
state Turf battles sometimes would in
 
05:49:59.110 --> 05:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
Center in my specialty who would do hand
 
05:50:02.948 --> 05:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
surgery would it be um plastic surgeons
 
05:50:05.990 --> 05:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
general surgeons orthopedic surgeons we
 
05:50:07.750 --> 05:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
basically came to an agreement that if
 
05:50:09.468 --> 05:50:09.478 align:start position:0%
you were board certified if you have
 
05:50:11.788 --> 05:50:11.798 align:start position:0%
done the appropriate training that you
 
05:50:13.670 --> 05:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
you could probably do the hand surgery
 
05:50:16.270 --> 05:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
appropriately and frankly it was welcome
 
05:50:18.110 --> 05:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
because it was more than enough to go
 
05:50:18.120 --> 05:50:20.910 align:start position:0%
because it was more than enough to go
around

05:50:20.910 --> 05:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
around
 
05:50:24.150 --> 05:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
um but I do know what it takes to be a
 
05:50:27.230 --> 05:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
surgeon um I know the required training
 
05:50:31.788 --> 05:50:31.798 align:start position:0%
to do so uh weekend courses limited to
 
05:50:34.670 --> 05:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh patients that are not live is simply
 
05:50:36.830 --> 05:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
not adequate
 
05:50:38.510 --> 05:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
surgical residencies can take anywhere
 
05:50:41.628 --> 05:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
from six to 10 years um Orthopedics is
 
05:50:43.948 --> 05:50:43.958 align:start position:0%
relatively simple we are basically you
 
05:50:47.868 --> 05:50:47.878 align:start position:0%
know Cabinetry makers on the human body
 
05:50:50.830 --> 05:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
um but having said that that comes after
 
05:50:52.788 --> 05:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
four years of med school five years of
 
05:50:55.310 --> 05:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
surgical training another year of
 
05:50:59.830 --> 05:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
Fellowship um we work side by side with
 
05:51:02.910 --> 05:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
trained surgeons experienced surgeons
 
05:51:06.590 --> 05:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
day and night to to learn our our trade
 
05:51:08.350 --> 05:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
having optometrist do laser surgery
 
05:51:10.230 --> 05:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
would be akin to having the occupational
 
05:51:12.788 --> 05:51:12.798 align:start position:0%
therapist do your hand surgery or the
 
05:51:16.270 --> 05:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
physical therapist to do your knee scope
 
05:51:18.510 --> 05:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
they have doctors of physical therapy
 
05:51:21.390 --> 05:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
that is one of the um uh titles that
 
05:51:23.310 --> 05:51:23.320 align:start position:0%
they can carry doctor of physical
 
05:51:25.510 --> 05:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
therapy but they do not do surgery they
 
05:51:29.468 --> 05:51:29.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:31.990 --> 05:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
reason surgical training is really just
 
05:51:35.510 --> 05:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
not an exercise in the O it's learning
 
05:51:38.708 --> 05:51:38.718 align:start position:0%
indications it's learning um
 
05:51:40.948 --> 05:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking about who goes to the or
 
05:51:43.110 --> 05:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
who does not I would estimate that
 
05:51:45.468 --> 05:51:45.478 align:start position:0%
probably 90% of the patients I saw in
 
05:51:48.670 --> 05:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
the clinic did not go to surgery but 10%
 
05:51:51.590 --> 05:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
probably did uh it's about how to take
 
05:51:53.350 --> 05:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
care of complications how to recognize
 
05:51:55.750 --> 05:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
complications and how to deal with them
 
05:51:57.110 --> 05:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
the surgical training that we went
 
05:52:00.548 --> 05:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
through took up to probably 10 years and
 
05:52:04.270 --> 05:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
as a result um we were equipped to
 
05:52:06.190 --> 05:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
handle many of the problems that we saw
 
05:52:08.030 --> 05:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
on the the outside I can't tell you how
 
05:52:09.948 --> 05:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
many times I had residence I was a
 
05:52:11.430 --> 05:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
residency director at one point at
 
05:52:13.670 --> 05:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth as well I was there for about
 
05:52:15.830 --> 05:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
10 years as a director of orthopedic
 
05:52:18.150 --> 05:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
surgery I can't tell you how many times
 
05:52:20.390 --> 05:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
I would have a resident call a past
 
05:52:23.868 --> 05:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
resident call years later and say murf
 
05:52:25.310 --> 05:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing something that I have never
 
05:52:27.708 --> 05:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
seen before and I would remind
 
05:52:30.310 --> 05:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
them that during the training they may
 
05:52:32.788 --> 05:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
have not seen that specific case but
 
05:52:34.270 --> 05:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
during the training they had the
 
05:52:36.670 --> 05:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
principles taught to them so that that
 
05:52:38.868 --> 05:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
they applied the appropriate principles
 
05:52:40.788 --> 05:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
they could take care of the cases and
 
05:52:43.708 --> 05:52:43.718 align:start position:0%
nearly 100% of the time they could so
 
05:52:45.590 --> 05:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
surgical training is not just a
 
05:52:48.070 --> 05:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
technical exercise I would I would
 
05:52:51.150 --> 05:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
mention that the um the bill that's
 
05:52:53.910 --> 05:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
before you mentions laser procedures
 
05:52:55.868 --> 05:52:55.878 align:start position:0%
don't be mistaken these are laser
 
05:52:58.350 --> 05:52:58.360 align:start position:0%
surgeries these are surgical
 
05:53:02.910 --> 05:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
procedures this is truly not a Turf
 
05:53:04.948 --> 05:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
battle between the optometrist and the
 
05:53:04.958 --> 05:53:08.270 align:start position:0%
battle between the optometrist and the
optomologist

05:53:08.270 --> 05:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:10.708 --> 05:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
it is because of professional education
 
05:53:12.708 --> 05:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
patient safety and quality of care that
 
05:53:14.990 --> 05:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
is important it's why surgical
 
05:53:17.548 --> 05:53:17.558 align:start position:0%
residencies take so long so our
 
05:53:19.670 --> 05:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
objection my objection to this bill is
 
05:53:21.830 --> 05:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
not as a surgeon needing to maintain any
 
05:53:23.150 --> 05:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
ego I am
 
05:53:26.430 --> 05:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
retired um it is not a Turf Battle of US
 
05:53:29.590 --> 05:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
versus them it is not about access to
 
05:53:32.270 --> 05:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
care I've heard about access before I I
 
05:53:34.670 --> 05:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
totally agree that there is an access
 
05:53:36.628 --> 05:53:36.638 align:start position:0%
problem in healthcare across the the
 
05:53:38.590 --> 05:53:38.600 align:start position:0%
country it's in primary care it's in
 
05:53:40.990 --> 05:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
Orthopedics it's in in any specialty you
 
05:53:44.150 --> 05:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
mention it's also in the trades it's in
 
05:53:46.350 --> 05:53:46.360 align:start position:0%
the electricians and the plumbers if you
 
05:53:48.430 --> 05:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
do not have the appropriate you expect
 
05:53:49.548 --> 05:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
when you have somebody come to your
 
05:53:50.948 --> 05:53:50.958 align:start position:0%
house to take care of the plumbing that
 
05:53:52.708 --> 05:53:52.718 align:start position:0%
they are certified in what they do when
 
05:53:55.830 --> 05:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
you go to the hospital you expect that
 
05:53:57.230 --> 05:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
the people that are credentialed and
 
05:53:59.830 --> 05:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
privileged there have the the right to
 
05:54:01.548 --> 05:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
do the surgery that they intend to do on
 
05:54:05.590 --> 05:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
you so I I wouldn't argue I I would not
 
05:54:08.830 --> 05:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
argue that is not a problem but this is
 
05:54:12.750 --> 05:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
simply a quality of care issue surgeons
 
05:54:14.430 --> 05:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
are trained to take care of surgical
 
05:54:17.590 --> 05:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
problems these are surgeries and I I
 
05:54:22.030 --> 05:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
would just say that um I would urge you
 
05:54:23.548 --> 05:54:23.558 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to come into
 
05:54:25.868 --> 05:54:25.878 align:start position:0%
subcommittees to give you more technical
 
05:54:27.670 --> 05:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
details though I'm not an
 
05:54:29.468 --> 05:54:29.478 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist but I would urge you to
 
05:54:32.270 --> 05:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
itl this bill because it really is about
 
05:54:34.948 --> 05:54:34.958 align:start position:0%
patient safety quality of care
 
05:54:37.150 --> 05:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
professional credentialing
 
05:54:38.948 --> 05:54:38.958 align:start position:0%
uh practice scope that we were talking
 
05:54:41.670 --> 05:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
about here thank you thank you for the
 
05:54:43.788 --> 05:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Leon thank you
 
05:54:45.430 --> 05:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair and very very good to see
 
05:54:46.628 --> 05:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
you again we're missing you in the
 
05:54:50.230 --> 05:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
legislature this year um my question you
 
05:54:51.590 --> 05:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
actually touched upon what I've been
 
05:54:53.628 --> 05:54:53.638 align:start position:0%
thinking been wondering about throughout
 
05:54:56.350 --> 05:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
this whole hearing um here we have an
 
05:54:58.788 --> 05:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
issue of putting certain procedures into
 
05:55:02.548 --> 05:55:02.558 align:start position:0%
the statutes but in surgery is it the
 
05:55:04.270 --> 05:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
statutes that prevent an orthopedic
 
05:55:06.510 --> 05:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
surgeon from performing cardiac surgery
 
05:55:08.510 --> 05:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
is that the Board of Medicine that is
 
05:55:10.310 --> 05:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
actually probably done at the hospital
 
05:55:12.948 --> 05:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
level so when you think about it when we
 
05:55:15.110 --> 05:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
have when we go to a hospital to
 
05:55:17.350 --> 05:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
practice they have a credentialing
 
05:55:18.708 --> 05:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
committee and they have a privileging
 
05:55:20.510 --> 05:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
committee the credentialing committee
 
05:55:21.868 --> 05:55:21.878 align:start position:0%
basically says that you have the
 
05:55:23.510 --> 05:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
credentials that you talk about you went
 
05:55:24.868 --> 05:55:24.878 align:start position:0%
to med school you did your surgical
 
05:55:27.030 --> 05:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
residency you did your fellowship Etc
 
05:55:28.110 --> 05:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
you passed your
 
05:55:31.270 --> 05:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
boards the privileging is what I spent
 
05:55:34.430 --> 05:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
many hours on the side of the bed
 
05:55:37.270 --> 05:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
operating on Open Hearts on brain
 
05:55:40.270 --> 05:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
surgery other surgical subsp Specialties
 
05:55:42.750 --> 05:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
general surgery I am not qualified and
 
05:55:44.510 --> 05:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
was never qualified after my training to
 
05:55:46.510 --> 05:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
do that that is where the privileging
 
05:55:48.590 --> 05:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
comes in so really it is up to the
 
05:55:51.750 --> 05:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals to decide where and who what
 
05:55:53.990 --> 05:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
you should be doing and in fact even
 
05:55:56.708 --> 05:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
within the bread of Orthopedics I had to
 
05:56:00.110 --> 05:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
limit what I I took on as my privileged
 
05:56:02.910 --> 05:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
case load that I could do because I'm
 
05:56:05.510 --> 05:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
not qualified to do some of the stuff
 
05:56:07.990 --> 05:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
that you know I started off in general
 
05:56:10.430 --> 05:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
Orthopedics I did spine surgery I did
 
05:56:12.910 --> 05:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
joint surgery I did a lot of trauma But
 
05:56:15.548 --> 05:56:15.558 align:start position:0%
as time went on I retracted back to my
 
05:56:17.830 --> 05:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
Subs specialy of hand surgery and
 
05:56:19.310 --> 05:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
frankly I did not feel like I was
 
05:56:21.628 --> 05:56:21.638 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing so I checked off the
 
05:56:23.310 --> 05:56:23.320 align:start position:0%
box that I'm not qualified so it's at
 
05:56:25.030 --> 05:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
the hospital level really that it should
 
05:56:28.070 --> 05:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
be done thank you follow and as a
 
05:56:29.910 --> 05:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
followup that's done at the hospital
 
05:56:31.430 --> 05:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
level but things like the hospital
 
05:56:33.750 --> 05:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
accreditation really move that more to
 
05:56:35.788 --> 05:56:35.798 align:start position:0%
National standards around who should be
 
05:56:38.070 --> 05:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
performing what procedures correct
 
05:56:41.868 --> 05:56:41.878 align:start position:0%
that's true thank you other questions
 
05:56:43.548 --> 05:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:56:58.030 --> 05:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:00.270 --> 05:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
Nagels thank you Madame chairman this
 
05:57:02.310 --> 05:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
has been an entertaining day we go from
 
05:57:07.948 --> 05:57:07.958 align:start position:0%
Cannabis to psychology to opom Tre I'm
 
05:57:11.990 --> 05:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
David Nagel I'm a physician I'm also
 
05:57:12.000 --> 05:57:13.830 align:start position:0%
David Nagel I'm a physician I'm also
representative

05:57:13.830 --> 05:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:57:13.840 --> 05:57:16.150 align:start position:0%
representative
um

05:57:16.150 --> 05:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:19.190 --> 05:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
um and I I'll leave it at that I am a
 
05:57:21.788 --> 05:57:21.798 align:start position:0%
nonsurgeon um I don't really want to
 
05:57:24.390 --> 05:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
repeat a lot of what Dr Murphy just said
 
05:57:26.830 --> 05:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
but I was honored last year to be asked
 
05:57:28.788 --> 05:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
on that subcommittee thing that we kind
 
05:57:32.708 --> 05:57:32.718 align:start position:0%
of looked at this whole process and it
 
05:57:34.910 --> 05:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
was really neat that the two gentlemen
 
05:57:37.150 --> 05:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
that teach these elect and how to do
 
05:57:38.910 --> 05:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
these procedures were present so that we
 
05:57:41.788 --> 05:57:41.798 align:start position:0%
were able to ask them questions and I
 
05:57:43.750 --> 05:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
think that's where things really started
 
05:57:46.750 --> 05:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
to bother me um we asked some very basic
 
05:57:50.030 --> 05:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
qu or I did or um some very basic
 
05:57:52.270 --> 05:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
questions about well how do you teach
 
05:57:55.110 --> 05:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
these people and there you know the
 
05:57:57.310 --> 05:57:57.320 align:start position:0%
first question that I asked them how do
 
05:57:59.788 --> 05:57:59.798 align:start position:0%
you teach and let let me take a step
 
05:58:02.190 --> 05:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
back Optometry from what I understand is
 
05:58:04.350 --> 05:58:04.360 align:start position:0%
a four-year degree me going to medical
 
05:58:06.990 --> 05:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
school that's a four-year degree my
 
05:58:08.468 --> 05:58:08.478 align:start position:0%
understanding was the training they got
 
05:58:10.310 --> 05:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
in doing these procedures was a three to
 
05:58:13.070 --> 05:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
four- week elective in their senior year
 
05:58:15.750 --> 05:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
um and that so I wanted to know exactly
 
05:58:18.430 --> 05:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
what happens in that time frame the
 
05:58:20.350 --> 05:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
first question I asked how do you teach
 
05:58:23.110 --> 05:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
the answer was see one do one teach one
 
05:58:25.830 --> 05:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
does anybody here know what that means
 
05:58:28.190 --> 05:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
it means that you see one you do one and
 
05:58:30.190 --> 05:58:30.200 align:start position:0%
you teach one and I will guarantee you
 
05:58:32.750 --> 05:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
that is not how you learn surgery that
 
05:58:34.910 --> 05:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
is probably the worst way to learn how
 
05:58:37.548 --> 05:58:37.558 align:start position:0%
to teach surgery so the next question I
 
05:58:39.788 --> 05:58:39.798 align:start position:0%
asked well how many procedures does each
 
05:58:43.150 --> 05:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
student get to do as a um primary
 
05:58:45.910 --> 05:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
surgeon and uh the one both of them
 
05:58:48.510 --> 05:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
answered the question I don't know and I
 
05:58:50.548 --> 05:58:50.558 align:start position:0%
looked at him I says you don't know and
 
05:58:52.670 --> 05:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
I said oh okay and then so we're not
 
05:58:54.270 --> 05:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to be mean so I wasn't mean so
 
05:58:56.390 --> 05:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
the third question that I asked was well
 
05:58:59.230 --> 05:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
what's your outcome data and the answer
 
05:59:02.150 --> 05:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
was oh our patients do great and I said
 
05:59:04.510 --> 05:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
what does that mean you know and there
 
05:59:06.230 --> 05:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
was no answer as far as we knew there
 
05:59:08.030 --> 05:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
was no outcome data collected so we
 
05:59:09.830 --> 05:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
followed up on that and we asked some
 
05:59:11.868 --> 05:59:11.878 align:start position:0%
other people they go so where's your
 
05:59:14.070 --> 05:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
outcome data then they said well the
 
05:59:15.788 --> 05:59:15.798 align:start position:0%
outcome data is pretty much would you
 
05:59:17.310 --> 05:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
expect from somebody that had limited
 
05:59:20.510 --> 05:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
training too often we see inappropriate
 
05:59:25.990 --> 05:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosis inappropriate procedure um
 
05:59:29.468 --> 05:59:29.478 align:start position:0%
um in inadequately done so that needs to
 
05:59:31.788 --> 05:59:31.798 align:start position:0%
be repeated so all obviously there's a
 
05:59:35.030 --> 05:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
cost there so it seemed to me that this
 
05:59:37.230 --> 05:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
is I'll be honest I I don't have a
 
05:59:38.910 --> 05:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
problem with scope creep which this
 
05:59:41.830 --> 05:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
functionally is um podiatrists have done
 
05:59:43.868 --> 05:59:43.878 align:start position:0%
it you know how Podiatry did it so they
 
05:59:46.110 --> 05:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
were a non-surgical specialty they added
 
05:59:48.548 --> 05:59:48.558 align:start position:0%
a 4 to sixe Residency program to learn
 
05:59:51.350 --> 05:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
how to do surgery of the foot veterinary
 
05:59:53.590 --> 05:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
medicine they did the exact same thing
 
05:59:55.190 --> 05:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
if you want to be a Veterinary surgeon
 
05:59:57.390 --> 05:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
it's four to six years beyond your your
 
05:59:59.670 --> 05:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
medical school training Dentistry does
 
06:00:02.310 --> 06:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
the exact same thing Physical Therapy
 
06:00:04.628 --> 06:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
when they decided that they wanted to
 
06:00:06.510 --> 06:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
scope creep get more into dependence and
 
06:00:08.110 --> 06:00:08.120 align:start position:0%
what do they do now they require a
 
06:00:10.948 --> 06:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
doctorate level to become a PT that to
 
06:00:12.750 --> 06:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
me seems the right way to do this so
 
06:00:14.468 --> 06:00:14.478 align:start position:0%
when I've asked around well what do you
 
06:00:16.708 --> 06:00:16.718 align:start position:0%
think an optometrist would need to be
 
06:00:20.430 --> 06:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
able to do these three procedures and
 
06:00:22.788 --> 06:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
the answer was a minimum of a one to
 
06:00:26.110 --> 06:00:26.120 align:start position:0%
twoe Fellowship probably with op op
 
06:00:28.150 --> 06:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
nobody can say that word opom you guys
 
06:00:29.510 --> 06:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
got to come up with a new name for your
 
06:00:31.708 --> 06:00:31.718 align:start position:0%
specialty Opthalmology we were talking
 
06:00:34.548 --> 06:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
about that last night um you know you
 
06:00:36.788 --> 06:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
know with Opthalmology oversight because
 
06:00:39.350 --> 06:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
those guys are the experts and then you
 
06:00:41.430 --> 06:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
know you there's a limited number of
 
06:00:43.868 --> 06:00:43.878 align:start position:0%
procedures you can do that may or may
 
06:00:46.190 --> 06:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
not help access the folks from Kentucky
 
06:00:48.310 --> 06:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
told us that these bills did not improve
 
06:00:51.590 --> 06:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
access but um that's what they said um
 
06:00:53.270 --> 06:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
but I think that's the right way to go
 
06:00:55.230 --> 06:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
about doing a scope creep to just come
 
06:00:56.830 --> 06:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
in and say I'm going to do a three-week
 
06:00:58.468 --> 06:00:58.478 align:start position:0%
elective or a four-week elective my
 
06:01:00.190 --> 06:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
senior year and then think that I can go
 
06:01:02.390 --> 06:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
out and do this and you know
 
06:01:04.708 --> 06:01:04.718 align:start position:0%
independently I I have a big problem and
 
06:01:06.830 --> 06:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
the other little minor detail T I did a
 
06:01:09.030 --> 06:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
lot of surgery as a as a before I went
 
06:01:10.788 --> 06:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
to med school I was a world famous
 
06:01:15.948 --> 06:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
rodent surgeon um um I
 
06:01:18.590 --> 06:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
also you know did a lot in med school
 
06:01:20.190 --> 06:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
and then I did a thing with the Indian
 
06:01:22.230 --> 06:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
Health Service in Alaska where I did a
 
06:01:26.030 --> 06:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
lot of surgery um and when I came out of
 
06:01:28.350 --> 06:01:28.360 align:start position:0%
there the first thing I knew was I
 
06:01:30.030 --> 06:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
didn't know enough to be doing this for
 
06:01:32.110 --> 06:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
a living and that I would never do it
 
06:01:35.190 --> 06:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
without as um rep or Dr Murphy now Dr
 
06:01:38.468 --> 06:01:38.478 align:start position:0%
Murphy said without formal training so
 
06:01:41.270 --> 06:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
in some I think there's a pathway
 
06:01:43.948 --> 06:01:43.958 align:start position:0%
forward but this is not it and I think
 
06:01:46.190 --> 06:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
the op optometrist really needed to
 
06:01:47.948 --> 06:01:47.958 align:start position:0%
start thinking about you know let's
 
06:01:50.030 --> 06:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
create a fellowship let's get our people
 
06:01:51.868 --> 06:01:51.878 align:start position:0%
adequately trained and then then they
 
06:01:54.468 --> 06:01:54.478 align:start position:0%
can legitimately start solving the
 
06:01:56.230 --> 06:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
problem of
 
06:01:59.110 --> 06:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
access thank you are there
 
06:02:01.110 --> 06:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing
 
06:02:04.110 --> 06:02:04.120 align:start position:0%
none representative Schmid are thank you
 
06:02:07.070 --> 06:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair so are you aware of what Dr
 
06:02:09.670 --> 06:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
Peters talked to us about this afternoon
 
06:02:11.990 --> 06:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
that they've got a working arrangement
 
06:02:14.070 --> 06:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
it seems with Andrew
 
06:02:16.948 --> 06:02:16.958 align:start position:0%
Goen uh they think they're maybe six to
 
06:02:19.190 --> 06:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
eight months before they could start up
 
06:02:22.708 --> 06:02:22.718 align:start position:0%
doing their practice up
 
06:02:25.788 --> 06:02:25.798 align:start position:0%
there that they would go up there and so
 
06:02:28.270 --> 06:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
forth uh are you aware of that and do
 
06:02:32.150 --> 06:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
you have a comment on that I think it's
 
06:02:35.350 --> 06:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
wonderful um I would bet 30 as you know
 
06:02:38.468 --> 06:02:38.478 align:start position:0%
also doctor about 30 at least 30% of my
 
06:02:41.510 --> 06:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
patients live in the North Country um I
 
06:02:43.548 --> 06:02:43.558 align:start position:0%
would love to see them up there and I
 
06:02:45.150 --> 06:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
talked to them all the time do you have
 
06:02:47.468 --> 06:02:47.478 align:start position:0%
a problem with lack of access to a
 
06:02:49.190 --> 06:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
specialist like me up there and the
 
06:02:52.150 --> 06:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
answer always is no he says we made a
 
06:02:54.990 --> 06:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
conscious decision to live up here and
 
06:02:56.548 --> 06:02:56.558 align:start position:0%
we understand that there's certain
 
06:02:58.390 --> 06:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
things we're going to have to travel for
 
06:03:00.270 --> 06:03:00.280 align:start position:0%
and they have absolutely no problems
 
06:03:02.910 --> 06:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
coming down to see me and conquered in
 
06:03:04.788 --> 06:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
Ideal World yeah we would have every
 
06:03:06.830 --> 06:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
specialty up there imaginable but I
 
06:03:08.830 --> 06:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
think you know we would focus on primary
 
06:03:10.990 --> 06:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
care and not surgery and Specialty Care
 
06:03:13.390 --> 06:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
things like this if we have to focus on
 
06:03:15.590 --> 06:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
something so to answer your question if
 
06:03:17.468 --> 06:03:17.478 align:start position:0%
they're doing that it's
 
06:03:20.670 --> 06:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you you other questions
 
06:03:22.708 --> 06:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you I just have I have
 
06:03:24.788 --> 06:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
one question did did you use the word
 
06:03:24.798 --> 06:03:26.708 align:start position:0%
one question did did you use the word
rodent

06:03:26.708 --> 06:03:26.718 align:start position:0%
rodent
 
06:03:29.750 --> 06:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes um I did I hear that correctly you
 
06:03:32.270 --> 06:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
did hear that correctly I was an onc I
 
06:03:34.230 --> 06:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
was in oncology research before I went
 
06:03:36.390 --> 06:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
to med school and I oper ated on
 
06:03:39.590 --> 06:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
hundreds of rodents who did very well
 
06:03:41.788 --> 06:03:41.798 align:start position:0%
until I sacrificed
 
06:03:45.990 --> 06:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
them okay it's so good to know that
 
06:03:53.110 --> 06:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:55.468 --> 06:03:55.478 align:start position:0%
please thank you madam chairman and
 
06:03:57.270 --> 06:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you to the members of the
 
06:03:59.030 --> 06:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee and thank you all for your
 
06:04:00.868 --> 06:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
service to our wonderful State of New

opthalmologist here in conquer and I'm
 
06:04:09.868 --> 06:04:09.878 align:start position:0%
here to oppose House Bill
 
06:04:13.430 --> 06:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
349 my opposition to House Bill 349 in
 
06:04:16.910 --> 06:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
no way um discounts the contributions
 
06:04:19.190 --> 06:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
and essential services that optometrists
 
06:04:21.910 --> 06:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
provide we have three optometrist in our
 
06:04:23.990 --> 06:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
practice and we work as a collaborative
 
06:04:27.030 --> 06:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
team I also can attend the subcommittee
 
06:04:29.230 --> 06:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
hearing just to answer the question
 
06:04:32.468 --> 06:04:32.478 align:start position:0%
about the states that have um scope
 
06:04:34.628 --> 06:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
expansion there are actually 10 states

are lobbying the federal government in
 
06:05:20.590 --> 06:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
order to do the lasers so they cannot do
 
06:05:23.670 --> 06:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
lasers at VA facilities now this bill
 
06:05:25.750 --> 06:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
would allow optometrist to perform
 
06:05:28.670 --> 06:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
surgery on the inside of one of the most
 
06:05:31.430 --> 06:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
sensitive complex and important parts of
 
06:05:33.030 --> 06:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
our bodies Our
 
06:05:36.310 --> 06:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
Eyes I'm going wanted to talk to briefly
 
06:05:38.868 --> 06:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
about managing the complications that
 
06:05:41.310 --> 06:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
can arise from these procedures not
 
06:05:43.510 --> 06:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
being able to manage these complications
 
06:05:46.070 --> 06:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
can lead to significant vision loss
 
06:05:47.708 --> 06:05:47.718 align:start position:0%
that's important because if urgent
 
06:05:50.230 --> 06:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
additional surgery is needed as a result
 
06:05:53.310 --> 06:05:53.320 align:start position:0%
of a complication optometrist would not
 
06:05:56.548 --> 06:05:56.558 align:start position:0%
be able to perform those sight saving
 
06:05:59.390 --> 06:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
techniques in contrast opthalmologists
 
06:06:01.868 --> 06:06:01.878 align:start position:0%
or train surgeons who have undergone the
 
06:06:03.990 --> 06:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
training to perform safely and manage
 
06:06:06.070 --> 06:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
any complications that arise
 
06:06:08.390 --> 06:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
here are just a couple of examples laser
 
06:06:10.788 --> 06:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
iridotomy and Laser trabeculoplasty can
 
06:06:12.788 --> 06:06:12.798 align:start position:0%
lead to bleeding in the eye and high
 
06:06:15.548 --> 06:06:15.558 align:start position:0%
pressure If severe enough the fluid may
 
06:06:17.750 --> 06:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
need to be surgically evacuated from the
 
06:06:20.390 --> 06:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
inside of the eye and the inability to
 
06:06:22.628 --> 06:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
manage that complication in real time
 
06:06:24.948 --> 06:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
could lead to vision loss preventable
 
06:06:28.190 --> 06:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
vision loss during laser capsulotomy the
 
06:06:30.948 --> 06:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
laser can put craters um in the lens
 
06:06:33.788 --> 06:06:33.798 align:start position:0%
inside the eye that lens may need to be
 
06:06:36.670 --> 06:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
replaced if during l capsulotomy the
 
06:06:39.590 --> 06:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
laser opens up too much of the capsule
 
06:06:41.628 --> 06:06:41.638 align:start position:0%
the lens could fall back into the back
 
06:06:44.070 --> 06:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
of the eye and then have to go in to
 
06:06:46.390 --> 06:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
have another surgery to pull that lens
 
06:06:49.230 --> 06:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
out and replace it um and there's always
 
06:06:51.430 --> 06:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
a risk of retinal detachment with laser
 
06:06:54.070 --> 06:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
surgery the procedures to treat any of
 
06:06:56.310 --> 06:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
these complications are performed by
 
06:06:59.190 --> 06:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist and any reoperation or
 
06:07:01.708 --> 06:07:01.718 align:start position:0%
revision surgery is far more difficult
 
06:07:04.190 --> 06:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
than the original surgery as I said
 
06:07:05.990 --> 06:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
they're currently 10 states that allow
 
06:07:08.070 --> 06:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
laser surgery to be performed by
 
06:07:10.230 --> 06:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
optometrist in most of the states that
 
06:07:12.628 --> 06:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
allow optometrist to perform surgery
 
06:07:15.070 --> 06:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement to report the
 
06:07:17.150 --> 06:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
negative outcomes of laser surgery to
 
06:07:18.270 --> 06:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
the board of
 
06:07:21.468 --> 06:07:21.478 align:start position:0%
Optometry a study by Nathan louser and
 
06:07:23.510 --> 06:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
or optometrist who wrote the study
 
06:07:25.350 --> 06:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
claims that optometrist can safely
 
06:07:28.310 --> 06:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
perform capsulotomy surgery the medical
 
06:07:30.910 --> 06:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
community has a few concerns with that
 
06:07:33.230 --> 06:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
publication the study May induce
 
06:07:35.110 --> 06:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
selection bias because it does not
 
06:07:37.110 --> 06:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
include P the patients nor the
 
06:07:39.708 --> 06:07:39.718 align:start position:0%
optometrist were randomized and it does
 
06:07:41.468 --> 06:07:41.478 align:start position:0%
not indicate that the participants in
 
06:07:44.270 --> 06:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
this study were those serially eligible
 
06:07:47.150 --> 06:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
to participate in the study second the
 
06:07:49.310 --> 06:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
results of the study are not
 
06:07:51.310 --> 06:07:51.320 align:start position:0%
generalizable because the experience of
 
06:07:53.948 --> 06:07:53.958 align:start position:0%
the Arthurs is likely far more extensive
 
06:07:55.510 --> 06:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
than the optometrist who would be
 
06:07:57.430 --> 06:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
performing those procedures in New
 
06:08:00.230 --> 06:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lastly the study shows no
 
06:08:02.750 --> 06:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
significant adverse effects but as we've
 
06:08:05.270 --> 06:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
heard from Real World experience we know
 
06:08:07.750 --> 06:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
that not representative of laser
 
06:08:10.150 --> 06:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
surgery furthermore there's a study
 
06:08:12.350 --> 06:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
published in a major medical journal
 
06:08:14.270 --> 06:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
that looked at
 
06:08:17.110 --> 06:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
1,384 eyes of patients that underwent a
 
06:08:19.430 --> 06:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
surgical laser procedure used to treat
 
06:08:22.310 --> 06:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
glaucoma in Oklahoma the study found
 
06:08:24.430 --> 06:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
that there was
 
06:08:27.468 --> 06:08:27.478 align:start position:0%
189% increased Hazard of requiring
 
06:08:29.830 --> 06:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
additional laser treatment in the same
 
06:08:32.070 --> 06:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
ey when the surgery was performed by an
 
06:08:34.670 --> 06:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
optometrist compared to the same laser
 
06:08:38.110 --> 06:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
done by Opthomologist let me repeat that
 
06:08:39.830 --> 06:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
I know one representative here likes
 
06:08:43.030 --> 06:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
numbers in percentage a
 
06:08:46.070 --> 06:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
189% increased Hazard and that's not
 
06:08:48.468 --> 06:08:48.478 align:start position:0%
just a statistic that's a warning the
 
06:08:50.110 --> 06:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
study concluded that there could be
 
06:08:52.548 --> 06:08:52.558 align:start position:0%
multiple reasons all of which are highly
 
06:08:54.510 --> 06:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
concerning it could mean that
 
06:08:56.548 --> 06:08:56.558 align:start position:0%
optometrists are not adequately trained
 
06:08:58.990 --> 06:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
in the laser procedure itself it could
 
06:09:01.230 --> 06:09:01.240 align:start position:0%
mean that optometrist do not understand
 
06:09:04.190 --> 06:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
how to perform the gonioscopy which is a
 
06:09:06.628 --> 06:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
tricky test to evaluate if the patient
 
06:09:09.150 --> 06:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
is even a candidate for the surgery or
 
06:09:11.070 --> 06:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
it could mean that optometrists don't
 
06:09:13.190 --> 06:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
understand that you have to wait 6 to 8
 
06:09:15.070 --> 06:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
weeks before you know if the laser
 
06:09:17.830 --> 06:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
worked initially this study illustrates
 
06:09:20.390 --> 06:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
a real concern for patient safety and it
 
06:09:22.390 --> 06:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
shows that it is not coste effective to
 
06:09:24.830 --> 06:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
have optometrist do surgery and to quote
 
06:09:27.230 --> 06:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
the investigators of the study quote
 
06:09:29.708 --> 06:09:29.718 align:start position:0%
Health policy makers should be cautious
 
06:09:31.868 --> 06:09:31.878 align:start position:0%
about approving laser privileges for
 
06:09:34.868 --> 06:09:34.878 align:start position:0%
optometrist practicing in other states
 
06:09:36.430 --> 06:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
it's important important to consider how
 
06:09:38.590 --> 06:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
professional malpractice companies view
 
06:09:41.310 --> 06:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
optometrist performing surgery the
 
06:09:43.910 --> 06:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
Opthalmic Mutual Insurance Company
 
06:09:48.230 --> 06:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
ensures over 6,500 Opthomologist and
 
06:09:52.270 --> 06:09:52.280 align:start position:0%
over 800 optometrist but they will not
 
06:09:54.590 --> 06:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
provide malpractice insurance to
 
06:09:57.990 --> 06:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
optometrist who perform surgery and they
 
06:10:00.190 --> 06:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
say they won't citing a lack of
 
06:10:03.310 --> 06:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
available data on liability and lack of
 
06:10:07.030 --> 06:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
necessary education training and
 
06:10:09.468 --> 06:10:09.478 align:start position:0%
experience in the handful of states that
 
06:10:11.788 --> 06:10:11.798 align:start position:0%
have authorized optometrist to perform
 
06:10:13.750 --> 06:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
surgery there are cases involving
 
06:10:16.708 --> 06:10:16.718 align:start position:0%
surgical complications misdiagnosis and
 
06:10:18.990 --> 06:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
harm patients some of whom have suffered
 
06:10:20.948 --> 06:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
permanent vision loss those who were
 
06:10:23.590 --> 06:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
here last year heard from Vicky rutage
 
06:10:25.910 --> 06:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
and if you um haven't seen her testimony
 
06:10:28.708 --> 06:10:28.718 align:start position:0%
I urge you to go back and view it these
 
06:10:30.510 --> 06:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
procedures are not simple and
 
06:10:32.750 --> 06:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
uncomplicated the patients harm during
 
06:10:34.750 --> 06:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
procedures performed by optometrist in
 
06:10:37.868 --> 06:10:37.878 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma Kentucky and Louisiana would
 
06:10:40.030 --> 06:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
certainly attest to that they are real
 
06:10:43.110 --> 06:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
people who experienced real harm my
 
06:10:46.310 --> 06:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 349 is firmly
 
06:10:48.830 --> 06:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
rooted in patient safety and I hope that
 
06:10:51.310 --> 06:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
you will also oppose this Bill thank you
 
06:10:53.468 --> 06:10:53.478 align:start position:0%
for your time and I'm happy to answer
 
06:10:53.478 --> 06:10:54.230 align:start position:0%
for your time and I'm happy to answer
any

06:10:54.230 --> 06:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:10:57.868 --> 06:10:57.878 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there
 
06:10:59.830 --> 06:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you the advantage of
 
06:11:02.310 --> 06:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
coming late the questions have all
 
06:11:14.830 --> 06:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:17.150 --> 06:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
all right good afternoon everyone uh my
 
06:11:19.110 --> 06:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
name is Grant uh Shai someone of the
 
06:11:20.830 --> 06:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology residents at Dartmouth if
 
06:11:21.990 --> 06:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
you have a specific question about
 
06:11:24.030 --> 06:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology residency I can answer it
 
06:11:26.708 --> 06:11:26.718 align:start position:0%
from firsthand experience um as
 
06:11:28.110 --> 06:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
requested I won't sort of read my
 
06:11:29.868 --> 06:11:29.878 align:start position:0%
remarks which are in sort of our written
 
06:11:31.788 --> 06:11:31.798 align:start position:0%
packet I'll just try to summarize some
 
06:11:34.510 --> 06:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
of the key highlights um one of the big
 
06:11:36.628 --> 06:11:36.638 align:start position:0%
things that and I've learned going
 
06:11:39.150 --> 06:11:39.160 align:start position:0%
through my residency program is it's um
 
06:11:40.270 --> 06:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
one thing that's really important to
 
06:11:42.350 --> 06:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
develop as a surge is not only the depth
 
06:11:43.948 --> 06:11:43.958 align:start position:0%
of training in other words maybe how
 
06:11:45.868 --> 06:11:45.878 align:start position:0%
many procedures you've done but the
 
06:11:47.590 --> 06:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
breadth of training how many types of
 
06:11:51.310 --> 06:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
procedures you've done um when I was uh
 
06:11:53.190 --> 06:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
first learning to do these yag
 
06:11:54.910 --> 06:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
capsulotomies that's one of the lasers
 
06:11:56.628 --> 06:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
that are in this bill I honestly
 
06:11:58.628 --> 06:11:58.638 align:start position:0%
struggled a lot it's hard to see that
 
06:12:00.990 --> 06:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
posterior capsule it's very thin sort of
 
06:12:02.868 --> 06:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
in the two to four Micron sort of
 
06:12:05.990 --> 06:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
thickness if memory serves um I got
 
06:12:09.110 --> 06:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
better at it though when my uh former PD
 
06:12:10.708 --> 06:12:10.718 align:start position:0%
really took me into the operating room
 
06:12:12.910 --> 06:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
to do cataract surgery you see the
 
06:12:14.510 --> 06:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
capsule under a micro surgical
 
06:12:16.510 --> 06:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
microscope you can see exactly what is
 
06:12:19.468 --> 06:12:19.478 align:start position:0%
being targeted in the yag
 
06:12:21.990 --> 06:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
capsulotomy um so you know it's been
 
06:12:24.310 --> 06:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
testified earlier that in Opthalmology
 
06:12:25.868 --> 06:12:25.878 align:start position:0%
residency you do lots of different types
 
06:12:28.230 --> 06:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
of procedures many of which are not
 
06:12:31.110 --> 06:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
related to the laser therapy but what I
 
06:12:33.350 --> 06:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
would um propose is that it's actually a
 
06:12:35.708 --> 06:12:35.718 align:start position:0%
feature of our training not a a bug to
 
06:12:37.310 --> 06:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
do different types of surgery you get
 
06:12:39.350 --> 06:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
better at surgery by doing different
 
06:12:41.350 --> 06:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
types of surgery that's why the training
 
06:12:42.468 --> 06:12:42.478 align:start position:0%
is what it
 
06:12:46.590 --> 06:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
is um and what I feel is the hardest
 
06:12:49.150 --> 06:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
part of being a Opthalmology resident is
 
06:12:51.670 --> 06:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
not actually doing the technical aspects
 
06:12:54.310 --> 06:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
of the procedure but actually knowing
 
06:12:56.830 --> 06:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
the um that you're doing the right
 
06:12:59.990 --> 06:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
procedure for that patient um it's not
 
06:13:01.628 --> 06:13:01.638 align:start position:0%
something you can read in a book and
 
06:13:03.910 --> 06:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
just say these are the clear indications
 
06:13:05.430 --> 06:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
um it's not something you can get by
 
06:13:08.030 --> 06:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
seeing maybe even a few uh patient
 
06:13:11.390 --> 06:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
examples it honestly takes example after
 
06:13:14.910 --> 06:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
example after example for years to know
 
06:13:16.750 --> 06:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
um when patients would benefit from a
 
06:13:20.030 --> 06:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
surgery it's really hard um and I think
 
06:13:21.750 --> 06:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
that is sort of something that I feel
 
06:13:23.910 --> 06:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
very fortunate to get in my Opthalmology
 
06:13:25.670 --> 06:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
residency which is an important sort of
 
06:13:29.868 --> 06:13:29.878 align:start position:0%
component of treating patients well um I
 
06:13:31.868 --> 06:13:31.878 align:start position:0%
think optometrist have already um
 
06:13:33.788 --> 06:13:33.798 align:start position:0%
testified as to their specific sort of
 
06:13:36.390 --> 06:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
training uh for their procedures but
 
06:13:37.750 --> 06:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
what I would feel like as I was going
 
06:13:39.750 --> 06:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
through my residency is If I Only Had
 
06:13:42.510 --> 06:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
specific training and sort of um laser
 
06:13:45.628 --> 06:13:45.638 align:start position:0%
treatments you know in sort of models or
 
06:13:47.868 --> 06:13:47.878 align:start position:0%
even on a few live patients I would not
 
06:13:49.310 --> 06:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable doing even those
 
06:13:50.590 --> 06:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
procedures because I don't feel like I
 
06:13:52.468 --> 06:13:52.478 align:start position:0%
would have the depth or or excuse me the
 
06:13:55.670 --> 06:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
breadth of surgical experience necessary
 
06:13:57.310 --> 06:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
to know when to do those procedures
 
06:14:01.310 --> 06:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
safely and um uh maybe uh not having as
 
06:14:03.350 --> 06:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
best control of my hands that I got from
 
06:14:06.070 --> 06:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
other types of procedures um there's the
 
06:14:07.628 --> 06:14:07.638 align:start position:0%
big big things I wanted to say I would
 
06:14:10.628 --> 06:14:10.638 align:start position:0%
like to say just lastly that you know
 
06:14:12.390 --> 06:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
we're all in the same team and I hope
 
06:14:13.910 --> 06:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
that even though I don't think this is
 
06:14:16.948 --> 06:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
the right Bill policy for to advance New
 
06:14:18.350 --> 06:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I hope that it can sort of
 
06:14:19.868 --> 06:14:19.878 align:start position:0%
stimulate discussion to get us to a
 
06:14:21.788 --> 06:14:21.798 align:start position:0%
better better place so thank you I'm
 
06:14:22.910 --> 06:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions if there
 
06:14:25.110 --> 06:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
are any thank you very much our
 
06:14:25.120 --> 06:14:27.150 align:start position:0%
are any thank you very much our
represent

06:14:27.150 --> 06:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
represent
 
06:14:29.430 --> 06:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
scitec I can see your training as a
 
06:14:32.628 --> 06:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
doctor is proceeding I can't read your
 
06:14:34.830 --> 06:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
writing I worked a long time to write
 
06:14:40.868 --> 06:14:40.878 align:start position:0%
Qui quickly as Ann h e h e i z um last
 
06:14:43.990 --> 06:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
name is that what you're asking so s c u
 
06:14:47.868 --> 06:14:47.878 align:start position:0%
l t h e i
 
06:14:50.350 --> 06:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
s if you can say it three times that'd
 
06:14:52.830 --> 06:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
be even better it's It's Tricky for all
 
06:14:55.708 --> 06:14:55.718 align:start position:0%
of us thank you
 
06:14:58.910 --> 06:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
yeah power thank you for taking my
 
06:15:02.270 --> 06:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
question so I was just wondering how
 
06:15:06.628 --> 06:15:06.638 align:start position:0%
many uh hours of training uh do you as a
 
06:15:09.910 --> 06:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
resident do and will do uh throughout
 
06:15:09.920 --> 06:15:11.270 align:start position:0%
resident do and will do uh throughout
your

06:15:11.270 --> 06:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
your
 
06:15:14.510 --> 06:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
residency thank you for the question um
 
06:15:17.230 --> 06:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
I um have not keeping track on an hour
 
06:15:18.708 --> 06:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
by- hour basis because I think it would
 
06:15:20.468 --> 06:15:20.478 align:start position:0%
make me maybe a little uh remiss for
 
06:15:21.510 --> 06:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
some of the hours that it could have
 
06:15:23.310 --> 06:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
spent in other ways I think a rough
 
06:15:24.990 --> 06:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
estimate is about
 
06:15:27.788 --> 06:15:27.798 align:start position:0%
177,000 but um to give you a rough
 
06:15:30.030 --> 06:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
perspective it changes year to year as a
 
06:15:32.670 --> 06:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
resident in intern year I was logging
 
06:15:36.310 --> 06:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
routinely around the 55 to 65 hours uh
 
06:15:39.390 --> 06:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
Mark each week for that year when I was
 
06:15:42.110 --> 06:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
doing a pgy2 year I was doing a little
 
06:15:43.390 --> 06:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
bit less
 
06:15:47.590 --> 06:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
maybe um average ballpark 55 hours a lot
 
06:15:49.390 --> 06:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
of that was one week on call than one
 
06:15:51.868 --> 06:15:51.878 align:start position:0%
week off call so you know I saw I've
 
06:15:53.548 --> 06:15:53.558 align:start position:0%
seen patients with acute angle closure
 
06:15:54.948 --> 06:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
which was one of the things that was
 
06:15:56.750 --> 06:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier that needs an urgent
 
06:15:59.910 --> 06:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
LPI I've seen exactly four I've tried
 
06:16:02.070 --> 06:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
two lpis overnight I've gotten exactly
 
06:16:03.948 --> 06:16:03.958 align:start position:0%
one to work and that's when I've had
 
06:16:05.990 --> 06:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
I've done a few PR procedures by by that
 
06:16:07.670 --> 06:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
point they're they're they're
 
06:16:11.270 --> 06:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
tricky thank you other
 
06:16:14.468 --> 06:16:14.478 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
06:16:27.468 --> 06:16:27.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:29.868 --> 06:16:29.878 align:start position:0%
Stratton good afternoon um thank you for
 
06:16:32.510 --> 06:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony today um I had a
 
06:16:35.270 --> 06:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
longer statement but in the interest of
 
06:16:37.548 --> 06:16:37.558 align:start position:0%
time I'm not going to repeat what others
 
06:16:39.910 --> 06:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
have said but instead Spotlight their
 
06:16:42.230 --> 06:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
testimony uh my name is Kathy Stratton
 
06:16:44.150 --> 06:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
I'm the CEO of the New Hampshire Medical
 
06:16:46.708 --> 06:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
Society and the medical society strongly
 
06:16:49.350 --> 06:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
opposes House Bill 349 relative to the
 
06:16:52.190 --> 06:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
practice of Optometry and authorization
 
06:16:55.030 --> 06:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
to perform Opthalmic laser
 
06:16:57.070 --> 06:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
procedures the medical society and
 
06:16:59.390 --> 06:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
Physicians of New Hampshire value the
 
06:17:01.548 --> 06:17:01.558 align:start position:0%
contributions of the entire clinical
 
06:17:03.990 --> 06:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
team we're here not to detract from the
 
06:17:06.310 --> 06:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
skill and contri Fusion of
 
06:17:08.750 --> 06:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
optometrist but to ask you to uphold the
 
06:17:14.350 --> 06:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:17.150 --> 06:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
care the issues I want to Spotlight that
 
06:17:19.948 --> 06:17:19.958 align:start position:0%
others have presented today is that um
 
06:17:22.830 --> 06:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
these are serious medical surgeries that
 
06:17:26.548 --> 06:17:26.558 align:start position:0%
house bill 49 will not expand access
 
06:17:29.468 --> 06:17:29.478 align:start position:0%
that training and education matters uh
 
06:17:31.670 --> 06:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
though current educational programs for
 
06:17:34.070 --> 06:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
optometrists include training for this
 
06:17:37.270 --> 06:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
procedure many practicing optometrists
 
06:17:38.910 --> 06:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire will not have that
 
06:17:40.030 --> 06:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
level of
 
06:17:42.270 --> 06:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
training um IE surgeons and
 
06:17:44.270 --> 06:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
opthamologists are broadly trained and
 
06:17:47.190 --> 06:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
uniquely qualified to identify and
 
06:17:50.230 --> 06:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
respond to medical issues and address
 
06:17:53.910 --> 06:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
any unexpected or adverse outcomes New
 
06:17:56.548 --> 06:17:56.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's eye surgeons are actively
 
06:17:59.350 --> 06:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
working on a plan to expand access in
 
06:18:00.628 --> 06:18:00.638 align:start position:0%
the north
 
06:18:03.030 --> 06:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
regions and I want to finish up by
 
06:18:04.788 --> 06:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
saying that the human body is Cal
 
06:18:06.948 --> 06:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
complex and the medical society urges
 
06:18:08.990 --> 06:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
you to consider the benefit of this
 
06:18:11.510 --> 06:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
broad medical education and clinical
 
06:18:13.350 --> 06:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
training of
 
06:18:15.430 --> 06:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
opthamologists it's likely the most
 
06:18:18.270 --> 06:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
asked question when patients that qu
 
06:18:20.468 --> 06:18:20.478 align:start position:0%
patients have When selecting a clinical
 
06:18:23.230 --> 06:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
provider our state's eye physicians are
 
06:18:25.468 --> 06:18:25.478 align:start position:0%
uniquely qualified to provide
 
06:18:28.110 --> 06:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
highlevel health care and for these
 
06:18:29.590 --> 06:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
reasons the New Hampshire Medical
 
06:18:31.270 --> 06:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
Society encourages the committee to
 
06:18:37.910 --> 06:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:42.590 --> 06:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
passl thank you itl her language was
 
06:18:45.868 --> 06:18:45.878 align:start position:0%
perfectly understandable are there any
 
06:18:48.510 --> 06:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative SCH thank
 
06:18:51.468 --> 06:18:51.478 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I was only correcting
 
06:18:53.468 --> 06:18:53.478 align:start position:0%
her in terms of her terminology I
 
06:18:56.910 --> 06:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
understood what she was saying anyway so
 
06:18:59.590 --> 06:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
the thing is the the Medical Society has
 
06:19:02.110 --> 06:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
taken a clear position here we've heard
 
06:19:06.510 --> 06:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
from Dr Peters and a couple of others
 
06:19:09.430 --> 06:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
to with regard to the proposed facility
 
06:19:11.350 --> 06:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
at Anders
 
06:19:15.070 --> 06:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
gaget can you make a commitment today to
 
06:19:18.628 --> 06:19:18.638 align:start position:0%
us that the medical society will stand
 
06:19:22.468 --> 06:19:22.478 align:start position:0%
behind these efforts to
 
06:19:22.478 --> 06:19:24.468 align:start position:0%
behind these efforts to
expedite

06:19:24.468 --> 06:19:24.478 align:start position:0%
expedite
 
06:19:27.830 --> 06:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
those uh the the the ability to perform
 
06:19:30.468 --> 06:19:30.478 align:start position:0%
those procedures for the residents of
 
06:19:34.990 --> 06:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
the North country as quickly as possible
 
06:19:35.000 --> 06:19:36.350 align:start position:0%
the North country as quickly as possible
well

06:19:36.350 --> 06:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:19:40.628 --> 06:19:40.638 align:start position:0%
um I will qualify my response um that
 
06:19:42.708 --> 06:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
you know this is an independent Endeavor
 
06:19:46.948 --> 06:19:46.958 align:start position:0%
we are working with the um I the Society
 
06:19:48.310 --> 06:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
of I
 
06:19:52.548 --> 06:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
surgeons and to to move this along as
 
06:19:54.868 --> 06:19:54.878 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible I mean we're we're
 
06:19:56.788 --> 06:19:56.798 align:start position:0%
not in the driver's seat here but we are
 
06:19:59.030 --> 06:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
supporting that endeavor and we do see
 
06:20:03.030 --> 06:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
this as a model um for other uh you know
 
06:20:05.150 --> 06:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
in for for other
 
06:20:08.350 --> 06:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
Specialties that may need to expand care
 
06:20:10.868 --> 06:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
in that way I'll bring this contract
 
06:20:13.868 --> 06:20:13.878 align:start position:0%
over afterwards for your thank you very
 
06:20:15.070 --> 06:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
and let me just say I've been with the
 
06:20:17.990 --> 06:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
medical society five months so um I'm
 
06:20:19.510 --> 06:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
happy to be here in New Hampshire and
 
06:20:21.468 --> 06:20:21.478 align:start position:0%
working with Physicians toward uh
 
06:20:24.548 --> 06:20:24.558 align:start position:0%
quality Care here representative scitec
 
06:20:27.548 --> 06:20:27.558 align:start position:0%
has a question uh the chair uh
 
06:20:31.670 --> 06:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:36.910 --> 06:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:39.190 --> 06:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
word of the day other
 
06:20:41.350 --> 06:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
06:20:42.910 --> 06:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
all for your
 
06:20:54.628 --> 06:20:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:57.670 --> 06:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
mandoo thank you madam chairin to let me
 
06:20:59.750 --> 06:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
speak today and members of the committee
 
06:21:02.030 --> 06:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
my name is Katherine morando I'm an
 
06:21:04.070 --> 06:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist physician and surgeon
 
06:21:06.230 --> 06:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
here at ey Center in town and I'm also a
 
06:21:06.240 --> 06:21:07.468 align:start position:0%
here at ey Center in town and I'm also a
glaucoma

06:21:07.468 --> 06:21:07.478 align:start position:0%
glaucoma
 
06:21:09.788 --> 06:21:09.798 align:start position:0%
specialist I apologize I'm a little sick
 
06:21:11.708 --> 06:21:11.718 align:start position:0%
today but I'm here today in strong
 
06:21:14.468 --> 06:21:14.478 align:start position:0%
opposition to house spill 349 out of
 
06:21:16.788 --> 06:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
concern for the safety of my patients I
 
06:21:18.230 --> 06:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
think the testimonies so far have been
 
06:21:19.548 --> 06:21:19.558 align:start position:0%
pretty good I know you've been here a
 
06:21:22.310 --> 06:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
long time so I don't mean to reiterate
 
06:21:24.830 --> 06:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
what's already been said my plan was to
 
06:21:28.590 --> 06:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
talk about laser safety and um and the
 
06:21:30.750 --> 06:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
exact details of the laser surgeries
 
06:21:32.670 --> 06:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
being discussed in this bill and I have
 
06:21:35.150 --> 06:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
some diagrams but um
 
06:21:37.270 --> 06:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
if you feel you understand the lasers
 
06:21:38.708 --> 06:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
being discussed in this bill I also
 
06:21:42.788 --> 06:21:42.798 align:start position:0%
don't want to bore you to tears so um I
 
06:21:45.070 --> 06:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
may just see if there's a general
 
06:21:46.390 --> 06:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
consensus it doesn't look like there's
 
06:21:49.430 --> 06:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
vast enthusiasm for more details than no
 
06:21:50.670 --> 06:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
okay so if you feel you understand the
 
06:21:52.708 --> 06:21:52.718 align:start position:0%
lasers there is a lot of detail in the
 
06:21:54.868 --> 06:21:54.878 align:start position:0%
handout that was uh the packet that
 
06:21:56.590 --> 06:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
large packet we gave and I have these
 
06:21:58.750 --> 06:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
diagrams as well I'll stick around if
 
06:22:01.030 --> 06:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
anyone has a burning interest in
 
06:22:03.788 --> 06:22:03.798 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology or Opthalmic surgery and
 
06:22:05.190 --> 06:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
wants to see the details but I don't
 
06:22:08.150 --> 06:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
want to put you to sleep um either if
 
06:22:11.350 --> 06:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
there are specific questions too I would
 
06:22:12.910 --> 06:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
that are still burning I'd be happy to
 
06:22:16.230 --> 06:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
just directly answer those um before
 
06:22:18.430 --> 06:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
hitting the
 
06:22:20.310 --> 06:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
highlights I think the highlights would
 
06:22:23.270 --> 06:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
be the best okay so the highlights um
 
06:22:25.150 --> 06:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
you know I think in just in general I
 
06:22:26.868 --> 06:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
think there's a misguided comfort in
 
06:22:28.708 --> 06:22:28.718 align:start position:0%
laser surgery thinking you just kind of
 
06:22:30.270 --> 06:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
go into a room the doctor pushes a
 
06:22:31.990 --> 06:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
button and that's that's all that
 
06:22:34.708 --> 06:22:34.718 align:start position:0%
happens but it's a surgery a laser is a
 
06:22:36.510 --> 06:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
tool used by a surgeon just like a
 
06:22:39.190 --> 06:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
scalpel it burns it melts it coagulates
 
06:22:41.110 --> 06:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
and Alters tissues and there are serious
 
06:22:45.150 --> 06:22:45.160 align:start position:0%
blinding risks involved
 
06:22:50.990 --> 06:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
um as far as the laser iridotomy goes um
 
06:22:52.270 --> 06:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't want to bore you with
 
06:22:53.628 --> 06:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
all that you said you think you know it
 
06:22:55.510 --> 06:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
so I'll stick I guess with my part of it
 
06:22:57.788 --> 06:22:57.798 align:start position:0%
as a glaucoma specialist after
 
06:22:59.788 --> 06:22:59.798 align:start position:0%
completing four years of a surgical
 
06:23:02.150 --> 06:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
training in Opthalmology I did an
 
06:23:04.910 --> 06:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
additional year of glaucoma training in
 
06:23:07.948 --> 06:23:07.958 align:start position:0%
glaucoma surgery and lasers and I get a
 
06:23:09.948 --> 06:23:09.958 align:start position:0%
lot of even internal referrals from
 
06:23:12.750 --> 06:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
other opthalmologists for these lasers
 
06:23:15.150 --> 06:23:15.160 align:start position:0%
and these are other surgeons who
 
06:23:17.230 --> 06:23:17.240 align:start position:0%
technically can do these surgeries but
 
06:23:19.750 --> 06:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
they send them to me because the Nuance
 
06:23:22.430 --> 06:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
of deciding who needs surgery can be
 
06:23:25.230 --> 06:23:25.240 align:start position:0%
complicated um and some of these lasers
 
06:23:30.070 --> 06:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
can be challenging especially these most
 
06:23:32.868 --> 06:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
99.9% of the time these are not an
 
06:23:35.708 --> 06:23:35.718 align:start position:0%
emergency the very rare time that the
 
06:23:39.548 --> 06:23:39.558 align:start position:0%
iridotomy laser is an emergency is
 
06:23:41.708 --> 06:23:41.718 align:start position:0%
really difficult when you're dealing
 
06:23:43.830 --> 06:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
with these patients vomiting in front of
 
06:23:47.350 --> 06:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
you their cornea is cloudy um you can't
 
06:23:49.390 --> 06:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
even do the laser most of the time
 
06:23:51.590 --> 06:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
because you can't see the tissue it's
 
06:23:53.430 --> 06:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
too swollen you're giving them
 
06:23:55.750 --> 06:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
medications and treating them and
 
06:23:57.190 --> 06:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes you just need to take them
 
06:24:00.510 --> 06:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
right to the operating room so um I
 
06:24:02.868 --> 06:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
think most of the time these are
 
06:24:05.230 --> 06:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
elective lasers and sometimes they can
 
06:24:06.468 --> 06:24:06.478 align:start position:0%
get pretty
 
06:24:09.548 --> 06:24:09.558 align:start position:0%
complicated um I did have one of my
 
06:24:12.468 --> 06:24:12.478 align:start position:0%
mentors in in training taught me very
 
06:24:15.070 --> 06:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
early on that knowing who to operate on
 
06:24:18.030 --> 06:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
and when is just as important as knowing
 
06:24:20.948 --> 06:24:20.958 align:start position:0%
how to perform the surgery and that is
 
06:24:23.430 --> 06:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
really what's honed over five years of
 
06:24:26.750 --> 06:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
surgical residency and fellowship under
 
06:24:29.628 --> 06:24:29.638 align:start position:0%
the guidance of experienced surgeons and
 
06:24:31.310 --> 06:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
these decisions don't just involve
 
06:24:34.430 --> 06:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
knowing this these three surgeries but
 
06:24:36.628 --> 06:24:36.638 align:start position:0%
also the scope of all other surgeries
 
06:24:39.310 --> 06:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
that you do and and sometimes one is a
 
06:24:41.510 --> 06:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
better option than the other I think
 
06:24:44.468 --> 06:24:44.478 align:start position:0%
I've seen a lot of um incorrect
 
06:24:48.310 --> 06:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
referrals as well that um do concern me
 
06:24:51.110 --> 06:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
for consider I'm sending this patient
 
06:24:54.270 --> 06:24:54.280 align:start position:0%
over to consider doing an SLT laser I've
 
06:24:56.230 --> 06:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
recently had a patient sent to me with a
 
06:24:59.590 --> 06:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
pressure of 40 that's very high and she
 
06:25:02.670 --> 06:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
was taking every drop already um that we
 
06:25:05.030 --> 06:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
have and there were refr was for that
 
06:25:08.150 --> 06:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
glaucoma laser that would have been a
 
06:25:11.948 --> 06:25:11.958 align:start position:0%
blinding decision for her because that
 
06:25:14.430 --> 06:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
laser takes six weeks to work it would
 
06:25:16.110 --> 06:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
not have worked well enough and that is
 
06:25:18.430 --> 06:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
an early intervention I was really
 
06:25:19.990 --> 06:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
grateful the patient came to me we got
 
06:25:21.750 --> 06:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
her right into the operating room and I
 
06:25:23.350 --> 06:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
just saw her for a year followup and
 
06:25:25.628 --> 06:25:25.638 align:start position:0%
she's doing great but it just it wasn't
 
06:25:28.270 --> 06:25:28.280 align:start position:0%
the right option for that patient so I
 
06:25:30.110 --> 06:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
worry that if the referring provider had
 
06:25:31.510 --> 06:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
done that then we would have just
 
06:25:34.390 --> 06:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
delayed her access to care I would also
 
06:25:36.430 --> 06:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
say that um I get a like hundreds per
 
06:25:39.548 --> 06:25:39.558 align:start position:0%
year of referrals for that iridotomy of
 
06:25:42.230 --> 06:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
those referrals I probably perform about
 
06:25:44.670 --> 06:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
50% um that's because there's new
 
06:25:46.910 --> 06:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
literature suggesting most of them can
 
06:25:49.390 --> 06:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
be safely monitored or they're better
 
06:25:52.310 --> 06:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
suited with earlier cataract surgery
 
06:25:54.948 --> 06:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
instead um so I think it's a good thing
 
06:25:57.468 --> 06:25:57.478 align:start position:0%
when we can not overperform procedures
 
06:25:58.830 --> 06:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
it's good for the medical system and
 
06:26:00.510 --> 06:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
good for patients to prevent them from
 
06:26:03.510 --> 06:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
getting complications but um I worry
 
06:26:05.230 --> 06:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
that if we expand Ed scope of some of
 
06:26:07.310 --> 06:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
these procedures the overall rate of
 
06:26:09.350 --> 06:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
procedures might increase and therefore
 
06:26:11.750 --> 06:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
the rate of complications would
 
06:26:14.230 --> 06:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
increase um again I'm happy to go over
 
06:26:15.788 --> 06:26:15.798 align:start position:0%
the lasers later I think those are
 
06:26:18.708 --> 06:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
really the highlights and like everyone
 
06:26:20.990 --> 06:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
else has said I have lots of friends who
 
06:26:22.910 --> 06:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
are optometrists I spoke to them before
 
06:26:25.110 --> 06:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
coming here today to make sure that I
 
06:26:26.830 --> 06:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't misunderstanding what we were
 
06:26:30.150 --> 06:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
saying and they reiterated to me no I I
 
06:26:32.750 --> 06:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
never did a laser ever in training
 
06:26:34.510 --> 06:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
recent friends who graduated from
 
06:26:36.510 --> 06:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts some of them are in states
 
06:26:38.310 --> 06:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
where they legally can practice and they
 
06:26:39.830 --> 06:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
said they get these emails saying sign
 
06:26:42.190 --> 06:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
up for this weekend course to do a laser
 
06:26:44.868 --> 06:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
and um they're sort of shocked by it as
 
06:26:48.030 --> 06:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
are we so I hope we can keep working
 
06:26:50.230 --> 06:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
together like we do every day to the
 
06:26:52.788 --> 06:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
highest um abilities in our our
 
06:26:54.590 --> 06:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
