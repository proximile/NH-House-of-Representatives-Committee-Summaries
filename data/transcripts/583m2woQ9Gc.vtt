00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman

Alicia lekkas Hillsboro 38 Hudson and
 
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.389 align:start position:0%
Alicia lekkas Hillsboro 38 Hudson and
Litchfield

00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
Litchfield
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
and I want to start out by saying when
 
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:23.700 align:start position:0%
we first designed the efas we designed
 
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
them without a cap
 
00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:27.899 align:start position:0%
the intent was that they were open to
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
every kid in the state
 
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.430 align:start position:0%
every kid in the state
because

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
they're all our kids
 
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
and we need to make sure they all have
 
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for an adequate
 
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.750 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for an adequate
education

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
all of their parents pay taxes
 
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
we do not have means testing for public
 
00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:47.459 align:start position:0%
schools why should we have means testing
 
00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:50.579 align:start position:0%
for this this is the opportune this is
 
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
the money for the opportunity for an
 
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
it is per student
 
00:11:59.930 --> 00:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
it should follow each student wherever
 
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:02.220 align:start position:0%
they go
 
00:12:05.569 --> 00:12:05.579 align:start position:0%
it's not the whole shebang it's not
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
everything it costs to send a kid to
 
00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:11.459 align:start position:0%
school it is just the state money
 
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
to give the opportunity for an adequate
 
00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:17.220 align:start position:0%
education for every child in the state
 
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
and so therefore this was designed so
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
that every child can get it and that's
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
what this bill does it just gets rid of
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
the cap that got added later
 
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
and puts it back to the way it was
 
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.569 align:start position:0%
and puts it back to the way it was
originally

00:12:32.569 --> 00:12:32.579 align:start position:0%
originally
 
00:12:32.579 --> 00:12:35.569 align:start position:0%
originally
um

00:12:35.569 --> 00:12:35.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
and I think that's basically the meat of
 
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
what I have to say but I will be happy
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
to take questions thank you very much
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative are there any questions
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
representative miler
 
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
I guess I have a different uh
 
00:12:56.449 --> 00:12:56.459 align:start position:0%
perspective on the origin of the EFA
 
00:12:56.459 --> 00:12:57.650 align:start position:0%
perspective on the origin of the EFA
accounts

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
that when the commissioner proposed this
 
00:13:05.329 --> 00:13:05.339 align:start position:0%
to the finance committee
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
that he basically focused on the issue
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
of providing an opportunity for those
 
00:13:12.769 --> 00:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
parents who are within the poverty
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
threshold of 300 percent of poverty
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
that would allow them an opportunity to
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
seek additional funding so that their
 
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
children could go to a private or a
 
00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
religious school
 
00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:26.339 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding
 
00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
when the commissioner presented it
 
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:32.220 align:start position:0%
this proposal
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
is contrary then wouldn't you agree that
 
00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
this proposal is contrary to the initial
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
proposal of trying to help impoverished
 
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
families to have additional money to go
 
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
to private and religious schools well
 
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
clearly it's it's opposing what your
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
original understanding was but there
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
were a lot of us worked on this bill for
 
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
months I do not know what the
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner said before Finance but I I
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
because I was not there but I was there
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
when this bill was being worked on
 
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
tweaked discussed I attended trainings
 
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
on it beforehand this bill was around a
 
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:14.220 align:start position:0%
long time before the commissioner
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
presented anything to finance and in its
 
00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
original form and the form as it first
 
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
came to the house there was no cap
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Belcher
 
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
um given the Supreme Court decision that
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
requires New Hampshire to provide an
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
adequate education to all students
 
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
would you believe that we are in line
 
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
with that decision if we are withholding
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
These funds based on any criteria to any
 
00:14:52.009 --> 00:14:52.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
can you see that last part again we are
 
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
in line or out do you think we we are
 
00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
currently following the sentiment of
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
that decision by prohibiting certain
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
students from participating in this
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
program personally I don't think so and
 
00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:08.339 align:start position:0%
I talked with one of the representatives
 
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
who was uh who was around at the time
 
00:15:14.689 --> 00:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
who was who had come up with the
 
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
original adequacy
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
and he said it was intended for every
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
student thank you
 
00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:22.019 align:start position:0%

woodcock
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you chairman well oh
 
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
good to see her again let's wait till
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
that way um there's a couple quick ones
 
00:15:30.839 --> 00:15:32.449 align:start position:0%
that way um there's a couple quick ones
uh

00:15:32.449 --> 00:15:32.459 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
when the EFA program uh initially
 
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
arrived here where did it come from and
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
was that something you thought up where
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
did that program come from that program
 
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.430 align:start position:0%
did that program come from that program
came

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
came
 
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
from quite a few different reps there
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
were a lot who worked together I mean
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
did it come from New Hampshire or
 
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
someone that created somewhere else we
 
00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
brought it in oh no this isn't program
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
this is entirely New Hampshire we did a
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
lot of studying of what had happened in
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
other states through the years of
 
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
various things and we learned a lot and
 
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
we said well we're not going to do that
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to do that and oh
 
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
this seems to be effective in work and
 
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do that and
 
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
um but this was New Hampshire and
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
everybody was looking at us and our EFA
 
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
program because it was different than
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
what other states had done because we
 
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:25.740 align:start position:0%
had learned a lot and fixed a lot
 
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
on it you looked at may I follow up
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you yes please so you look at the
 
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
other ones and then sort of called out
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's the way to put it
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
in there are others like rep cordelli
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
might give you a little more history but
 
00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.350 align:start position:0%
might give you a little more history but
that's

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
um because he I believe he was one of
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
the original sponsors but I was there
 
00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:52.019 align:start position:0%
were a whole lot of us who were giving
 
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
input before it actually came out in its
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
final form just one more information
 
00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
keep it quick
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at the financial note and
 
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
it says indeterminable
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
um when the program started a few years
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
ago it was 129 000 and then it's gone
 
00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
through multi Millions already
 
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
um so what would that look like in your
 
00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:17.459 align:start position:0%
mind uh if it's for only in year three
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
and it's already twenty thirty thousand
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
million what so that says to me is that
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
there's a serious need for this and it's
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
very popular and so I think allowing it
 
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
to expand to fill the need because there
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
is a need not everybody can get an
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
adequate education at their local public
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
school not to say that their local
 
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
public school is bad it's just that
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
they're designed for one size fits all
 
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
and it just turns out to be one size
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
fits many and so there are kids for whom
 
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work so we give them an
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to find what does work for
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
them oh you don't have a price tag the
 
00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
answer I don't there's no way to predict
 
00:17:59.930 --> 00:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
that that's right and determine the
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative Allison oh thank you Mr
 
00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:18:06.409 --> 00:18:06.419 align:start position:0%
very quickly does the Department of
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
Education support this Bill yes
 
00:18:12.169 --> 00:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
00:18:12.179 --> 00:18:13.250 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
committee

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher thank you Mr chair I
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify because we've
 
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
heard some talk about the cost of this
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
can you give a rough estimate of what
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
we're providing per student for an EFA
 
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
program versus the average cost to
 
00:18:27.409 --> 00:18:27.419 align:start position:0%
educate a child in New Hampshire Public
 
00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:29.900 align:start position:0%
School well the average
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
EFA currently is about 4 700 and the
 
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
average total cost is about 20 000 19 to
 
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
20 000. so it actually ends up much
 
00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:44.780 align:start position:0%
cheaper to educate a student this way
 
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
but as you take the cap off that average
 
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
is going to go down because since we
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
have the 300 percent
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
Mo that means those kids are all qualify
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
for the free and reduced lunch
 
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
or a good portion of them do at any rate
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced lunch kick in so
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
that raises it to 4 700 but if you have
 
00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:12.539 align:start position:0%
kids above that level they're not going
 
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
to be at that they're going to be closer
 
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
to the 37 or 38 or whatever 100 but at
 
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
any rate it's it's a whole lot cheaper
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
than than what we're currently spending
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
for the questions from the committee
 
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.310 align:start position:0%
for the questions from the committee
representative

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair so um
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
I think in in New Hampshire and these
 
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
numbers might be off a little bit but
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
there's about 15
 
00:19:37.559 --> 00:19:38.470 align:start position:0%
there's about 15
000

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students that attend
 
00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:42.539 align:start position:0%
private schools and about another four
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
or five thousand New Hampshire students
 
00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:46.039 align:start position:0%
that do home school
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
without a income cap and without annual
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
well without any without an income
 
00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:55.970 align:start position:0%
well without any without an income
um

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
cap on this any thoughts as to what the
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
yearly cost would be if if all these
 
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.890 align:start position:0%
yearly cost would be if if all these
students

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:02.900 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:06.299 align:start position:0%
take the voucher of
 
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
to you know help pay their tuition bills
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
but first off it's not a voucher a
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
voucher is a thing that is used then
 
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
I'll then I'll they'll just say um take
 
00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
an EFA
 
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know how many I know that a lot
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
of the home schools will not
 
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
because they don't want any entanglement
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
with the government fair enough what
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
about for the 15 000 follow-up uh what
 
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
what about for the 15 000 students that
 
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
are in private schools
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know well I mean
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
that's the question I mean you can do
 
00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
you can do the math if you're going to
 
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
assume that they all but I can't say
 
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
that they're all going to take it all
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
right so you can make whatever
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
assumptions you want would you believe
 
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
then that if all those students took it
 
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
you'd be talking north of 120 million
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
dollars a year if they all took it if
 
00:20:57.169 --> 00:20:57.179 align:start position:0%
you did the math I believe your math
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay thanks for the questions from the
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing thank you very much
 
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
uh due to the number of cards I'm going
 
00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:06.299 align:start position:0%
to do what we normally do we allow the
 
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
to sponsor the bill to have more time to
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
present uh but we're going to put a
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
limit of three minutes on each uh
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
speaker from this point forward
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to recognize honor of
 
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:23.270 align:start position:0%
I'd like to recognize honor of
Campbell

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
I have a handout I'd like to hand out
 
00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:29.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
so I've got three minutes so I'll try to
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
make it good I'm packing I've been here
 
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
before I used to serve in House
 
00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
Education uh sponsored a bill a long
 
00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
time ago called House Bill 603 that was
 
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
very similar in that the adequacy follow
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
the student and I think that's really
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here today is
 
00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:52.860 align:start position:0%
should the adequacy money follow the
 
00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
student and I think it should
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
um but when it does I I don't think we
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
should do it at the detriment to our
 
00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
local public schools and especially to
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
our local schools where there's poor
 
00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:06.539 align:start position:0%
kids in those communities I would submit
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
to you that where we're going to see
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
efas if you want to ask the questions
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
are going to be in the school districts
 
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
that are struggling whether those are
 
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
the poor communities or communities that
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
maybe just don't have the best
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
reputation as an educational provider
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
those are probably where you're going to
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
see kids that are going to take
 
00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
advantage of this program and I would
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
hope that all of us would agree that
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing that we should care
 
00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
about all the kids in our state I will
 
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
point out that I think that um this bill
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
is fundamentally fair to lift the income
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
limit and I know representative made a
 
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
great point that we don't means test
 
00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:42.539 align:start position:0%
people get the adequate education grant
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
that go to a government-run local school
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
or a municipal school
 
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
um but we do means to ask kids to get an
 
00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
EFA so you have means testing for one
 
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
kid receiving an adequate education
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
grant and means test no means testing
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
for another kid those kids are similarly
 
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
situated and under our our sense of
 
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:04.740 align:start position:0%
fairness and dare I say our constitution
 
00:23:06.649 --> 00:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
we have to treat people that are
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
similarly situated in a fair way I would
 
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
say right now we have a a constitutional
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
issue that we treat students differently
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
and that's not right we should fix that
 
00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
but in order to fix that I think we have
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
to make the grand compromise so what
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
I've handed out is just a change to the
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
to go along with this bill the bill
 
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
would stay exactly the same way it's
 
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
written you know we're going to lift the
 
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
income limit but I would propose that
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
you would get rid of the term phase out
 
00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
grants in the statute on 194 f
 
00:23:42.409 --> 00:23:42.419 align:start position:0%
and that you would uh payments to
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
students residence districts so again
 
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
understanding education funding we pay
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
as a state for students in Residence and
 
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
that resonance to me is very important I
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
live in Farmington and I would say that
 
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
my local school district is the
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
heartbeat of our community we do a lot
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
of things around our school whether it's
 
00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:01.700 align:start position:0%
Town meetings sporting events Gatherings
 
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
and I had a son who graduated from
 
00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:06.299 align:start position:0%
Farmington High School and I had other
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
children that graduated from St Thomas
 
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
and I had you know as a child myself
 
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
went to both public and private schools
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
and I and I think we just got to respect
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
them equally and understand that that in
 
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
a free Society where you want diversity
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
you want to have these other educational
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
environments and because we haven't
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
funded those other educational
 
00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
environments the Catholic School in my
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
community that was around for 110 years
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
closed this year
 
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
and if we don't change the way we're
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
funding it and we don't start funding
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
these opportunities for Education
 
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
equally we're going to see these really
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
powerful and good institutions continue
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
to close until we have just one option
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
and I would submit to you that we have
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
an oligarchy right now in that most
 
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
students a super majority 90 plus
 
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
percent are in government-run schools
 
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
and that's probably not healthy for our
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
freedom of thought and our stuff so I'm
 
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
asking both sides of the aisle to
 
00:25:00.409 --> 00:25:00.419 align:start position:0%
consider what is there a compromise I
 
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
mean we all come to these committees and
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
we get elected for reasons and you all
 
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
have beliefs and there's nothing wrong
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
with that that's what we should do in a
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
free Society but sir we we have to look
 
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
at a compromise that says how can the
 
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
leader of One party and the leader of
 
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
another party come together and sponsor
 
00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:19.100 align:start position:0%
an amendment and what I've handed out
 
00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
specifically says that eligible students
 
00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:24.419 align:start position:0%
represent package example you've got
 
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
honorable you've gone beyond your time
 
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
okay so you have in front of you the the
 
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
amendment and I just I would like to see
 
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars go to the resident
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
school district for every student that
 
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
gets an EFA I I would like to see that
 
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
continue indefinitely so that the local
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
school district gets points uh gets
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
support if you if one side of the aisle
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
could increase funding for the adequate
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
education grant they would want to
 
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
this is the way you can do that and give
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
the other side of the aisle what they're
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
looking for thank you sir I appreciate
 
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
your questions for honorable Campbell
 
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
guess what represent Woodcock hey Cheryl
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
so let's understand this this two
 
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars will go back to the
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
sending School
 
00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
yes my my proposal that I'm hoping
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
someone on this committee will make an
 
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
amendment would go back to the resident
 
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
District okay so the five thousand
 
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
dollars four thousand dollars whatever
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
it is goes to the EFA student's parents
 
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
and the state would provide an
 
00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:24.539 align:start position:0%
additional 2 000 to the Sunday School to
 
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
replace that is that what you're saying
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
I read that correctly
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
correct so this would be additional
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
State funding that would go specifically
 
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
to the resident District it wouldn't be
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
out of the student's EFA money it would
 
00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
be okay thank you thank you chairman
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
yeah further questions
 
00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:42.539 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:26:42.539 --> 00:26:45.010 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
representative

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:45.020 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
on your second page part three the esa
 
00:26:51.649 --> 00:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
students will be eligible
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
and their residence School part-time and
 
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
participate in all extracurricular
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
activities and sports programs is that
 
00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
meant to be at no additional cost yes
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
that's meant to be at no additional cost
 
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
So currently you you are allowed to do
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
that currently but the district can
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
charge you out of your EFA money to
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
attend that local school district and I
 
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
think that because my children are in
 
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
Residence and because I want the income
 
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
limit lifted it'd be consistent to list
 
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
the income limit but it'd be consistent
 
00:27:21.649 --> 00:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
to say since I have a right to attend
 
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
there I'm not giving you the two
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for nothing I'm saying
 
00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:27.539 align:start position:0%
that you're going to provide services to
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
those students that are in Residence and
 
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
that just clarifies that that two grand
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
is for those students who want to attend
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
part-time maybe one AP class maybe
 
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
playing the basketball team and I think
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
that that's fair and I think that will
 
00:27:42.649 --> 00:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
help communities like Farmington where
 
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
I'm from because we're probably going to
 
00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
see a lot of kids that want to leave if
 
00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:48.539 align:start position:0%
I was going to predict a district that
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
might lead in this category of students
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
that say oh my God have an opportunity
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
to go someplace else it might be a
 
00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
Farmington or a Rochester so I really
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
hope that you'll consider this this what
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
I consider to be a grand compromise and
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
I'm asking all the stakeholders to
 
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
really give it serious consideration
 
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
reach out to me I'd be happy to to meet
 
00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:09.539 align:start position:0%
with any of you I'd be happy to have a
 
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
quick subcommittee on this if that's
 
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
possible but I really think it's worth
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
considering a grand compromise because
 
00:28:18.649 --> 00:28:18.659 align:start position:0%
given our our political climate that's
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
the only way we're going to get stuff
 
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
done just one last thought the pendulum
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
goes like this I don't want it to go way
 
00:28:27.409 --> 00:28:27.419 align:start position:0%
over here or way over there I wanted to
 
00:28:29.149 --> 00:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
just move a little bit and this is just
 
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
a little thing that we can do we can
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
argue about how much money does it save
 
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
or how much money does it cost I think
 
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
there's good arguments on both sides of
 
00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:39.299 align:start position:0%
that but I do think it makes the most
 
00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:42.059 align:start position:0%
sense and will save my community money
 
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
it will say Rochester money we won't
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
have to build hopefully more schools so
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
I hope that you'll give it consideration
 
00:28:51.049 --> 00:28:51.059 align:start position:0%
and I really do appreciate all the hard
 
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
work you guys do I've come down here
 
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
four or five times this year and
 
00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
different matters that I've gotten
 
00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
involved in and I I really appreciate
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
all the time you spend and how much you
 
00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
come down on snowy days so thank you all
 
00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:04.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable camp
 
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm opposed to this bill
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
for several reasons first is the cost
 
00:29:36.289 --> 00:29:36.299 align:start position:0%
estimate on the bill is is misleading
 
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
it's clear that it should start with a
 
00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
baseline of 100 million dollars if the
 
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
20 000 people who currently are either
 
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
homeschooled or in private schools take
 
00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
advantage of the five thousand dollar
 
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
voucher that's a baseline of 100 million
 
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
dollars second it assumes and just skims
 
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
over the whole subject of downshifting
 
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
of costs to local communities it's said
 
00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
that oh it'll be cheaper for the towns
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
because we spend twenty thousand in the
 
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
public school and only five thousand for
 
00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:03.299 align:start position:0%
this but if you lose ten percent of your
 
00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
students in a public school you're not
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
going to really be able to save anything
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
off of your budget you still have your
 
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
fixed costs you're not going to fire any
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
teachers if you lose two students from
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
each classroom and you're certainly not
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
going to fire any paraprofessionals
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
because that's your special ed students
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
and any student that needs a
 
00:30:21.169 --> 00:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional is not going to be
 
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
welcome in these private schools because
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
it would be way too expensive to pay
 
00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
somebody thirty thousand dollars a year
 
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
as a para to work with somebody in
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
special right so this is a huge economic
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
cost that's not adequately stated in the
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
bills as it's presented second this bill
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
will result in the hollowing out of our
 
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
local schools because they will lose
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
money they will not be able to keep up
 
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
with what they're doing they're going to
 
00:30:45.769 --> 00:30:45.779 align:start position:0%
have to cut worthwhile programs that
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars could be spent
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
to do what we were told to do in
 
00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:51.059 align:start position:0%
Claremont decision and we've heard about
 
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
adequate education spend it on the poor
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
schools that need that money now it
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
would make a difference in fact I'll
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
read you one little study here this is a
 
00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
review of 13 studies of whether or not
 
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:03.539 align:start position:0%
money makes any difference in schools
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
and they said it does make a difference
 
00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
in Wisconsin they found that 600 dollars
 
00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
per student especially in low-income
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
districts led to a reduction in the
 
00:31:15.649 --> 00:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
dropout rate by 25 percent in schools
 
00:31:18.049 --> 00:31:18.059 align:start position:0%
getting proficient scores up five to ten
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
percent in Texas they found that a
 
00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars more reduced Dropout
 
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
rates in college enrollment went up nine
 
00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
percent and there's quite a bit more
 
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
studies that I don't have time with only
 
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
three minutes to give you but the point
 
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
is that money he would be better spent
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
in our local schools right now that's
 
00:31:33.649 --> 00:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
the obligation we have under Claremont
 
00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
the next issue was well does this
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
actually increase education for people
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
the studies around the country have
 
00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
found that vouchers reduce educational
 
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
results for the students who leave a
 
00:31:45.409 --> 00:31:45.419 align:start position:0%
public school and go to the private
 
00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:48.059 align:start position:0%
school Diane ravich talks about a study
 
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
of those 20 years worth of results from
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
Professor Cowan large-scale independent
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
studies in DC Indiana Louisiana Ohio
 
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
show that for kids who left Public
 
00:31:59.630 --> 00:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
Schools harmful voucher impacts actually
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
meet or exceed what the pandemic did to
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
test scores meaning that you lose over a
 
00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
third of the year of school by the time
 
00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
you're done being in the voucher
 
00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
programs vouchers do not work you end up
 
00:32:12.649 --> 00:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
getting even worse results lastly I'm
 
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill because it's
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
discriminatory we hear about parents
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
rights there is no parent right if you
 
00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
don't fit into the special categories
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
that of people who can access the
 
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
voucher bills if your child has a
 
00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
disability you're really not going to be
 
00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
welcome in the private schools look at
 
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
the voucher plans six percent of the
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
students are special ed versus eighteen
 
00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:33.539 align:start position:0%
percent in the public schools that's it
 
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
is that my time well okay I'll just
 
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
finish by saying I have there's many
 
00:32:39.169 --> 00:32:39.179 align:start position:0%
groups of people who are not going to be
 
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
eligible to participate but certainly
 
00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:42.419 align:start position:0%
special ed students you have a 300
 
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
difference between the private schools
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
in the special education schools I have
 
00:32:48.889 --> 00:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
uh testimony I'll submit that to you
 
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
tonight by email thank you very much uh
 
00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:54.299 align:start position:0%
any questions for Mr Trimble
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
reps in cordelli uh thank you just on
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
your discrimination comments
 
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
um uh do you know if there are any
 
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
um students with special needs who are
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
participating in the EFA program yeah
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
the statistics say that six percent of
 
00:33:12.889 --> 00:33:12.899 align:start position:0%
the students in the FEA program are
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
considered special education in the
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
public schools that number is 18 that's
 
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
a 300 percent difference the other thing
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
that's that my comment is about in
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
specific is this is that if you have a
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
child who has a complex special
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
education issue or is going to be
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
expensive that child has to be educated
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
in the public schools the public schools
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
educate every single child regardless of
 
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
expense but in the private school
 
00:33:39.649 --> 00:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
they're not going to take a child who's
 
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:41.220 align:start position:0%
going to cost them thirty thousand
 
00:33:42.649 --> 00:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
dollars a year to have a one-on-one
 
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional because that's in
 
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
excess of the total tuition amount so
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's not if you want the argument
 
00:33:51.169 --> 00:33:51.179 align:start position:0%
has been made today it's not fair to
 
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
keep our money away from the private
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
schools in the religious schools if you
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
want it to be fair and equal then the
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
private and the religious schools should
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
agree to abide by all of the state
 
00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:03.059 align:start position:0%
regulations no discrimination on the
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
basis of 193.38 and they should agree to
 
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
give every student who applies a free
 
00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:09.899 align:start position:0%
and appropriate education
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you so then for those
 
00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:17.060 align:start position:0%
private schools for instance that
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
maybe cannot accommodate all students
 
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
should the state provide them funny
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
funding so they can accommodate those
 
00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:27.419 align:start position:0%
students like they do with Public
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
Schools then basically you're turning
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
that into a public school and if that's
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
what you want to do then I would say we
 
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
heard friendly amendments I would
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
propose friendly amendments to this bill
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
that the charter I mean at the private
 
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
schools would agree to educational
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
accountability that they would agree to
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
abide by 193.38 no discrimination for
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
any reason they would agree to special
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
education and they will begin you would
 
00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
also make sure that you don't have an
 
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
adverse effect on the local schools with
 
00:34:55.369 --> 00:34:55.379 align:start position:0%
downshifting if you're willing to make
 
00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
religious schools say I will only take
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
EFA money if I I will agree to no
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
discrimination special education and
 
00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
educational accountability then let's
 
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
see which schools sign up for this plan
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
further questions represent McDonald
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
testimony once again
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
um with all due respect could you please
 
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
direct me to a point in this bill or
 
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
within the EFA chapter where the word
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
voucher is used because to my
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
understanding the word voucher does not
 
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
appear in the EFA RSA and therefore the
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
statistics you cited about voucher plans
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
across the country would not apply to
 
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so could you just clarify
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
that please okay I I understand that
 
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
this state is what we're calling it an
 
00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:43.079 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account in Indiana
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
they use something similar uh I'm sorry
 
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
education savings account uh it was
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
called the Indiana Choice legislation
 
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:53.579 align:start position:0%
the terms are slightly different in in
 
00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
different states and the emphasis is now
 
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.510 align:start position:0%
different states and the emphasis is now
become

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
become
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
to emphasize the word choice because the
 
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
the policy argument that it was help
 
00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
education was proven to not be effective
 
00:36:04.609 --> 00:36:04.619 align:start position:0%
so therefore we switched over to the
 
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
argument of choice for parents so we
 
00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
call them Freedom or Choice accounts but
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
the the educational system basically
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
where the government says to a parent
 
00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
we'll give you this amount of money you
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
go find a private school that you want
 
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
to send your child to and we'll pay for
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
it that basic formula applies whether
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's called a voucher in in District of
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
Columbia or Louisiana or whether it's
 
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
called a choice legislation in Indiana
 
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.220 align:start position:0%
or it's called an education Freedom
 
00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
account in New Hampshire the function is
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
basically the same
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome further
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
are you aware that the
 
00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
um the way an EFA Works in New Hampshire
 
00:36:47.089 --> 00:36:47.099 align:start position:0%
is very different from just giving you
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
some money to go to another school that
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
it can be used for a wide variety of
 
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
things tutoring books
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
um and a a complex system where you get
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
some classes here some classes there
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
what works for a student which is quite
 
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
different than
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
here's some money go find a different
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
school I'm sorry I didn't really speak
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
completely when I answered that question
 
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
I was just trying to explain that the
 
00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
research on vouchers is relevant to New
 
00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but if you look at the other
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
states they end up as these programs
 
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
have evolved they're not that much
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
different from what you're describing
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire it's not just I
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have said here's money go to a
 
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
private school that was kind of the the
 
00:37:30.109 --> 00:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
original decades ago when they first
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
started but in all these states it's
 
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
evolved to a multitude of different ways
 
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
to spend that money so I think what
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
we're doing here under the EFA plan is
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
not dramatically different than what's
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
been tried in other states
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
representative Bruno thank you very much
 
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and this is a follow-up sort of
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
to representative Lucas's um uh question
 
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
and um and you know and I think I I I
 
00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
know I agree with with you in using the
 
00:37:59.329 --> 00:37:59.339 align:start position:0%
term voucher because I think that
 
00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
generically applies across the board to
 
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
these types of similar programs you know
 
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
in um uh in other states but um but
 
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
unlike some other states are you aware
 
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
that as as representative ligas
 
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
suggested that that New Hampshire
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
actually has a kitchen sink clause and
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's um in the in the voucher
 
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
um uh statue which essentially allows
 
00:38:26.569 --> 00:38:26.579 align:start position:0%
the uh the uh the contractor to approve
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
any um any expense it um it deems fit I
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
see what you're saying so that this the
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
family can use it to expand their
 
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
internet at home or to buy a computer
 
00:38:38.569 --> 00:38:38.579 align:start position:0%
for their child or you can I think
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
become even more more imaginative on on
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
on expenses too but but but it's called
 
00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
a kitchen a kitchen sink Clause right I
 
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
mean it but the thing is that if your
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
family can afford to use the five
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for that
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
and still attend a private school then
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
you're in a situation where you're
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
financially successful enough to be able
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
to do that but this five thousand
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
dollars won't if you if you can't afford
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
to do that and you have to use every
 
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
penny to pay tuition to a private school
 
00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be able to do it
 
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
unless you're of a certain level means
 
00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:14.099 align:start position:0%
the the average price of
 
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
tuition in private schools in New
 
00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for elementary schools is 11
 
00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
000 and for high schools is nineteen
 
00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
thousand so even if you get five
 
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
thousand off of that at high school
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
level you're talking fourteen thousand
 
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
more dollars if you have two children
 
00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
that's twenty eight thousand dollars a
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
year on top of your regular expenses
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
this plan I was trying to get to
 
00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
discrimination on income as well as
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
special ed but on income if you don't
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
have twenty eight thousand dollars extra
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
in income you can't really meaningfully
 
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
participate in this program so you have
 
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
parental rights for those who don't who
 
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
have a child who doesn't have a
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
significant special education need and
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
if you have enough income you can
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
participate but a lot of people would be
 
00:39:59.170 --> 00:39:59.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
thanks so so I I agree with with all of
 
00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:04.740 align:start position:0%
that in terms of the the additional
 
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
tuition costs and and participation
 
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
where you can where you can afford it
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
but um but is is there actually a
 
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
requirement that that you have that you
 
00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:17.220 align:start position:0%
have to attend school at all
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
um uh in the in the compulsory
 
00:40:22.849 --> 00:40:22.859 align:start position:0%
attendance uh requirements can uh I
 
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
don't honestly know I mean I think you
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
can do homeschooling in which case you
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
have to submit a plan
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
um but right but but but isn't it true
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
though that the that the EFA EFA program
 
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
yeah follow-up thank you Mr chair isn't
 
00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
it true that the EFA program has a has
 
00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:41.220 align:start position:0%
um basically waives the compulsory
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
attendance requirement and that simply
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
having an EFA satisfies the compulsory
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
attendance requirement I'm not qualified
 
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
to answer I think somebody from the doe
 
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
would be better in qualified for that
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
one I'm not going to take any more
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
questions right now at this uh
 
00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
particular uh person testifying Mr
 
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
Trimble thank you very much thank you Mr
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for helping
 
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
me speak this morning my name is Serena
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
Varley and I live in Concord I have
 
00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
seven kids
 
00:41:28.859 --> 00:41:29.589 align:start position:0%
seven kids
um

00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:31.190 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
we have been working on educating all of
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
them we have done many different things
 
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
over the years we've done public school
 
00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:40.220 align:start position:0%
private school home school
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
and I am here in support of this bill I
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
think in order to provide an adequate
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
education for all New Hampshire students
 
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
we should offer education free Freedom
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
accounts to every child in New Hampshire
 
00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
um and remove the cap
 
00:41:59.089 --> 00:41:59.099 align:start position:0%
uh just to give you a little background
 
00:42:02.569 --> 00:42:02.579 align:start position:0%
I grew up in Vermont and was and
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
benefited from what was essentially an
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account I went to a
 
00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:09.140 align:start position:0%
private school
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
and actually went to Dartmouth College
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
afterwards and I think without the
 
00:42:16.849 --> 00:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
ability to do that Vermont traditionally
 
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
offered this kind of program for about
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
over 100 years and without that
 
00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
opportunity I don't think I would have
 
00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
been able to succeed like I did
 
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
educationally I think New Hampshire has
 
00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:31.550 align:start position:0%
educationally I think New Hampshire has
um

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
an interest in giving an adequate good
 
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
education to every New Hampshire student
 
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
and that it should not be
 
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
mean space at all
 
00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:46.130 align:start position:0%
mean space at all
and

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:48.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
I think that um
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
going back to what Mr Trimble said I I
 
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
disagree with him because I think the
 
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of an educational Freedom
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
account was for the success of students
 
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
and not for the success of schools and
 
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
that anything that we can do as a state
 
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
to support students we should do and not
 
00:43:13.089 --> 00:43:13.099 align:start position:0%
have a means tip means test
 
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
the other thing I wanted to mention is
 
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.770 align:start position:0%
that we have
um

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
like somebody else mentioned we have all
 
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
we all pay taxes we've paid taxes all
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
these you know for we've lived in
 
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
Concord for over 20 years we've paid
 
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
taxes and we
 
00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:30.230 align:start position:0%
taxes and we
um

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
we think that that it's only right that
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
as a New Hampshire taxpayers we should
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
um benefit just like every other student
 
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
in every other family in New Hampshire
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
can and have the same opportunities that
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
every other New Hampshire
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
student has to education
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:55.319 align:start position:0%

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
participated in public and private
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
parochial on efas do you have any
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%

chair welcome further questions from the
committee

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay thank you uh
 
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
thanks for having me Kate Baker Demers I
 
00:44:41.569 --> 00:44:41.579 align:start position:0%
run the current EFA program and so I
 
00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
came today
 
00:44:44.569 --> 00:44:44.579 align:start position:0%
um to answer any questions that anyone
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
has about what this might look like I
 
00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
also um have the opportunity to answer
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
the telephone at Children's scholarship
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
fund and I spoke to a family last week
 
00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
who is a widowed woman with one child
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
and she asked me unfortunately what are
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
the income limits on the program her
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
income is 59 000 and the income is 54
 
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
000 and she's hoping that her son can
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
participate in a hybrid program and she
 
00:45:14.089 --> 00:45:14.099 align:start position:0%
doesn't know how she's going to pay for
 
00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:16.859 align:start position:0%
the hybrid program and so I would just
 
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
encourage you to consider any move
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
towards increasing the income limits or
 
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
removing the income limits because there
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
are families that have need and they do
 
00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:29.339 align:start position:0%
contact us you know not overwhelmingly
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
so I don't know again what the what it
 
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
would look like if that existed but I do
 
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
know that anytime you put an income
 
00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:37.140 align:start position:0%
limit on something you've got people
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
that are one or two dollars over there
 
00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
was just a couple of things I heard
 
00:45:43.609 --> 00:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
earlier in this discussion there's been
 
00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
a lot of talk about dollars and costs
 
00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
and I understand that you know this is a
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
policy committee not the finance
 
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
committee but you still end up getting
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
stuck on that a lot and I would just
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
encourage you to consider that children
 
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
are not funding units
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
but rather humans and children and so
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
when you're thinking about funding
 
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
children I I understand you tend to get
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
caught up on that cost issue but in fact
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
you know they're not funding units to be
 
00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
assigned in essence by or where we think
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
they should go but rather children
 
00:46:17.569 --> 00:46:17.579 align:start position:0%
trying to get educated and their parents
 
00:46:19.849 --> 00:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
you know know them best and so I would
 
00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
just encourage that the other thing I
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
heard again was to talk about special
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
education today and about 51 of our out
 
00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:29.220 align:start position:0%
of District placement schools in New
 
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for special ed kids with
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
extreme special needs are private
 
00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
schools and so I just wanted to throw
 
00:46:37.609 --> 00:46:37.619 align:start position:0%
that out there in addition the
 
00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
discussion about discrimination you know
 
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
when I walk up to the door of a public
 
00:46:44.809 --> 00:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
school my kids also attended public
 
00:46:47.329 --> 00:46:47.339 align:start position:0%
school they didn't ask me if I was 300
 
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
percent of the poverty limit or below to
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
go there they just said you're welcome
 
00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
to come and so I do think that again
 
00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
children are not funding units there are
 
00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
quite a few family these that have
 
00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
distinct need who fall one or two
 
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
dollars over the income limits we have
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
now and I definitely support this this
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
discussion support this idea of of
 
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
increasing or removing the income limits
 
00:47:11.809 --> 00:47:11.819 align:start position:0%
from the program thank you very much are
 
00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:12.839 align:start position:0%
there questions from the community
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative parano
 
00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:17.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
for taking my question there was a
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
comment earlier about
 
00:47:22.079 --> 00:47:23.349 align:start position:0%
comment earlier about
um

00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:25.849 --> 00:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account funds being
 
00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
used for internet but I'm looking
 
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
through your vendor list and I'm not
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
seeing any internet so in the rules the
 
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
department of Ed said had to be 51 for
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
the child and so what you can do is get
 
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
a hot spot it's not as effective as as
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
covering the cost of household internet
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
but because the rules defined it as
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
the internet cost has to be 51 used by
 
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
the child it's impossible to pay for
 
00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
household internet it has to be a hot
 
00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
spot I mean I I don't I think you should
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
be able to use it for internet because
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
again when this bill was passed it was
 
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
in the midst of the pandemic and the
 
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
shutdown and there were families who
 
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
didn't have technology a computer
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
internet or access to it and I think
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's why the legislators put it in the
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
bill so that families could have access
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
to computers technology tutors when
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise their school was closed and in
 
00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
essence though when they passed the
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
rules they narrowed it so that's why
 
00:48:28.089 --> 00:48:28.099 align:start position:0%
you're seeing that
 
00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
representative uh Damon
 
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
my question yeah you're welcome
 
00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
it's puzzling to me that the current EFA
 
00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
program does not appear to have anywhere
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
near the same accountability or
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
measurement of outcomes proficiencies as
 
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
the public school systems are required
 
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
to do could you speak to why we would
 
00:48:53.569 --> 00:48:53.579 align:start position:0%
fund more students into a program
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
without that so I do think that taking a
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
standardized test is similar So a family
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
in the EFA program has to take a
 
00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
standardized test and turn it in that is
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
similar to what they do in the public
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
schools where students are required to
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
take the Statewide assessment and so I
 
00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
don't see very much difference at all in
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
that regard
 
00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
thank you quick follow-up
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
where is the data on those outcomes the
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
test scores are aggregated and then that
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
data is given to the Department of Ed
 
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Myler
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%

um nice to see you children's
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund so here's a question
 
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
for you okay great that's been in the
 
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:47.220 align:start position:0%
back of my mind
 
00:49:50.569 --> 00:49:50.579 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that uh vouchers
 
00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
can be utilized by a public school
 
00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
student going to another public school
 
00:49:59.690 --> 00:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
student a school is that correct yes
 
00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:02.220 align:start position:0%
although again a voucher would be the
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
department of Ed paying a private school
 
00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account you know
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
the philosophy is going into the parent
 
00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
account and I you know I don't I don't
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
need to get into that but in essence the
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
parent is directing the money and yes
 
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
they can direct that money to pay a
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
public school for classes courses when
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
there are some kids full-time as a
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah so my child happens to be
 
00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
a special education child yeah the
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
special education services
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
so if my child moves from school
 
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
district Public School District a to
 
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
public school district B and needs those
 
00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:38.579 align:start position:0%
sped Services who is responsible for
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
providing those sped services so it
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
looks like there's a student just like
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
this in our program and it looks like
 
00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
the district that they move to is giving
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
them Services well it's not the resident
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
School District correct the resident
 
00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.589 align:start position:0%
School District correct the resident
District

00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
District
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
um has that you know because they know
 
00:50:58.609 --> 00:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
they're in a different district and so
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
it seems like the different district is
 
00:51:03.049 --> 00:51:03.059 align:start position:0%
providing those Services I think also
 
00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
that the department of Ed or the State
 
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
Board of Ed put that in the rules that
 
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
if you move to a different school with
 
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
an IEP your IEP continues in the school
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
the family is paying the district from
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account so the Pat
 
00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:30.020 align:start position:0%
the family's paying for it it looks like
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
and this is uh this is an important
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
distinction thank you and uh thanks for
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
this clarification no problem but I
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
don't mind if if the uh services
 
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
are more than what the vouchers paying
 
00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:43.730 align:start position:0%
are more than what the vouchers paying
for

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
who pays for the balance
 
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
of that in this particular student's
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
case the parent is paying additional
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
money plus the scholarship plus the
 
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account to cover the
 
00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
cost this is this they're paying for the
 
00:52:00.049 --> 00:52:00.059 align:start position:0%
extra special education service I don't
 
00:52:02.569 --> 00:52:02.579 align:start position:0%
know they call it tuition at the
 
00:52:02.579 --> 00:52:04.190 align:start position:0%
know they call it tuition at the
district

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
representative Allison did that help
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative Milan okay okay thank you
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
question okay uh you started with an
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
example of a a family a woman and a
 
00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
child around 59 000. uh
 
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
is it your belief that a family that has
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
an income of two hundred thousand
 
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
dollars a year should be eligible for an
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
EFA I mean I'm going to go out on wild
 
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
limb and tell you yes because if I had
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
an income of two hundred thousand
 
00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
dollars I could enroll in a neighborhood
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
public school and they wouldn't tell me
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
to pay I mean in essence you know if you
 
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
believe in funding the child which I do
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
and think that every child should have
 
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
you know the freedom to choose whichever
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
building works for them or in the case
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
of a medically fragile child during
 
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:53.220 align:start position:0%
covid that couldn't go into a building
 
00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
I'm also for that child being able to be
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
educated outside of a building and in
 
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
essence for the money to follow the
 
00:53:03.049 --> 00:53:03.059 align:start position:0%
child I don't think it should be litmus
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
test by any income level follow up yes
 
00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.510 align:start position:0%
test by any income level follow up yes
uh

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:11.339 align:start position:0%
taking a step forward further if this
 
00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:13.140 align:start position:0%
family earns three quarters of a million
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
dollars or should they be yellow Jewel
 
00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:17.339 align:start position:0%
for an EFA I think so yes thank you yeah
 
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:19.140 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say there aren't very many
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire in the income
 
00:53:22.609 --> 00:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
bracket the other thing I noticed is
 
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
that you know the families do have to
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
jump through a bunch of Hoops to be in
 
00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
this program and
 
00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
um extremely affluent people don't need
 
00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
to jump through our Hoops they're just
 
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
going to do what they want to do anyway
 
00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
you know in essence families in that
 
00:53:38.089 --> 00:53:38.099 align:start position:0%
income bracket have always had school
 
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
choice and always will have school
 
00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
choice because they can send their kids
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
to whatever school they want to go to
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
and so I feel like the likelihood of
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
them jumping through my you know Hoops
 
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
would be low and or I would agree that
 
00:53:55.069 --> 00:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
every child should be have their
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
education funding representative dry
 
00:53:59.210 --> 00:53:59.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question you're welcome uh do
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
any of the non-public schools that
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
accept efa's have means tests of their
 
00:54:07.849 --> 00:54:07.859 align:start position:0%
own for students
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
so you're saying non-public schools so
 
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
you're asking about private schools I
 
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
mean many of them do have some internal
 
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
financial aid but there aren't any that
 
00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
are specifically for a particular income
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
group does that answer the question like
 
00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
all the schools are open to all children
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh follow up please yes all right I
 
00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:28.859 align:start position:0%
actually want my question would be
 
00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
I do know for example if you go to St
 
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
Paul's and you earn
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
um 80 000 or below you get a full
 
00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:38.329 align:start position:0%
um 80 000 or below you get a full
scholarship

00:54:38.329 --> 00:54:38.339 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
okay so is that how let's speak to maybe
 
00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
that is 80 000 and above they would not
 
00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
be eligible for scholarships it's there
 
00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
would that be something that might uh
 
00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
open it up to everybody but may if
 
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
you've applied according to
 
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
um the means for that particular school
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
with that maybe make it open to everyone
 
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
um make it
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
applicable to you know to people who
 
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:07.140 align:start position:0%
don't need the money yeah I don't think
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
people that don't need the money are
 
00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:10.140 align:start position:0%
going to come and do all of the work
 
00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
associated with it but I do think that
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people or rather a
 
00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
group of people in that gap of
 
00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
middle-income families you know
 
00:55:20.809 --> 00:55:20.819 align:start position:0%
particularly since the economy is so
 
00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:22.980 align:start position:0%
difficult it seems like I'm hearing from
 
00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
more families that are just slightly
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
over the income limit discussing what
 
00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
they wish they could do but they can't
 
00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
do or discussing need that they may have
 
00:55:34.849 --> 00:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
and so I just feel like
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
in essence when we talk about this
 
00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
adequate education grant I agree with
 
00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:41.579 align:start position:0%
you know earlier that it's for
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
every child in the state and so I don't
 
00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:46.220 align:start position:0%
think limiting it by a particular
 
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
demographic really makes sense thank you
 
00:55:52.329 --> 00:55:52.339 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock thank you chairman uh
 
00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
how are you well we'll know what I mean
 
00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
I guess yeah nice to see you uh I want
 
00:55:59.089 --> 00:55:59.099 align:start position:0%
to follow up with President Milo's
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
question I I think I just want to be
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
sure I hear what you said but correctly
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
I wrote it down but I'm not sure hero
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
correctly I think his question was if a
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
student in public school a special
 
00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
education student yeah takes a a voucher
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
or if anyone who takes the opportunity
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
it goes to public school B yeah doesn't
 
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
reside there because I think the words
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
you use move to but I'm in public school
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
a yeah I decide to go to have my
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
youngster go to public school B and they
 
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
have special education services
 
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
requirements that are extraordinary
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
right okay who is which public school is
 
00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
responsible for paying those
 
00:56:41.329 --> 00:56:41.339 align:start position:0%
so the parent is paying the cost at the
 
00:56:41.339 --> 00:56:42.890 align:start position:0%
so the parent is paying the cost at the
school

00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
so so I I'm having a difficult time I
 
00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
think understanding where you're going
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
with the questions well yeah because in
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
this case this families are paying the
 
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
school tuition
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
and so in my experience whether a child
 
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
with special needs goes to a private
 
00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
school or a public school
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
the tuition doesn't necessarily change
 
00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
and so when a child goes to a private
 
00:57:08.809 --> 00:57:08.819 align:start position:0%
school and they have special needs the
 
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
private school still charges the tuition
 
00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
that they charge and at a public school
 
00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
they're doing the same thing so they're
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
just charging their family their tuition
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
that's just to clarify I wasn't talking
 
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
about tuition I'm talking about the
 
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
expensive especially saving expense for
 
00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
that youngster if you look at it public
 
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
school is uh twenty seven thousand
 
00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
dollars sure any movies any move to
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
public school would be because they like
 
00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:33.300 align:start position:0%
they like that public school yeah I mean
 
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
travels there it doesn't live there yeah
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
so it's public school be paying the 29
 
00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
000 for that service or is public school
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
a where he came from I don't I guess I
 
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know because the parent is
 
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
paying what the school tells them to pay
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
so the school says the cost to come here
 
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
is X is it probably 20 000 and then the
 
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
parent pays the tuition I think the
 
00:57:56.329 --> 00:57:56.339 align:start position:0%
school considers that comprehensive of
 
00:57:59.210 --> 00:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
every service they provide usually thank
 
00:58:01.309 --> 00:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
you does that help no but thank you oh
 
00:58:03.609 --> 00:58:03.619 align:start position:0%
okay am I missing something you guys
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative vladim I missing
 
00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:09.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
I think with that same question is going
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
to go over and over and over some people
 
00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
are going to see resolution to it others
 
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
are not okay um I'm just wondering am I
 
00:58:21.049 --> 00:58:21.059 align:start position:0%
missing the point of it you might not
 
00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
answer enough no okay thank you for uh
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question it was brought up
 
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
um the idea of somebody with a three and
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
a half million dollar income possibly
 
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
using this program obviously some
 
00:58:35.089 --> 00:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
concern that they would be unnecessarily
 
00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
taking from this program we obviously
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
don't use income as our funding
 
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
mechanism in this state we use property
 
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
um so let's substitute 3.5 million for
 
00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
property can you imagine how or estimate
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
how many EFA programs a person with a
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
3.5 million dollar property you paying
 
00:58:56.089 --> 00:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
taxes on it might be funding in this
 
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
state of course it depends on the town
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
right and so if you're in a low tax town
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
like Newberry right you might be paying
 
00:59:07.069 --> 00:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
for what 200 kids efas and if you're in
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
a in a all right lower well if your
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
property tax is higher you'd be paying
 
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
for more kids if your property tax is
 
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
lower although you know what I gotta
 
00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
just pull you aside because this money
 
00:59:21.289 --> 00:59:21.299 align:start position:0%
is just State money your swept stays
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
local and you're so in essence a
 
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:26.700 align:start position:0%
property taxpayer isn't paying for any
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
of these kids because your swept is
 
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:32.460 align:start position:0%
local and a credit okay so your swept
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
stays in your town as a credit against
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
money that your the state would pay and
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
you all your property tax stays local
 
00:59:43.849 --> 00:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
and so I gotta correct you a property
 
00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
taxpayer in any Town wouldn't pay for
 
00:59:47.809 --> 00:59:47.819 align:start position:0%
any of these children the money for
 
00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:49.140 align:start position:0%
these children comes from the general
 
00:59:51.289 --> 00:59:51.299 align:start position:0%
fund which moves into the education
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
trust fund and the general fund is
 
00:59:55.849 --> 00:59:55.859 align:start position:0%
funded by business taxes business
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax meals and rooms tax real
 
01:00:02.089 --> 01:00:02.099 align:start position:0%
estate those kinds of taxes and so I I
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
there you go that's fair thing okay
 
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:05.700 align:start position:0%
you're welcome I'd like to just caution
 
01:00:07.609 --> 01:00:07.619 align:start position:0%
the committee here I'm very way off top
 
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
topic where yes we went way off the
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
topic here and we need to hold to the
 
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
policies associated with
 
01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:17.540 align:start position:0%
lifting the cap
 
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
when we get into a specific taxes and
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
swept and finances leave it for fiscal
 
01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:26.579 align:start position:0%
later please if there is another
 
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
committee with that responsibility
 
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative balbooni
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
please thank you chairman thank you for
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question you said earlier in
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
response to another question that the
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
any child could attend any school with
 
01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
an EFA but don't certain private schools
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
religious schools have admission
 
01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.250 align:start position:0%
religious schools have admission
requirements

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:00:51.289 --> 01:00:51.299 align:start position:0%
so at this point because student
 
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
population is declining by so much I'm
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
finding schools recruiting you might see
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
weird admissions requirements in some of
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
the more like St Paul's type schools but
 
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
in your everyday little low-cost private
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
schools they're accepting everyone that
 
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
comes and recruiting and trying to get
 
01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
more kids and so I understand you're
 
01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:14.339 align:start position:0%
thinking maybe about Merit like St
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
Paul's or Phillips Exeter those schools
 
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
are always going to have those types of
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
Niche markets but they also don't need a
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
family's money from an education Freedom
 
01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
account because they have their own
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
endowments so follow up
 
01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
sorry follow up to that one okay say you
 
01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:32.220 align:start position:0%
had a Saint Paul's and everything are
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
the kids right now that have efas using
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
them at St Paul's there aren't
 
01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.289 align:start position:0%
them at St Paul's there aren't
no

01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:39.299 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome represent
 
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
for taking my question a number was
 
01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
thrown out earlier of a hundred million
 
01:01:50.329 --> 01:01:50.339 align:start position:0%
dollars of all private and homeschoolers
 
01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
applied that would be the cost of this
 
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
okay but you said that there is an
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
extensive process to apply and therefore
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
people who really do not need this um to
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
fund their child's education would not
 
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
so therefore could we assume that the
 
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
price tag would actually be less if this
 
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
I mean again there isn't any real way to
 
01:02:12.289 --> 01:02:12.299 align:start position:0%
project you can look at what's happened
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
in other states in programs where they
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
have no income limits and they see the
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
uptake at like five percent of the
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
general population so if you think about
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
it this way I mean 95 of the kids in New
 
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire attend a public school right
 
01:02:29.089 --> 01:02:29.099 align:start position:0%
and about five percent do something
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
different I don't know why we would
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
expect that trajectory to change because
 
01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
you make more opportunities most of the
 
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
families that come to us are you know
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
kids that experience bullying
 
01:02:44.809 --> 01:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
our special needs children who feel like
 
01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
their needs are not being met in the
 
01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
public school they want to opt out and
 
01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:50.460 align:start position:0%
do something totally different maybe pay
 
01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
for their services kids that are below
 
01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:55.140 align:start position:0%
grade level significantly and the family
 
01:02:56.809 --> 01:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
feels like they need a smaller class
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
size we also hear from children who are
 
01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
significantly above grade level and they
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
feel like they need to do something
 
01:03:03.599 --> 01:03:04.789 align:start position:0%
feel like they need to do something
different

01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
in essence that's where most of the
 
01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
families come from and so it's
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable to think it will be a certain
 
01:03:14.089 --> 01:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
percentage of the population that
 
01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
chooses it but most people that I talk
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
to are happy with their local public
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
school and would probably stay there as
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact we see children come to
 
01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
us sometimes for a smaller Elementary
 
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
School experience and then go to their
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
local public high school because that's
 
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
what they want to do we also see
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
families in this program choosing to go
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
to public school with with some of the
 
01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:38.579 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account money and use
 
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
it so to me I always see it as a both
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
and it seems like your discussions on
 
01:03:46.089 --> 01:03:46.099 align:start position:0%
this committee tend to be very either or
 
01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
where you're thinking that this program
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
is the opposite of attending a public
 
01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
school and so in your mind you're asking
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
yourself how many kids would leave a
 
01:03:58.609 --> 01:03:58.619 align:start position:0%
public school and in essence perhaps you
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
should be asking yourself how many
 
01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
people might choose to go instead to a
 
01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:05.339 align:start position:0%
public school with this money for for a
 
01:04:08.089 --> 01:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
specialized program I I don't know that
 
01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
either or it doesn't necessarily make
 
01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
sense when the program is both and that
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
helps a lot thank you for other
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
questions represent Hall thank you Mr
 
01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for being here and
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question so just a quick
 
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
question do you believe that all
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
students will receive public money
 
01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:26.339 align:start position:0%
should be held to the same standards and
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
regulations so I don't know what you
 
01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:30.839 align:start position:0%
mean by that question because I know for
 
01:04:30.839 --> 01:04:31.789 align:start position:0%
mean by that question because I know for
example

01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
um there was a district where there were
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
children scoring at like 20 percent
 
01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
proficient meaning to me that like 80
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
percent of the kids were not at grade
 
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
level and so I don't know what what
 
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
standard you would want to apply to them
 
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
to say if that should apply to everyone
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
so I don't think we have a universal
 
01:04:55.329 --> 01:04:55.339 align:start position:0%
standard you know my one of my children
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
went to high school in in Bedford New
 
01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that school is a high
 
01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
performing school where the standards
 
01:05:04.849 --> 01:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
are are high and everyone's test scores
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
are high are would you want to apply
 
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
that standard to everyone in the state
 
01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
or would you want to take a a struggling
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
District where for example the children
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
are you know speak a thousand languages
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
and are our free reduced lunch I mean
 
01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
those kids I don't want to say they
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
should have a different standard but in
 
01:05:24.289 --> 01:05:24.299 align:start position:0%
essence I I don't I don't know what
 
01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
standard we would apply to all children
 
01:05:29.329 --> 01:05:29.339 align:start position:0%
equally to be able to make it make sense
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
I guess great well I would actually
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
think okay say State testing for example
 
01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
the state test what I say I mean I like
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
the idea in the education Freedom
 
01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
account where the family takes a
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
standardized test of their choice or can
 
01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
have a portfolio evaluation I feel like
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
particularly for children with special
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
needs or if you have a child who um
 
01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
isn't for example is an English language
 
01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
learner perhaps they would want to use
 
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
the portfolio evaluation have their
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
portfolio evaluated by someone who
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
speaks their language and so I like the
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
diversity in that the family can say
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
this is the assessment that we think
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
works for our child I think that's good
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
in essence I trust families and it this
 
01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:16.140 align:start position:0%
program trusts families to say that they
 
01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
should be in in the driver's seat and so
 
01:06:21.049 --> 01:06:21.059 align:start position:0%
I think if the parent says this is what
 
01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
is the right thing for my child then we
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
should support that and I think that's
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
more important accountability if the
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
family doesn't feel like this is working
 
01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
for them they'll leave and they'll go do
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
something else you know similarly to you
 
01:06:35.809 --> 01:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
know how a charter school works if it's
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
not performing well the families will
 
01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
leave and not go to that charter school
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
and it will close and so I feel like
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
that's good good accountability or
 
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
rather authentic accountability
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay further questions representative
 
01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:48.829 align:start position:0%
okay further questions representative
cardelli

01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
cardelli
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chairman thank you uh
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
um in terms of other states that have a
 
01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
universal education savings accounts
 
01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.150 align:start position:0%
universal education savings accounts
yeah

01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
um I think West Virginia is up and
 
01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:01.970 align:start position:0%
um I think West Virginia is up and
running

01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
running
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
um this year for the first year it took
 
01:07:06.529 --> 01:07:06.539 align:start position:0%
them a year to get up and running for
 
01:07:08.329 --> 01:07:08.339 align:start position:0%
some reason
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
um do you have any idea the number of
 
01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
students who have signed up in West
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
Virginia for those accounts and what
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
percentage that might be well that's a
 
01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
good question so I do know how many I
 
01:07:21.529 --> 01:07:21.539 align:start position:0%
know they started with their opening
 
01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
group was 1600 and then they got to 3
 
01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
000 and again the West Virginia program
 
01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
has no income limits on it and so that's
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli's question is
 
01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
what does a program look like when there
 
01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
are no income limits they have twice the
 
01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
population of us per you know so we have
 
01:07:41.809 --> 01:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
a million people in our state and they
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
have about 2 million and again they were
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
at sixteen hundred and three thousand so
 
01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:47.700 align:start position:0%
their program actually is the same size
 
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
as ours even with no income limits
 
01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
further questions represent luno thank
 
01:07:56.809 --> 01:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair to the um to the
 
01:07:58.849 --> 01:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
comment you made um just a few moments
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
ago with respect to authentic
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
accountability and uh parents who who
 
01:08:05.569 --> 01:08:05.579 align:start position:0%
pull their children out of their public
 
01:08:09.170 --> 01:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
school to to go to that I mean that it
 
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
it it seems like we're ignoring the 800
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
pound gorilla of the approximately 3 200
 
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
students in the program maybe there's
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
only about a hundred where where parents
 
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
made an affirmative decision to leave
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
their Public Schools so that the the um
 
01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
you know remarks that we heard from
 
01:08:32.329 --> 01:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
from former member Campbell and and your
 
01:08:35.209 --> 01:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
early remarks with respect to uh to
 
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
students actually exiting their Public
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
School really does seem like the
 
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
minority because of the 3200 at least
 
01:08:45.169 --> 01:08:45.179 align:start position:0%
like 3 100 were either already in
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
um private schools or home schools are
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
going to go to private or home schools
 
01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
anyway so so when when when you look at
 
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
income eligibility and I want to get it
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
back to the to the point of this bill
 
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm I'm I'm looking looking
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
through what where where these students
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
are currently going uh prior to taking
 
01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
the um the uh joining the EFA program
 
01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
um how how relevant is the income
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
eligibility to uh to school choice
 
01:09:26.530 --> 01:09:26.540 align:start position:0%
I don't understand the question
 
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
with 3 100 students either already go
 
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
into private school or home school or
 
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
going to go to private or home school
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
anyway only about a hundred students
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
actually making a decision to leave
 
01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
their public school and and go to uh go
 
01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
to a private school and
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
um uh so so for the program as a whole
 
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
where most of these students already in
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know private or home school
 
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
environments are going to go anyway how
 
01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
relevant is the income eligibility or
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
lack thereof
 
01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:09.900 align:start position:0%
um in this to um uh to uh to school
 
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
choice okay I understand the question
 
01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:13.130 align:start position:0%
choice okay I understand the question
now

01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
um so again I see this as a both and not
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
in either or and so you're definitely on
 
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
the either or team representative Luna
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
where you're looking at it as a child
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
go for words in my mouth okay sorry just
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
talk about what what what you believe
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay the opportunity that's created by
 
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
lifting the cap and how that applies to
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
the the 100 students ish that make an
 
01:10:44.689 --> 01:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
affirmative decision to leave public
 
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
school because of the voucher and the
 
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
approximately 3 100 students
 
01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
um ish that were already in private or
 
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
home school environments or going to go
 
01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
that way anyway family history of doing
 
01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
that what you know what whatever their
 
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
reasons so so I'm just trying to
 
01:11:05.689 --> 01:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
understand where how the how the lifting
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
of the calf so getting back to the core
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
of this bill how that applies to the
 
01:11:13.729 --> 01:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
majority students who are already in
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
non-public school options versus the
 
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
very small percentage that are in public
 
01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
school and um and how that income
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
lifting the income cap
 
01:11:25.679 --> 01:11:26.390 align:start position:0%
lifting the income cap
um

01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
how that matters to these these two
 
01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:29.930 align:start position:0%
how that matters to these these two
different

01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
um groups great happy to answer your
 
01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
question thank you so much for the
 
01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:34.850 align:start position:0%
question thank you so much for the
question

01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
um again I do see this as a both and and
 
01:11:40.850 --> 01:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
so of the 3200 children that are
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
currently in the program the department
 
01:11:45.410 --> 01:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
of Ed's calculation was that 42 percent
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
of them had been in public school at
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
some point
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
um and then also there's a group of
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
children to your point in that 3200 and
 
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
we are choosing to go to a public school
 
01:11:58.610 --> 01:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
with the EFA dollars in that group of
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
families the 3200
 
01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
um there were 337 families that were
 
01:12:06.410 --> 01:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
over the income limit and so I know that
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
in discussing the income limits and
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
removing them or increasing them it
 
01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:15.179 align:start position:0%
would provide opportunity to those 337
 
01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
families who applied who were over the
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
income limits
 
01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
um I think that answers the question yes
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
um just I'm I'm willing to let it go
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
okay questions
 
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much oh you're welcome uh
 
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
uh chairman she she had to leave and she
 
01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
passed around I didn't know she left
 
01:12:48.189 --> 01:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
uh Sarah Scott
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
same thing she just walked out the door
 
01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
she will submit testimony okay
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:00.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
at wchr
 
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
um w-e-h-r okay and my handwriting is
 
01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:11.930 align:start position:0%
um w-e-h-r okay and my handwriting is
bad

01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
bad
 
01:13:14.689 --> 01:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Jenny landra um I have
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
three children
 
01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
um and uh as we're having children my
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
husband and I um we're constantly
 
01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
talking that schools are our biggest
 
01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
concern for our children
 
01:13:26.689 --> 01:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
um education is extremely important to
 
01:13:26.699 --> 01:13:28.010 align:start position:0%
um education is extremely important to
us

01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:13:29.689 --> 01:13:29.699 align:start position:0%
um and once we moved
 
01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
um we moved to a local public school
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
because of their school ratings or
 
01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
public school ratings
 
01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
um and once we started our oldest
 
01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
daughter into the public school
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
um we were shocked with how little Focus
 
01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
was on academics
 
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
um we were shocked at how kids were
 
01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
already bullying and being bullied in
 
01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
the first grade
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
um our daughter would come home and tell
 
01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
us about
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
um all the bullying and having to like
 
01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
kids would schedule time for each other
 
01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.050 align:start position:0%
kids would schedule time for each other
recess

01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
recess
 
01:13:55.729 --> 01:13:55.739 align:start position:0%
um and how if one child acts out in the
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
class the teacher spends all of her time
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
dealing with that child and takes away
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
from the rest of the class so she was in
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
a first grade class of like 20 to 22
 
01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
kids and so she was just getting lost
 
01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
our daughter was bullied she was shy
 
01:14:11.330 --> 01:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
it just wasn't working so um we were
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
shocked and we decided to pull our kids
 
01:14:15.649 --> 01:14:15.659 align:start position:0%
out of the local schools uh the local
 
01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
public schools and I was extremely
 
01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
shocked as to how few people asked why
 
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
even the principal who I worked with
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
monthly and others when told
 
01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
um said I understand I think school
 
01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
choice is the only answer to this
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
problem if people get to take their
 
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
money with their child to whatever
 
01:14:33.649 --> 01:14:33.659 align:start position:0%
School works best for them then this
 
01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
will force the public schools to step up
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
their game there's currently no
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
incentive or competition to be better
 
01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
and most people can't afford what we've
 
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
done and it's sad that they can't and we
 
01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
are right above the income threshold so
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
we aren't able to take advantage
 
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:48.649 align:start position:0%
we aren't able to take advantage
um

01:14:48.649 --> 01:14:48.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
of any money and I just don't think that
 
01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
that's fair and I know people that are
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
in the same boat and the kid just can't
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
afford it they can't afford especially
 
01:14:56.570 --> 01:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
when we have three kids it's a lot of
 
01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:57.830 align:start position:0%
when we have three kids it's a lot of
money

01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:01.550 align:start position:0%
money
um

01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
so let's see
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
um I think allowing parents to put their
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
children in the best situation for their
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
child should be everyone's top priority
 
01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
children are our future
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
um and this is what our tax dollars are
 
01:15:12.169 --> 01:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
meant for why should a child be stuck
 
01:15:13.729 --> 01:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
bullied every day with no hope of a
 
01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
brighter future why should a child that
 
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
thrives in education be stuck being
 
01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
bored in public schools because they
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
require kids to stay at the same level
 
01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
unless they decide differently why
 
01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
should the parent have to watch their
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
child go into a classroom hide in the
 
01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
corner because they're shy and the
 
01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
teacher can't manage the large amount of
 
01:15:27.719 --> 01:15:28.729 align:start position:0%
teacher can't manage the large amount of
kids

01:15:28.729 --> 01:15:28.739 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
I think school choice is the best for
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
everyone and I don't think that there
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
should be a cap on how much you make
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that
 
01:15:47.689 --> 01:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
you would actually prefer to have your
 
01:15:50.209 --> 01:15:50.219 align:start position:0%
child in the public school if the
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances were different but because
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
of what you experienced there
 
01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
you pulled your child out and you're if
 
01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing correctly you think there
 
01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
are other families that might be in that
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
situation who would be willing to take
 
01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
advantage of the education Freedom
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
accounts correct to protect their
 
01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
children yeah so I mean uh just a long
 
01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:08.990 align:start position:0%
children yeah so I mean uh just a long
story

01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
story
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
um my husband and I actually lived um on
 
01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
the west coast and the schools were
 
01:16:15.050 --> 01:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
there over there were terrible and so
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
when our children were getting to the
 
01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
age where they were going to come to
 
01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
Public Schools we then reached out and
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
we looked in New Hampshire and
 
01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts are one of the top schools
 
01:16:24.169 --> 01:16:24.179 align:start position:0%
in the country and so that's why we
 
01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
moved to New Hampshire so we moved here
 
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
to go to the public schools we were both
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
kind of against private schools just
 
01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
because we wanted our kids to know the
 
01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
local kids and and things like that but
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
then it just wasn't a good fit for our
 
01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:35.930 align:start position:0%
then it just wasn't a good fit for our
kids

01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:16:38.330 --> 01:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
yeah further questions
 
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody thank you for the
 
01:16:52.610 --> 01:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
time uh Peter Serrato
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
um I live in Bedford we moved there a
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
few years ago I have on a 11 and 13 year
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
old in the public schools so um I'm
 
01:17:03.169 --> 01:17:03.179 align:start position:0%
right in the throes of it if you will
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
um we moved to Bedford for the schools
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
primarily we moved from Massachusetts
 
01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.169 align:start position:0%
primarily we moved from Massachusetts
um

01:17:09.169 --> 01:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
and we are seriously considering moving
 
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:14.940 align:start position:0%
our kids from the public schools and I'm
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
more of a data real world example type
 
01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
of person so you know everyone's touched
 
01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
on most of the topics but um
 
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
so people believe Bedford schools are
 
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
one of the best in New Hampshire right I
 
01:17:28.729 --> 01:17:28.739 align:start position:0%
think we're a top five if um not
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
mistaken but did you know that our math
 
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
proficiency proficiency at the high
 
01:17:36.649 --> 01:17:36.659 align:start position:0%
school 41 of the kids are below grade
 
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
level 41 that's almost half
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
we don't even have spelling words in
 
01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
Bedford my kids have been in Bedford
 
01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
since fourth grade we have no spelling
 
01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
words no just not part of the curriculum
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
unbelievably so
 
01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
um you know at 20 000 per year I believe
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
is what you said each student is no
 
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
spelling words how are the kids going to
 
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
be able to spell well they can't
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
um I was going through some other local
 
01:18:05.209 --> 01:18:05.219 align:start position:0%
schools like Manchester Central High
 
01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
School 70 of the kids are below
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
Proficiency in math 70 percent
 
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
58 for ELA 42 in math
 
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
um we're at
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
a level one meaning I don't know they
 
01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
just put their name on the test
 
01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
you know they're not even close to
 
01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:24.709 align:start position:0%
you know they're not even close to
proficiency

01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
proficiency
 
01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
we've got Nashua High School South 63
 
01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
are below proficiency math 40 below in
 
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
the UI
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
Londonderry 58 Below in math
 
01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
um 33 in ela I mean these are these are
 
01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
disgraceful numbers
 
01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
like I assume everyone's goal here is to
 
01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
make sure our kids get the best
 
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
education they can is there any
 
01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
accountability in these Public Schools
 
01:18:52.669 --> 01:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
really they've already got our money you
 
01:18:53.810 --> 01:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
know I've
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
um in fifth grade I asked for my sons
 
01:18:58.370 --> 01:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
the curriculum I said could I please
 
01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
have the approved curriculum
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
and to my surprise he said what do you
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
mean by approved and I was like what do
 
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
you mean like the approved curriculum I
 
01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
couldn't get it they would not give it
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
to me they sent me a list of like 20
 
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
books from the Wonders Ela program
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
and that's just academics
 
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
if you want to get into like the real
 
01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:18.649 align:start position:0%
if you want to get into like the real
nitty-gritty

01:19:18.649 --> 01:19:18.659 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
um last year we've been noticing a lot
 
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
of I would say inappropriate books and
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
materials in the school of particularly
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
the library so this book Lawn Boy I
 
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if anyone's familiar with it
 
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
um you know it has depictions of 10 year
 
01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
olds giving each other's oral sex
 
01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:37.250 align:start position:0%
olds giving each other's oral sex
um

01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
the word you know the way the f word is
 
01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.689 --> 01:19:47.699 align:start position:0%
97 times the word asked 20 times 60
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
times no not exactly a literary piece so
 
01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
one parent just um asked to have it
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
removed from the library because it's
 
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
inappropriate which I wholeheartedly
 
01:19:58.610 --> 01:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
so there was a this whole big long
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
process they put together a panel the
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
panel approved it superintendent said it
 
01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
was great and the school board said it
 
01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
was great we can't get out of the school
 
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
so basically you can't get any book out
 
01:20:11.050 --> 01:20:11.060 align:start position:0%
of the school they can order from Amazon
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
any sexually explicit book no problem
 
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
they're not going to pull it out so what
 
01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
am I supposed to do as a parent
 
01:20:20.689 --> 01:20:20.699 align:start position:0%
like we're we're trying to figure out
 
01:20:22.850 --> 01:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
how financially we're going to afford to
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
send our kids to private school wrap it
 
01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
up please yes I will
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
um I was on the library last night
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
and this book isn't enough
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
in the library handmaid's tale it's the
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
Hulu show if anyone knows it's ready to
 
01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
mature this is a graphic novel
 
01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
you know it's got pictures of like girls
 
01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
being raped
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
this picture
 
01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
of this old guy he's pulling up his
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
pants after you raped the girl this is
 
01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
for 14 year olds at our school
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
so what am I supposed to do as a parent
 
01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.570 align:start position:0%
so what am I supposed to do as a parent
here

01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
like we things need to change this is
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
not acceptable the schools are not
 
01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
accountable they already have our money
 
01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
you know efas are they the primary
 
01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:04.739 align:start position:0%
solution I think it's a big step in the
 
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
right direction and this is just a state
 
01:21:08.090 --> 01:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
money even if you've got to wrap it up
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
please all right I'm sorry
 
01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
um so I wholeheartedly support this if
 
01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
anyone has any questions
 
01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
feel free to take them thank you very
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
much are there questions from the
 
01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
committee representative Balboni
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
so Sharon thank you for taking my
 
01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
question I saw that you pulled up a lot
 
01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
of statistics on proficiency numbers and
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
everything and these were all from
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
public schools in your research are you
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
able to find any um comparable
 
01:21:31.729 --> 01:21:31.739 align:start position:0%
statistics for the private schools of
 
01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or the religious schools
 
01:21:37.729 --> 01:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
um I didn't look that up honestly
 
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing you thank you very
 
01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:11.270 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman LED members of the
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
committee I am pleased to be here to
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
address you this morning on HB 331 I'm
 
01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
going to try not to repeat uh all that's
 
01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
been said already about this proposal to
 
01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
remove the income caps on the state's
 
01:22:29.209 --> 01:22:29.219 align:start position:0%
Voucher Program
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
but I will reflect a little bit on some
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
things I have heard I've heard that this
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
should be about the students and um oh
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
by the way just to back up a little bit
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
I am the President of the American
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
Federation of teachers New Hampshire and
 
01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
I represent about 4 000 members who work
 
01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
in K-12 schools across the state as well
 
01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
as in public universities and in public
 
01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
service and among us we work with about
 
01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
29 000 of the 165 000 public school
 
01:22:58.850 --> 01:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
students across the state and apparently
 
01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
should be about students and what they
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
need and I want to say that every single
 
01:23:06.410 --> 01:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
public school student in the state
 
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
should have those small class sizes that
 
01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
we heard
 
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
um a previous speaker talking about so
 
01:23:14.450 --> 01:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
they can get the individual attention
 
01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
from a teacher
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
or the learning support from a para
 
01:23:19.850 --> 01:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
educator to get exactly what they need
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
so they can do their best learning
 
01:23:24.350 --> 01:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
and in order to do that we need the
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
people in this building
 
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
or in the building across the street
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
to fulfill their constitutional Duty
 
01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
to provide an adequate public education
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
because that's what's in the New
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution you have to
 
01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
provide it you have to fund it and I
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
know you've got a lot of bills in front
 
01:23:44.450 --> 01:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
of you this year trying once again to
 
01:23:46.729 --> 01:23:46.739 align:start position:0%
solve that problem this bill doesn't get
 
01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
you any closer to it
 
01:23:50.689 --> 01:23:50.699 align:start position:0%
your constitutional duty is to a public
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
education parents can make other choices
 
01:23:54.890 --> 01:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
they certainly have every right to do
 
01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:55.610 align:start position:0%
they certainly have every right to do
that

01:23:55.610 --> 01:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:56.689 align:start position:0%
that
but

01:23:56.689 --> 01:23:56.699 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:23:58.610 --> 01:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
you do not have a constitutional
 
01:24:00.649 --> 01:24:00.659 align:start position:0%
obligation to fund that
 
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
and when the legislature two years ago
 
01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:06.550 align:start position:0%
and when the legislature two years ago
passed

01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
passed a law
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
creating the voucher program
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.209 --> 01:24:20.219 align:start position:0%
obligation that is being contested in
 
01:24:20.219 --> 01:24:21.590 align:start position:0%
obligation that is being contested in
court

01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
this will increase that funding
 
01:24:27.770 --> 01:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
obligation without making the legality
 
01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
of it any clearer
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
so you need to keep that in mind and as
 
01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
we've heard there are 15 000 students
 
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
sixteen thousand students in public
 
01:24:40.010 --> 01:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
school plus another you know five
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
thousand or so that could take advantage
 
01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
if the income limits are removed from
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
the voucher program so that is a big
 
01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
obligation even though we are supposed
 
01:24:57.169 --> 01:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
to keep policy separate from Finance you
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
can't do that because the money does
 
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
come from the taxpayers
 
01:25:02.689 --> 01:25:02.699 align:start position:0%
and it's got to come from somewhere
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
there's no Magic Money Tree but just
 
01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
imagine you are a single mother in
 
01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:08.770 align:start position:0%
imagine you are a single mother in
Hudson

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:08.780 align:start position:0%
Hudson
 
01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
you are paying your mortgage your bills
 
01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
your taxes because your taxes do indeed
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
fund the public schools you've gone
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
beyond three minutes okay I will wrap it
 
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
up you like that your students are going
 
01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
to Auburn High School and they are
 
01:25:24.649 --> 01:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
getting their AP U.S history they are
 
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
also able to take carpentry at the CTE
 
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
program there but now your taxes are
 
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
going up because you are going to fund
 
01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
you know someone sending their kid to
 
01:25:36.110 --> 01:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
Phillips Exeter
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
and what do you do do you sell your home
 
01:25:39.770 --> 01:25:39.780 align:start position:0%
and move
 
01:25:42.290 --> 01:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
this is not fair it's a giveaway thank
 
01:25:44.209 --> 01:25:44.219 align:start position:0%
you very much do you have written
 
01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
testimony it's coming around
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh do you care take any questions
 
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
I will entertain questions I don't know
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
if I'll have the answers but I will talk
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%

thank you for uh testifying but I just
 
01:25:59.810 --> 01:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify for transparency
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
purposes am I correct that you currently
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
have an active lawsuit against the
 
01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
commissioner in this program I do yes
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
over the mechanism for funding the
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
program thank you it should not come out
 
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
of the education trust fund that is for
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
public education
 
01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
further questions represent Belcher
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just wanted to
 
01:26:20.209 --> 01:26:20.219 align:start position:0%
clarify the position
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
um what do you would you suggest that
 
01:26:25.129 --> 01:26:25.139 align:start position:0%
students using the EFA program either in
 
01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:27.780 align:start position:0%
public I'm sorry either in a private or
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
home school environment are not
 
01:26:37.490 --> 01:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
is to provide
 
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
an adequate public education I am not
 
01:26:43.729 --> 01:26:43.739 align:start position:0%
saying anything about the adequacy of
 
01:26:46.129 --> 01:26:46.139 align:start position:0%
other forms of Education okay so I I
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
would suggest that that was not an
 
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
accurate summary of what I said
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
now further questions
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'd like to invite
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Mary Wilke I'm from
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
Concord um and I oppose HB 331
 
01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
am I I saw somebody looking forward can
 
01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
you hear me
 
01:27:22.129 --> 01:27:22.139 align:start position:0%
okay thanks
 
01:27:22.139 --> 01:27:23.110 align:start position:0%
okay thanks
um

01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
as others have alluded to the vast
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
majority of people who have taken efas
 
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
so far had students who were already in
 
01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
private or home school without using
 
01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
afas that wasn't the premise under which
 
01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
the EFA program was sold to was sold in
 
01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
the first place
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
and go back to 2017 when SB 93 was under
 
01:27:44.450 --> 01:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
consideration and then right up through
 
01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
2021 when the current program was
 
01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:47.510 align:start position:0%
2021 when the current program was
adopted

01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
opponents consistently made the argument
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
that the program was needed for kids who
 
01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
did not fit in the public school or
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
whose needs were not being met there
 
01:27:57.649 --> 01:27:57.659 align:start position:0%
the people who came to testify in favor
 
01:28:00.169 --> 01:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
of the program were parents were mostly
 
01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
parents of children who were in public
 
01:28:03.290 --> 01:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
school or had recently been in public
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
school and were having problems there or
 
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
had special needs that weren't being met
 
01:28:10.610 --> 01:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
in the parents opinion he didn't hear
 
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the program saying that it
 
01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
was needed to help private schools by
 
01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
substituting State scholarships for the
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
scholarships the private schools were
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
already giving
 
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
we didn't hear sponsors saying that efas
 
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
were needed to help wealthy parents
 
01:28:24.649 --> 01:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
continue to send those to their children
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
to private schools or to help children I
 
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
mean excuse me to help parents who have
 
01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
access to a public school that would
 
01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
meet all the academic needs of their
 
01:28:34.129 --> 01:28:34.139 align:start position:0%
children but wanted instead of religious
 
01:28:35.629 --> 01:28:35.639 align:start position:0%
education and wanted the state to pick
 
01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
up the tab
 
01:28:39.169 --> 01:28:39.179 align:start position:0%
but that's what's happened and about 80
 
01:28:41.330 --> 01:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
percent of efas have gone to families
 
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
that were already in private or home
 
01:28:46.129 --> 01:28:46.139 align:start position:0%
school without any help from the state
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
the majority of them apparently from
 
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
what I can tell from the doe records
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
have never tried public school so the
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
program has strayed far from the course
 
01:28:56.930 --> 01:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
of its original intent and eliminating
 
01:28:58.970 --> 01:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
the financial eligibility requirement
 
01:29:00.890 --> 01:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
would make it straight even farther
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
others have talked about how many
 
01:29:05.209 --> 01:29:05.219 align:start position:0%
students are currently in private and
 
01:29:07.850 --> 01:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
home schools and how if they all took in
 
01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
the fa that would end up costing the
 
01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
state somewhere in the neighborhood of
 
01:29:13.570 --> 01:29:13.580 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars a year
 
01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
others say that they won't all take it
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
if they won't know if it's going to be a
 
01:29:20.330 --> 01:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
five percent take-up rate then maybe
 
01:29:22.129 --> 01:29:22.139 align:start position:0%
there should be a cap because right now
 
01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
this if this bill passes as it is the
 
01:29:26.810 --> 01:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
state will be liable all the way up to
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
that hundred million dollars
 
01:29:32.209 --> 01:29:32.219 align:start position:0%
if there's 100 million dollars available
 
01:29:35.810 --> 01:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
to help kids in K-12 education a more
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
efficient way to address the issues that
 
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
brought efas to the table in the first
 
01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
place the fact that some children in
 
01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
some Public Schools were not getting
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
their needs met the better way would be
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
to give more money to the public schools
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:54.169 --> 01:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
um after all giving an EFA to a child
 
01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
whose needs aren't met in a public
 
01:29:57.410 --> 01:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
school does nothing for the children who
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
remain in that public school thank you
 
01:30:01.250 --> 01:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes representative
 
01:30:04.610 --> 01:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
luno so thank you very much Mr chair
 
01:30:06.649 --> 01:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Ms Wilke so is there
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
a policy distinction then for a policy
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
committee when considering lifting a cap
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
that um that could um
 
01:30:18.290 --> 01:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
open an opportunity for uh for a student
 
01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
who's currently in a public school to uh
 
01:30:25.370 --> 01:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
to seek other options versus uh uh
 
01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
lifting the cap and providing
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
a tuition rebate taxpayer-funded tuition
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
rebate for uh families with kids that
 
01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
were already in private and homeschool
 
01:30:40.010 --> 01:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
environments are there is there a policy
 
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
distinction there I think there is and I
 
01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
think all hearings and testimony I
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
listened to study in 2017 the focus was
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
always on kids in public schools who for
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
one reason or another were not getting
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
their needs met and um you know I think
 
01:30:57.229 --> 01:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
that's that was the policy I was led to
 
01:31:00.490 --> 01:31:00.500 align:start position:0%
believe was motivating people who were
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
sponsoring these bills and supporting
 
01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:04.010 align:start position:0%
sponsoring these bills and supporting
them

01:31:04.010 --> 01:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:31:06.649 --> 01:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
further questions not see any thank you
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
very much thank you Mary uh last card we
 
01:31:20.290 --> 01:31:20.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Jane Bergeron
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of the New
 
01:31:26.209 --> 01:31:26.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of special ed
 
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
administrators and I hadn't uh intended
 
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
to testify today
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
um but I'm representing special ed
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
administrators from across the state we
 
01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
have over 280 members who are leaders in
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
the field of special education I just
 
01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
thought it would be important for the
 
01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
committee to get some clarification on a
 
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
question that was brought forward
 
01:31:49.149 --> 01:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
earlier in the discussion this morning
 
01:31:49.159 --> 01:31:51.070 align:start position:0%
earlier in the discussion this morning
around

01:31:51.070 --> 01:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
students who have efas who are going
 
01:31:57.290 --> 01:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
from one public school to another as
 
01:31:59.870 --> 01:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
recent as last Friday the Bureau of
 
01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
special education the administrator of
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
the bureau did inform us that if a child
 
01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
has an EFA and they go to a public
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
school outside of their residence it is
 
01:32:15.169 --> 01:32:15.179 align:start position:0%
the resident School District who is
 
01:32:17.810 --> 01:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
programmatically and financially
 
01:32:21.050 --> 01:32:21.060 align:start position:0%
responsible for all aspects of the
 
01:32:24.530 --> 01:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
child's IEP including Transportation so
 
01:32:27.129 --> 01:32:27.139 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to put that out to you
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
according to the bureau administrator
 
01:32:32.450 --> 01:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
this guidance came from the office of
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
special education services in Washington
 
01:32:38.450 --> 01:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
and so we've asked for written
 
01:32:39.890 --> 01:32:39.900 align:start position:0%
documentation on that but I thought it
 
01:32:41.930 --> 01:32:41.940 align:start position:0%
would be important for you to have that
 
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
question answered
 
01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
01:32:47.209 --> 01:32:47.219 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for
 
01:32:51.169 --> 01:32:51.179 align:start position:0%
clarifying that you're welcome because I
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
know representative Mila has started
 
01:32:54.649 --> 01:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
with it and I I got confused hearing the
 
01:32:56.090 --> 01:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
answer and I thought well if you just
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
said was accurate uh in my mind before
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
he said that so thank you so much so
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
just so does in my brain if I'm in
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
school a it's a public school I'm
 
01:33:07.010 --> 01:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
getting significant special education
 
01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
services from the staff and in that
 
01:33:10.850 --> 01:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
public school district and I go to
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
public school district B in another town
 
01:33:14.810 --> 01:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
I still live in a
 
01:33:16.970 --> 01:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
Public School A is responsibly
 
01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:19.139 align:start position:0%
extraordinary Capital Transportation yes
 
01:33:21.010 --> 01:33:21.020 align:start position:0%
very similar to a charter school model
 
01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you so much I appreciate it thank
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
you chairman representative luno thank
 
01:33:27.410 --> 01:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
you very much uh Mr chair and thank you
 
01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
very much Ms Bergeron for um for that
 
01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:30.950 align:start position:0%
very much Ms Bergeron for um for that
clarification

01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:33:32.990 --> 01:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
um is that response where is that
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility spelled out and does it
 
01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
have a Nexus to either state or federal
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
law we've asked for that documentation
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
we've been told it comes from the office
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
of special ed programs out of Washington
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
um it was further noted we're going to
 
01:33:51.229 --> 01:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
have to do the research to get that
 
01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
because it was further noted that the
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
department couldn't provide it because
 
01:33:58.510 --> 01:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:02.219 align:start position:0%
of quick follow-up so we're we're we're
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
sure though that there's no Nexus to
 
01:34:08.689 --> 01:34:08.699 align:start position:0%
state law in in are we sure that there's
 
01:34:11.450 --> 01:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
no Nexus to state law either the 194 F
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh that established the efas or in any
 
01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:15.229 align:start position:0%
uh that established the efas or in any
other

01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:34:17.149 --> 01:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
to our knowledge like I said we just
 
01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
learned of this Friday
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
um and so we're still doing our research
 
01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
okay thanks very much
 
01:34:26.689 --> 01:34:26.699 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank you thank
 
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I just want
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
to be clear about the financial part of
 
01:34:32.930 --> 01:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
it if you can answer so a student who
 
01:34:35.450 --> 01:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
lives in Manchester and goes to
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
Londonderry who receives extensive
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
special ed but uses your EFA to pay for
 
01:34:42.770 --> 01:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
Londonderry the special ed services
 
01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
don't come out of their EFA they get
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
charged to Manchester and the
 
01:34:50.090 --> 01:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
transportation that's what it was
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
explained to us okay thank you very much
 
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative pattern
 
01:34:59.629 --> 01:34:59.639 align:start position:0%
so back to representative woodcock's
 
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
explanation because A and B is easier
 
01:35:05.570 --> 01:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
than naming districts could School B
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
refuse the student
 
01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:09.380 align:start position:0%
or do they have to receive the student
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know I I think that that's a
 
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
question for the school boards and
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
superintendents in terms of policy and
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
what is their policy on accepting
 
01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:19.380 align:start position:0%
students I know they can't discriminate
 
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
against the child with an IEP
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
um certainly I would imagine they could
 
01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
have a policy saying that they're not
 
01:35:27.729 --> 01:35:27.739 align:start position:0%
taking any EFA
 
01:35:30.169 --> 01:35:30.179 align:start position:0%
enrollments I don't know
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
we we've had that uh statutory issue
 
01:35:37.610 --> 01:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
come up years ago if they're a open
 
01:35:39.410 --> 01:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
enrollment school that's a different
 
01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
deal however the working superintendent
 
01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
superintendent the superintendent in the
 
01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
receiving District can say no we're not
 
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
accepting any students from school
 
01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
district a that came down years ago and
 
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
I believe it's still in statute I
 
01:35:59.330 --> 01:35:59.340 align:start position:0%
haven't been here to see it changed so
 
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli uh thank you I think
 
01:36:04.129 --> 01:36:04.139 align:start position:0%
that that also applies to the Manifest
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
education hardship best answer to the
 
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
child where we did have example
 
01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:10.860 align:start position:0%
um a child was denied admittance to a
 
01:36:13.850 --> 01:36:13.860 align:start position:0%
neighboring school district and had an
 
01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.050 align:start position:0%
neighboring school district and had an
IEP

01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
IEP
 
01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:17.390 align:start position:0%
IEP
representative

01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:36:21.050 --> 01:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
for taking my question my name is
 
01:36:23.810 --> 01:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
similar but mine is more refers to a
 
01:36:25.610 --> 01:36:25.620 align:start position:0%
private out of District placements
 
01:36:26.930 --> 01:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
because I'm not really sure how this
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
works if you had a child who labeled
 
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
special needs in your district and that
 
01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
child chose to take an EFA and attend a
 
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
private school
 
01:36:40.689 --> 01:36:40.699 align:start position:0%
that may or may not provide special
 
01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
services does the home District still
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
have to provide special education
 
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
services for that child once they leave
 
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
the school I would have to get
 
01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
clarification on that when we were just
 
01:36:54.669 --> 01:36:54.679 align:start position:0%
talking public school to public school
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:59.689 --> 01:36:59.699 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Damon
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:37:03.169 --> 01:37:03.179 align:start position:0%
my question it's helpful to have your
 
01:37:03.179 --> 01:37:04.330 align:start position:0%
my question it's helpful to have your
input

01:37:04.330 --> 01:37:04.340 align:start position:0%
input
 
01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
so you indicated that what you just
 
01:37:11.450 --> 01:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
explained was detailed to you on Friday
 
01:37:14.570 --> 01:37:14.580 align:start position:0%
is it different than what you understood
 
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
prior to that is this something new we
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
hadn't really even had conversations
 
01:37:21.410 --> 01:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
about efas going public school to public
 
01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:22.970 align:start position:0%
about efas going public school to public
school

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
um this is a new situation it's come up
 
01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
a couple times it's presented conflict
 
01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
um it's yeah been cause for legal action
 
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
and so we reached out and said we need
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
some guidance
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
um and that's how the conversation
 
01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
started thank you you're welcome further
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
01:37:45.890 --> 01:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
very much thank you
 
01:37:47.450 --> 01:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm going to close this
 
01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:48.649 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm going to close this
hearing

01:37:48.649 --> 01:37:48.659 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
and we're going to take a five minute
 
01:37:53.450 --> 01:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
break for those that need to get up in
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
and the next bill we will be going into
 
01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:08.050 --> 01:38:08.060 align:start position:0%
and we'll get right back
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:22.679 --> 01:47:43.370 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:47:43.370 --> 01:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:46.010 --> 01:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
could go that easily so uh and people
 
01:47:48.530 --> 01:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
across the state for sure so um so
 
01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
thanks very much members of the
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
committee this um the bill before you
 
01:47:56.570 --> 01:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
right now Hospital 432 addresses the uh
 
01:48:00.410 --> 01:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
the same section of law uh in the
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts as the uh the
 
01:48:05.209 --> 01:48:05.219 align:start position:0%
prior bill that we just um uh just
 
01:48:08.330 --> 01:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
discussed uh it doesn't do anything
 
01:48:12.530 --> 01:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
thing with respect to the um the the
 
01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:14.870 align:start position:0%
thing with respect to the um the the
income

01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:48:18.050 --> 01:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
eligibility percentage it leaves that
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
part uh the same and I know there's
 
01:48:23.209 --> 01:48:23.219 align:start position:0%
there's other bills including the uh
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
well there's other bills that we've seen
 
01:48:28.189 --> 01:48:28.199 align:start position:0%
that that do increase the uh the income
 
01:48:30.410 --> 01:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
eligibility this is this doesn't touch
 
01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:31.850 align:start position:0%
eligibility this is this doesn't touch
that

01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:34.850 --> 01:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
um but um but it what it what it does do
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to um uh a student's
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
eligibility for the program is uh is put
 
01:48:45.290 --> 01:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
in place an annual uh income uh
 
01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
recertification process so that a
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
student's family would every year be uh
 
01:48:54.890 --> 01:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
be re-certified uh that there or have
 
01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
their income recertified to be within
 
01:48:59.689 --> 01:48:59.699 align:start position:0%
the the limits uh required of the
 
01:49:03.050 --> 01:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
program whether that's 300 percent as in
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
current law uh which is about ninety
 
01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or 350 percent as I
 
01:49:10.370 --> 01:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
think an amended bill
 
01:49:13.490 --> 01:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
has some or an amendment to a bill has
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
suggested be about 105
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
000 or 500 percent which would be a
 
01:49:21.169 --> 01:49:21.179 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty thousand so um so like
 
01:49:23.810 --> 01:49:23.820 align:start position:0%
I said 432 doesn't make any change to
 
01:49:26.510 --> 01:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
that number just uh puts in place the
 
01:49:30.590 --> 01:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
the annual uh income recertification and
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
um and it also so just sort of looking
 
01:49:36.109 --> 01:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
at um at at the bill that's what it's
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
doing in um in the first section and in
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
the second section it uh it simply talks
 
01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
about uh what happens to an EFA account
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
um uh in the event
 
01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
um the student becomes ineligible so
 
01:49:52.609 --> 01:49:52.619 align:start position:0%
their family no longer qualifies due to
 
01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
uh their annual uh income and um and in
 
01:49:58.850 --> 01:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
that case unused funds revert back to
 
01:50:02.090 --> 01:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund so um so that's
 
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
really that's really the bill in the
 
01:50:07.129 --> 01:50:07.139 align:start position:0%
nutshell uh I believe what we heard last
 
01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
week from the governor signaled support
 
01:50:12.830 --> 01:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
for reusable guard rails on education
 
01:50:15.649 --> 01:50:15.659 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts and annual income
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
recertification is certainly one of
 
01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
those reasonable guard rails we do it
 
01:50:24.129 --> 01:50:24.139 align:start position:0%
the um the the state and federal
 
01:50:27.530 --> 01:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
programs do it in a number of different
 
01:50:30.530 --> 01:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
areas whether that's housing whether
 
01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's SNAP benefits whether that's
 
01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.270 align:start position:0%
that's SNAP benefits whether that's
Medicaid

01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
and on and on as far as annual
 
01:50:40.609 --> 01:50:40.619 align:start position:0%
recertification of income they don't
 
01:50:42.530 --> 01:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
just test once and then let it go open
 
01:50:44.109 --> 01:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
loop forever
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
you test every year and make sure that
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
the family still qualifies and that's
 
01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:50.820 align:start position:0%
all we're we're talking about here
 
01:50:54.050 --> 01:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
reasonable guard rails for um for efas
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
and um and with that I'll take uh you
 
01:50:59.629 --> 01:50:59.639 align:start position:0%
know I'll take a couple of quick
 
01:51:01.010 --> 01:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
questions but hopefully we can get back
 
01:51:03.770 --> 01:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
on track too thanks represent dry thank
 
01:51:05.330 --> 01:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking a
 
01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:06.530 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking a
question

01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
um when our family sponsored Cambodian
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
Refugee uh she and her family were on
 
01:51:14.689 --> 01:51:14.699 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for a while the problem we
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
found was that every time that her
 
01:51:19.010 --> 01:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
income went up a little bit her benefits
 
01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
declined and she really never gained any
 
01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
traction at that point I'm wondering if
 
01:51:26.450 --> 01:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
if someone goes out of the 300 percent
 
01:51:29.390 --> 01:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
over property level by a little bit and
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
is not eligible for the program they
 
01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
really haven't gained enough to make up
 
01:51:34.490 --> 01:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
the Lost ground that they would lose
 
01:51:38.450 --> 01:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
from losing an EFA so so I think and
 
01:51:40.970 --> 01:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank thanks for the for the I there's a
 
01:51:45.070 --> 01:51:45.080 align:start position:0%
question packed in there and and yeah
 
01:51:48.770 --> 01:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
so but I I I I I do know I do understand
 
01:51:50.810 --> 01:51:50.820 align:start position:0%
though that um that the federal
 
01:51:53.810 --> 01:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
guidelines do get updated every year so
 
01:51:56.930 --> 01:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
that as as people's income you know
 
01:51:59.870 --> 01:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
Grows by by one or two percent a year
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know whether they're uh you know
 
01:52:05.149 --> 01:52:05.159 align:start position:0%
government employee or they're on
 
01:52:06.890 --> 01:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
um you know they're they're they're in a
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
private company and they're getting a
 
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
one two or three percent uh on income
 
01:52:14.570 --> 01:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
adjustment the the guidelines keep Pace
 
01:52:17.209 --> 01:52:17.219 align:start position:0%
with that what the guidelines don't do
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
is is keep Pace with significant changes
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
in income so so should a family's income
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
go up by 50 or 100 percent do it due to
 
01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
a change in job or due to some other
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
circumstance uh the family is is is
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
clearly beyond what the what the income
 
01:52:40.729 --> 01:52:40.739 align:start position:0%
um uh threshold was uh was designed to
 
01:52:43.970 --> 01:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
be for the for the EFA program and uh
 
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
and again I'm I'm not I'm I'm not the
 
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't touch the 300 and and
 
01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:53.820 align:start position:0%
it would also presume and I think we've
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this before that you
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
know with a thousand bills going through
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
the um uh the House and Senate you know
 
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
some of them passed
 
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
um you know it's very it's possible that
 
01:53:08.689 --> 01:53:08.699 align:start position:0%
a bill like this could pass and a bill
 
01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
raising the income threshold to 350
 
01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
percent would pass and legislative
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
Services would put those two bills
 
01:53:18.109 --> 01:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
together and say okay annual income
 
01:53:21.410 --> 01:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
certification to 350 percent so this
 
01:53:23.689 --> 01:53:23.699 align:start position:0%
bill isn't touching the the percentage
 
01:53:26.689 --> 01:53:26.699 align:start position:0%
part but uh but you know but obviously
 
01:53:29.689 --> 01:53:29.699 align:start position:0%
legislative services and and Drafting
 
01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
and putting the other final statutory
 
01:53:34.189 --> 01:53:34.199 align:start position:0%
changes would uh would have to consider
 
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
all the bills that passed follow-up
 
01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:37.910 align:start position:0%
all the bills that passed follow-up
question

01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
um now I want to just just take a moment
 
01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
to explain to the committee here
 
01:53:44.810 --> 01:53:44.820 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to get through all
 
01:53:46.609 --> 01:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
these bills today if we do not get
 
01:53:48.169 --> 01:53:48.179 align:start position:0%
through these bills today we will be
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
meeting next week
 
01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:54.410 align:start position:0%
meeting next week
representative

01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:53:57.950 --> 01:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question I was just thinking
 
01:54:00.050 --> 01:54:00.060 align:start position:0%
about what you were saying as far as
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
um uh income going up by 200 50 it seems
 
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
like more often
 
01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
people get raises that are you know
 
01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
keeping up with inflation two percent
 
01:54:12.669 --> 01:54:12.679 align:start position:0%
five percent so do you have any
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
understanding of data or statistics as
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
to what percentage of students would no
 
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
longer qualify under efas that are
 
01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:24.290 align:start position:0%
longer qualify under efas that are
being

01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:54:26.270 --> 01:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
um taken out by only a few percent
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
versus how many are being taken out by
 
01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
large income gaps like 50 or 100 yeah so
 
01:54:35.330 --> 01:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
so you know at the at 300 percent that
 
01:54:38.570 --> 01:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
takes it right about to um uh actually
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
just a little bit over median household
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
income in New Statewide obviously you
 
01:54:47.689 --> 01:54:47.699 align:start position:0%
know that that uh changes significantly
 
01:54:51.290 --> 01:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
in from town to town and and north to
 
01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
south in the state but but Statewide
 
01:54:56.930 --> 01:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
it's about the median household uh
 
01:54:59.930 --> 01:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
median household income as that um as
 
01:55:02.209 --> 01:55:02.219 align:start position:0%
that as that increases you know I think
 
01:55:04.010 --> 01:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're there would
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
certainly be a um you know
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
students that uh that may be in families
 
01:55:13.609 --> 01:55:13.619 align:start position:0%
that uh from families that I mean if
 
01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
you're at 301 percent then uh then
 
01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
you're not you're obviously not going to
 
01:55:22.129 --> 01:55:22.139 align:start position:0%
be be income eligible but um but again
 
01:55:24.970 --> 01:55:24.980 align:start position:0%
the these um these these income
 
01:55:29.689 --> 01:55:29.699 align:start position:0%
guidelines uh do uh do I get adjusted
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
every year I believe every year
 
01:55:35.689 --> 01:55:35.699 align:start position:0%
um to uh and and and that would that
 
01:55:37.490 --> 01:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
would increase that would increase it
 
01:55:40.970 --> 01:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
for FY 23 and I I think the year starts
 
01:55:42.649 --> 01:55:42.659 align:start position:0%
in February or something like that so
 
01:55:44.689 --> 01:55:44.699 align:start position:0%
it's right around now that the new
 
01:55:47.330 --> 01:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
levels come in and uh and I think for
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
the first time in this program we're
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
finally seeing levels that uh don't have
 
01:55:54.350 --> 01:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
to have lots of commas and and numbers
 
01:55:57.010 --> 01:55:57.020 align:start position:0%
after that so 300 percent you're talking
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
90 350 105
 
01:56:04.609 --> 01:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
000 and 500 is 150 000. so uh so every
 
01:56:08.450 --> 01:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
um every uh a hundred percent of um of
 
01:56:12.770 --> 01:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
the poverty level is uh for FY 23s is
 
01:56:15.050 --> 01:56:15.060 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand dollars so that so
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
obviously the the EFA program is three
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
times that at ninety thousand what are
 
01:56:21.890 --> 01:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much terrific thank you
 
01:56:25.609 --> 01:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair
 
01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
I don't have any other pink cards for
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
this particular bill
 
01:56:32.689 --> 01:56:32.699 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to close this hearing
 
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
and we'll get ready to go
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%

Patty Cornell I represent District 22
 
01:57:26.750 --> 01:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
Ward 11 I'm Manchester's west side west
 
01:57:30.770 --> 01:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
side I am introducing House Bill 446 an
 
01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
act relative to the participation in the
 
01:57:35.570 --> 01:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts program by
 
01:57:37.970 --> 01:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities and I have an
 
01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
amendment that I'd also like to
 
01:57:40.970 --> 01:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
introduce that replaces a bill which
 
01:57:44.890 --> 01:57:44.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:48.530 --> 01:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
2023-0216h the intent of this bill is to
 
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
be a safeguard for parents and children
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
and to ensure that parents who
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
parentally place their children with a
 
01:57:58.189 --> 01:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
disability in a for-profit private
 
01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
school are not included in the
 
01:58:02.930 --> 01:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
definition of parentally placed private
 
01:58:06.589 --> 01:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
school children with with disabilities
 
01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
parents should be adequately informed
 
01:58:12.290 --> 01:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
and revised receive advanced notice of a
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
potential consequence and I'm not saying
 
01:58:16.430 --> 01:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
that they aren't and that somebody
 
01:58:19.310 --> 01:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
during the application process might say
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
something to them I just think it would
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
be better for parents and their students
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
that it'd be something in writing that
 
01:58:30.950 --> 01:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
they are handed and are aware of
 
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
according to the education Freedom
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
account vendor spending report dated
 
01:58:40.750 --> 01:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
June 30th 2022 there are at least seven
 
01:58:43.490 --> 01:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
for-profit schools where the accounts
 
01:58:47.570 --> 01:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
are used and where 75 students attend
 
01:58:50.290 --> 01:58:50.300 align:start position:0%
some of those schools are actin Academy
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
Lupine Montessori median house
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
Montessori Bedford Academy and a few
 
01:58:58.490 --> 01:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
more I do not know of students with
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
disabilities attend those schools but
 
01:59:03.169 --> 01:59:03.179 align:start position:0%
they could and if they are they're not
 
01:59:05.870 --> 01:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
entitled to the special education
 
01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
so in summary this bill is just intended
 
01:59:11.330 --> 01:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
to make parents informed before making a
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you questions from the
 
01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:20.149 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you questions from the
committee

01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:22.189 --> 01:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
I have one
 
01:59:22.199 --> 01:59:22.910 align:start position:0%
I have one
um

01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:25.550 --> 01:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:59:28.870 --> 01:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
the parentally placed student
 
01:59:32.209 --> 01:59:32.219 align:start position:0%
in a private school
 
01:59:32.219 --> 01:59:32.930 align:start position:0%
in a private school
um

01:59:32.930 --> 01:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
they do have
 
01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh certain rights under idea I think as
 
01:59:42.050 --> 01:59:42.060 align:start position:0%
you defined in the um in the USC code
 
01:59:45.470 --> 01:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
here is it am I correct I I may I maybe
 
01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
maybe misunderstood what you were saying
 
01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:48.709 align:start position:0%
maybe misunderstood what you were saying
earlier

01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:59:50.990 --> 01:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
this isn't all private schools this is
 
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
for-profit private schools
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
which I believe are not covered under
 
01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:56.870 align:start position:0%
which I believe are not covered under
this

01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:59:58.729 --> 01:59:58.739 align:start position:0%
and I think there are speakers that are
 
02:00:00.770 --> 02:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak after me that could
 
02:00:03.169 --> 02:00:03.179 align:start position:0%
explain to those rules better than I do
 
02:00:05.870 --> 02:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
than I can
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
so I might defer to them okay thank you
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
yes representative luno thank you very
 
02:00:15.530 --> 02:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair thank you very much
 
02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell bringing this in
 
02:00:20.689 --> 02:00:20.699 align:start position:0%
so um your your would it would it be
 
02:00:23.330 --> 02:00:23.340 align:start position:0%
clear that your intent here isn't to
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
deprive students rights that they're
 
02:00:29.209 --> 02:00:29.219 align:start position:0%
entitled to but clarify what what um
 
02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
what they're what their rights are uh in
 
02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
the situations they may PR that may
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
present through in the EFA program thank
 
02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative luno that is
 
02:00:42.350 --> 02:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
correct and as we heard the governor and
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
his um budget address to the education
 
02:00:48.050 --> 02:00:48.060 align:start position:0%
finance committee last week he's not
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
opposed to safeguards for the efas and I
 
02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
think this is a safeguard for parents
 
02:00:56.510 --> 02:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
and children with disabilities if they
 
02:00:59.209 --> 02:00:59.219 align:start position:0%
attend these schools
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you see no further questions thank
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you
 
02:01:07.609 --> 02:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
next we have Vanessa Blaise
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire Council on
 
02:01:12.350 --> 02:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities
 
02:01:19.209 --> 02:01:19.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee I'll
 
02:01:23.990 --> 02:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
be very brief my name is Vanessa Blaise
 
02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
I serve as the Director of policy and
 
02:01:27.530 --> 02:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
planning for the New Hampshire Council
 
02:01:29.930 --> 02:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
on developmental disabilities
 
02:01:31.850 --> 02:01:31.860 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here um because the council
 
02:01:34.810 --> 02:01:34.820 align:start position:0%
supports uh HB 446
 
02:01:38.450 --> 02:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
we feel that this bill merely requires
 
02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
informing parents of students acts who
 
02:01:43.850 --> 02:01:43.860 align:start position:0%
access Support Services in school what
 
02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
their rights are
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
um we're not asking anyone to change
 
02:01:50.750 --> 02:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
those rights or to make determinations
 
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
about what kinds of services private
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
for-profit schools are providing but
 
02:01:58.870 --> 02:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
making it so that parents understand
 
02:02:03.470 --> 02:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
what they are um they have the rights to
 
02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:04.310 align:start position:0%
what they are um they have the rights to
um

02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
if the purpose of the EFA is for parents
 
02:02:09.770 --> 02:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
to have more control over their students
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
education then we think that it is very
 
02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
important that they understand what
 
02:02:19.010 --> 02:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
their students rights are under the
 
02:02:21.470 --> 02:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines there's a lot of
 
02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
confusion as to what is a public school
 
02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
a non-public school a charter school a
 
02:02:30.169 --> 02:02:30.179 align:start position:0%
private for-profit school and we think
 
02:02:31.790 --> 02:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
that for parents to be able to make the
 
02:02:33.709 --> 02:02:33.719 align:start position:0%
best decision about their children's
 
02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
education that we should be providing
 
02:02:38.270 --> 02:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
them all of the information that they
 
02:02:42.729 --> 02:02:42.739 align:start position:0%
need in the letter that I had handed out
 
02:02:46.689 --> 02:02:46.699 align:start position:0%
is attached a very simple table
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
that briefly it is not in depth but
 
02:02:52.609 --> 02:02:52.619 align:start position:0%
briefly explains what students rights
 
02:02:55.310 --> 02:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
are under idea
 
02:02:58.030 --> 02:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to a for-profit versus
 
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
non-profit schools
 
02:03:02.510 --> 02:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
um so again we are in support of the
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
spell we feel that it's merely a
 
02:03:06.530 --> 02:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
um to be sure that parents are able to
 
02:03:09.890 --> 02:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
make the best decisions that they can
 
02:03:12.410 --> 02:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
when they're using the EFA program thank
 
02:03:12.420 --> 02:03:13.930 align:start position:0%
when they're using the EFA program thank
you

02:03:13.930 --> 02:03:13.940 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:15.709 align:start position:0%
you
questions

02:03:15.709 --> 02:03:15.719 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh I have one
 
02:03:21.169 --> 02:03:21.179 align:start position:0%
um the distinction you're making for uh
 
02:03:24.109 --> 02:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
for-profit versus non-profit private
 
02:03:27.530 --> 02:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
schools that is covered in section 1412
 
02:03:32.030 --> 02:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
as specified in the bill
 
02:03:33.530 --> 02:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I have to take a look at the
 
02:03:34.970 --> 02:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
belt sure
 
02:03:41.330 --> 02:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure if I understand what
 
02:03:45.550 --> 02:03:45.560 align:start position:0%
your what your question is I
 
02:03:48.109 --> 02:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
was uh actually I'll have an amendment
 
02:03:49.370 --> 02:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
coming also
 
02:03:52.250 --> 02:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
um so I have looked at section 1412 and
 
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
I don't remember seeing the distinction
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
between for-profit and non-profit in
 
02:03:59.810 --> 02:03:59.820 align:start position:0%
there and I'm just wondering where that
 
02:04:03.290 --> 02:04:03.300 align:start position:0%
distinction is in law well in in the
 
02:04:05.709 --> 02:04:05.719 align:start position:0%
distinction in law would be that a
 
02:04:08.810 --> 02:04:08.820 align:start position:0%
for-profit school is a for-profit
 
02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:09.709 align:start position:0%
for-profit school is a for-profit
business

02:04:09.709 --> 02:04:09.719 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:04:14.109 --> 02:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
and it is not a um some some
 
02:04:16.970 --> 02:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
non-profit schools are associated with
 
02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
public education through the public
 
02:04:20.930 --> 02:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
education system some are not
 
02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
but a private for-profit school is
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:30.770 --> 02:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much for being
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
here thank you
 
02:05:21.490 --> 02:05:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:24.410 --> 02:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Bonnie Dunham and
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
I'm here as a private citizen as a
 
02:05:26.159 --> 02:05:27.050 align:start position:0%
I'm here as a private citizen as a
parent

02:05:27.050 --> 02:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
parent
 
02:05:29.570 --> 02:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
um and regardless of how I might feel
 
02:05:32.089 --> 02:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
about education Freedom accounts I think
 
02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's very important that parents
 
02:05:36.350 --> 02:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
receive all of the information they need
 
02:05:37.850 --> 02:05:37.860 align:start position:0%
to make an informed decision about
 
02:05:40.129 --> 02:05:40.139 align:start position:0%
whether they choose to participate in
 
02:05:42.890 --> 02:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
that program which is the intent of this
 
02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
bill so thank you for that I have two
 
02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
concerns though both of which I believe
 
02:05:48.530 --> 02:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
are addressed in the amendment the first
 
02:05:50.810 --> 02:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
is on the statement that participation
 
02:05:52.850 --> 02:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
in the EFA program is the parental
 
02:05:56.810 --> 02:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
placement under 20 USC 1412 a10a doesn't
 
02:05:58.669 --> 02:05:58.679 align:start position:0%
specify that it only applies to a
 
02:06:00.109 --> 02:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
parental placement in a school or
 
02:06:02.689 --> 02:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
facility that meets the definition of an
 
02:06:05.089 --> 02:06:05.099 align:start position:0%
elementary or secondary school it does
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
not include children who are
 
02:06:08.030 --> 02:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
homeschooled or who are placed in a
 
02:06:10.930 --> 02:06:10.940 align:start position:0%
for-profit private school using an EFA
 
02:06:13.729 --> 02:06:13.739 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is while 1412
 
02:06:15.890 --> 02:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify that exactly it says
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities in the state
 
02:06:19.729 --> 02:06:19.739 align:start position:0%
who are enrolled by their parents in
 
02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
private elementary schools and secondary
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
schools and the definition of an
 
02:06:25.850 --> 02:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
elementary and secondary school in the
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
IDS statute regulations and in the
 
02:06:30.830 --> 02:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
elementary and secondary Education Act
 
02:06:33.229 --> 02:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
specify that those are non-profit
 
02:06:36.410 --> 02:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
institutional day or residential schools
 
02:06:38.810 --> 02:06:38.820 align:start position:0%
and so that's where that comes from and
 
02:06:40.970 --> 02:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
that's further emphasized in a letter
 
02:06:42.530 --> 02:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
from the office of special education
 
02:06:44.689 --> 02:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
programs to Chapman who asked that
 
02:06:47.990 --> 02:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
question way back in 2007 although not
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
specifically about education Freedom
 
02:06:52.189 --> 02:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
accounts and then the U.S the New
 
02:06:54.350 --> 02:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education issued
 
02:06:57.649 --> 02:06:57.659 align:start position:0%
a memo in 2010 memo number 38 to address
 
02:07:00.290 --> 02:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
that same question and that also says
 
02:07:02.450 --> 02:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
only non-profit public schools that are
 
02:07:03.770 --> 02:07:03.780 align:start position:0%

02:07:06.050 --> 02:07:06.060 align:start position:0%

02:07:09.669 --> 02:07:09.679 align:start position:0%
school requirement for idea
 
02:07:12.169 --> 02:07:12.179 align:start position:0%
so if a parent enrolls their child with
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
a disability in an EFA using an EFA in a
 
02:07:17.570 --> 02:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
public or private non-profit Elementary
 
02:07:20.930 --> 02:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
or secondary school then that means that
 
02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
the child is considered to be apparently
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%

while the child no longer has an

that child would receive if enrolled in
 
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
a public school they may receive some

provision of idea
 
02:07:44.149 --> 02:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
if on the other hand the child is
 
02:07:46.189 --> 02:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
enrolled by their parent in a for-profit
 
02:07:48.350 --> 02:07:48.360 align:start position:0%

elementary or secondary school the child
 
02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
would not be considered to be a

parentally placed child with a

any special education or related
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
Services Under the idea the Equitable
 
02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:03.719 align:start position:0%
Services requirement provides that the
 
02:08:06.410 --> 02:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
Lea School District must spend an amount
 
02:08:08.750 --> 02:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
proportionate to the amount of idea
 
02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:10.440 align:start position:0%

02:08:16.129 --> 02:08:16.139 align:start position:0%
private elementary or secondary schools
 
02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
in the school district served by the Lea
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
children who are not enrolled in in
 
02:08:22.370 --> 02:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
those schools children who are enrolled
 
02:08:24.890 --> 02:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
in for-profit private schools or who are
 
02:08:27.410 --> 02:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
homeschooled do not receive any idea
 
02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
funds Ida does not provide school
 
02:08:31.129 --> 02:08:31.139 align:start position:0%
districts any funds for children in
 
02:08:33.050 --> 02:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
for-profit private schools or who are
 
02:08:35.649 --> 02:08:35.659 align:start position:0%
homeschooled so the Equitable
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
education or the pro-rada share doesn't
 
02:08:42.169 --> 02:08:42.179 align:start position:0%
apply it's just not not equivalent
 
02:08:42.179 --> 02:08:43.189 align:start position:0%
apply it's just not not equivalent
um

02:08:43.189 --> 02:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
School District though how Woods
 
02:08:47.209 --> 02:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
continue to be responsible justice for
 
02:08:49.850 --> 02:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
all children for child find activities
 
02:08:51.709 --> 02:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
meaning evaluating a child who they
 
02:08:53.530 --> 02:08:53.540 align:start position:0%
suspect to have a disability
 
02:08:56.810 --> 02:08:56.820 align:start position:0%
and reevaluating at least once every
 
02:08:58.430 --> 02:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
three years to determine if the child
 
02:09:00.470 --> 02:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
continues to that again allows the
 
02:09:02.530 --> 02:09:02.540 align:start position:0%
parent to make an informed decision
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
and that's not paid forth through idea
 
02:09:07.250 --> 02:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
funds that's generally paid for through
 
02:09:10.370 --> 02:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
local tax dollars my second concern is
 
02:09:13.550 --> 02:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
that the language in in the um
 
02:09:17.050 --> 02:09:17.060 align:start position:0%
in the current bill does not
 
02:09:22.689 --> 02:09:22.699 align:start position:0%
specify that what it says in 34 CFR
 
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
300.137 and the idea regulations no
 
02:09:27.770 --> 02:09:27.780 align:start position:0%
parentally placed private school child
 
02:09:29.930 --> 02:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
with a disability has an individual
 
02:09:31.790 --> 02:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
right to receive some or all of the
 
02:09:34.070 --> 02:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
special education services that the
 
02:09:35.810 --> 02:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
child would receive if enrolled in a
 
02:09:37.550 --> 02:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
public school and then they go into the
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
whole formula and process for
 
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
determining how to provide Equitable
 
02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:43.330 align:start position:0%
determining how to provide Equitable
Services

02:09:43.330 --> 02:09:43.340 align:start position:0%
Services
 
02:09:47.229 --> 02:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
and while that's not in the statute the
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
comments in the Ida regulation state
 
02:09:51.770 --> 02:09:51.780 align:start position:0%
that it reflects the Department's
 
02:09:54.410 --> 02:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
long-standing policy consistent with the
 
02:09:56.390 --> 02:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
act and explicitly provides that
 
02:09:58.070 --> 02:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities enrolled in
 
02:10:00.169 --> 02:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
private schools by their parents have no
 
02:10:01.870 --> 02:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
individual entitlement
 
02:10:04.669 --> 02:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
under the Act leas only have an

private school children with
 
02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities an opportunity for
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
Equitable participation in the services
 
02:10:14.270 --> 02:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
funded with Federal Part B funds that
 
02:10:16.490 --> 02:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
the lease Lea has determined after
 
02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
meaningful And Timely consultation with
 
02:10:21.050 --> 02:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
private schools to make available to the
 
02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:23.520 align:start position:0%

02:10:26.689 --> 02:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
are not required to spend more than
 
02:10:28.310 --> 02:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
their proportionate Federal share on
 
02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
those services
 
02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:31.129 align:start position:0%
those services
um

02:10:31.129 --> 02:10:31.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:33.290 --> 02:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
I ask that you please add language to
 
02:10:36.350 --> 02:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
make clear both of those points and I
 
02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
believe the amendment does that by
 
02:10:41.089 --> 02:10:41.099 align:start position:0%
including a reference to 34 CFR Point
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
137 and stating that the scholarship
 
02:10:46.790 --> 02:10:46.800 align:start position:0%

02:10:48.350 --> 02:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
provided to parents of children with

disabilities who are considering an EFA
 
02:10:53.629 --> 02:10:53.639 align:start position:0%
specify that a parental placement under
 
02:10:56.570 --> 02:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
idea means a parental placement by a
 
02:10:58.430 --> 02:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
parent in a school or facility that
 
02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
meets the definition of an elementary or
 
02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:03.360 align:start position:0%

the Chairman's uh Lads briefing I will
 
02:32:08.870 --> 02:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
keep this brief and limit my responses
 
02:32:12.349 --> 02:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
um that that being said this is a bill
 
02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
that tries to once again put a few God
 
02:32:19.370 --> 02:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
rails into the EFA pieces and I'm sure
 
02:32:21.410 --> 02:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
that you're following on along with me
 
02:32:25.809 --> 02:32:25.819 align:start position:0%
uh specifically uh under a couple of uh
 
02:32:28.730 --> 02:32:28.740 align:start position:0%
Clarity pieces for the education and
 
02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
service provider uh the first one under
 
02:32:34.610 --> 02:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
a is the idea that the provider needs
 
02:32:36.590 --> 02:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
his business or their business or their
 
02:32:38.090 --> 02:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
school or whatever whatever program
 
02:32:40.070 --> 02:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
they're using the needs to be in
 
02:32:42.770 --> 02:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
operation for a year and representative
 
02:32:44.570 --> 02:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
is concerned about the financial
 
02:32:46.610 --> 02:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
stability of a program site and then
 
02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
falling off the second one and and I
 
02:32:52.070 --> 02:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
would make note that this talks about
 
02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
providing instruction to students in a
 
02:32:58.250 --> 02:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
public non-public school uh the chorus
 
02:33:02.570 --> 02:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
lawn and align with Ed 400 there was
 
02:33:03.530 --> 02:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
some question about that it
 
02:33:05.090 --> 02:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas may have a question
 
02:33:08.450 --> 02:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
and and has some valid points on that uh
 
02:33:10.670 --> 02:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
moving forward the other couple pieces
 
02:33:13.790 --> 02:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
is a concern when students go to some of
 
02:33:15.710 --> 02:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
these providers that perhaps the
 
02:33:18.590 --> 02:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
location may not be as safe and not any
 
02:33:20.210 --> 02:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
safety standards that they typically
 
02:33:23.210 --> 02:33:23.220 align:start position:0%
would uh for students particularly in
 
02:33:26.570 --> 02:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
the uh mechanical areas and then finally
 
02:33:28.910 --> 02:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
the last one is is critically important
 
02:33:31.790 --> 02:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
and that is the continued request for a
 
02:33:34.190 --> 02:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
criminal background check for uh
 
02:33:35.870 --> 02:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
providers that are working with students
 
02:33:38.030 --> 02:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
uh as it would be in public school
 
02:33:39.290 --> 02:33:39.300 align:start position:0%
anyone that's dealing with direct
 
02:33:42.290 --> 02:33:42.300 align:start position:0%
instruction so that's the Four Points of
 
02:33:44.150 --> 02:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
Representative Tana's bill I appreciate
 
02:33:46.130 --> 02:33:46.140 align:start position:0%
the fact that I'm a co-sponsor but I
 
02:33:47.450 --> 02:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
will tell you candidly she knows a lot
 
02:33:49.429 --> 02:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
more about this than I do and I'll be
 
02:33:51.730 --> 02:33:51.740 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions I can answer
 
02:33:55.610 --> 02:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
which would be a very brief number
 
02:33:56.990 --> 02:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:34:01.010 --> 02:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:02.450 --> 02:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:34:02.460 --> 02:34:03.950 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:34:03.950 --> 02:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:06.170 --> 02:34:06.180 align:start position:0%
so I'm just wondering
 
02:34:08.650 --> 02:34:08.660 align:start position:0%
as you know how
 
02:34:12.050 --> 02:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
this would apply this section B if
 
02:34:14.570 --> 02:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
providing instruction to students
 
02:34:16.910 --> 02:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
it needs to be an approved non-public
 
02:34:19.429 --> 02:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
school education program pursuant to
 
02:34:21.170 --> 02:34:21.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Education blah blah blah
 
02:34:24.110 --> 02:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
so the question is what about Stu tutors
 
02:34:26.150 --> 02:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
what about
 
02:34:28.550 --> 02:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
um music instruct you know
 
02:34:30.889 --> 02:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
music instruction that type of thing
 
02:34:32.750 --> 02:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
they are not schools they are
 
02:34:34.969 --> 02:34:34.979 align:start position:0%
individuals right and and uh I
 
02:34:36.650 --> 02:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question the Robinson
 
02:34:38.990 --> 02:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
lake is particularly uh to the knowledge
 
02:34:42.410 --> 02:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
you made that prior uh concern uh last
 
02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
year when a civil bill came forward and
 
02:34:45.950 --> 02:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
I think you're right I think there this
 
02:34:47.570 --> 02:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
02:34:49.670 --> 02:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
um and perhaps represent cordelli does I
 
02:34:51.590 --> 02:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if rule had 40 had a further
 
02:34:53.809 --> 02:34:53.819 align:start position:0%
definition of whether it is but I would
 
02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
be uh happy to uh talk with
 
02:34:57.710 --> 02:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
representative which comes back and and
 
02:35:00.650 --> 02:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
amend that to take your concern into the
 
02:35:01.969 --> 02:35:01.979 align:start position:0%
question I think you have a valid point
 
02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know Canley is the new e400 uh
 
02:35:07.370 --> 02:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
rules have that enough but but you make
 
02:35:10.370 --> 02:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
a valid point thank you very much
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Belcher
 
02:35:14.929 --> 02:35:14.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:35:19.610 --> 02:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
um as you know efas have been
 
02:35:21.110 --> 02:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
um quite popular perhaps more popular
 
02:35:23.630 --> 02:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
than was originally expected a large
 
02:35:25.370 --> 02:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
number of students have registered for
 
02:35:30.050 --> 02:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
them so I'm looking at item uh 2A if new
 
02:35:31.969 --> 02:35:31.979 align:start position:0%
providers wanted to enter the
 
02:35:34.309 --> 02:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
marketplace to meet this increased
 
02:35:37.070 --> 02:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
Demand with item a prohibit them from
 
02:35:38.750 --> 02:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
being able to do so because they're not
 
02:35:41.030 --> 02:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
in operation for your
 
02:35:42.469 --> 02:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Reverend
 
02:35:44.690 --> 02:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
velker uh my thinking is your answer
 
02:35:46.730 --> 02:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
would be yes it would preclude them from
 
02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
being participatory uh for the first
 
02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
year this the intent of the a is to make
 
02:35:53.270 --> 02:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
sure that the organization that's
 
02:35:55.010 --> 02:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
working with the students has Financial
 
02:35:56.990 --> 02:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
capabilities to last for the year so the
 
02:35:58.429 --> 02:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
youngster to start a program that it
 
02:36:00.710 --> 02:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
goes belly up I mean most most of the
 
02:36:02.210 --> 02:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
providers that you'll see I'm sure that
 
02:36:04.670 --> 02:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
others here who are into the EFA program
 
02:36:06.050 --> 02:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
when they when you look at a list of
 
02:36:08.809 --> 02:36:08.819 align:start position:0%
providers have been around a while
 
02:36:12.910 --> 02:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:16.130 --> 02:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
any further questions see none thank you
 
02:36:19.070 --> 02:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
very much thank you Mr appreciate it
 
02:36:21.950 --> 02:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
and we have uh
 
02:36:31.309 --> 02:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:33.650 --> 02:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair members of the
 
02:36:35.330 --> 02:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
committee for the opportunity to provide
 
02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
testimony today uh my name is Sarah
 
02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
Scott and I'm the director of Grassroots
 
02:36:41.570 --> 02:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
operations with Americans for Prosperity
 
02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and on behalf of
 
02:36:45.410 --> 02:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
Americans for Prosperity New Hampshire
 
02:36:47.809 --> 02:36:47.819 align:start position:0%
and our activists across the state we'd
 
02:36:50.330 --> 02:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
ask that you oppose this bill I'll keep
 
02:36:52.010 --> 02:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
this pretty brief I just wanted to go
 
02:36:54.830 --> 02:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
over a couple of the highlights here so
 
02:36:57.530 --> 02:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
primarily the requirement that these
 
02:36:59.450 --> 02:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
service providers be in operation for a
 
02:37:01.550 --> 02:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
minimum of one year I think this really
 
02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
restricts Us in terms of innovation as
 
02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
well as opportunity for new service
 
02:37:08.809 --> 02:37:08.819 align:start position:0%
providers to enter the market we're
 
02:37:10.670 --> 02:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
seeing education changing at such a
 
02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
rapid rate that we could be missing out
 
02:37:14.929 --> 02:37:14.939 align:start position:0%
on lots of innovative programs by
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
requiring them to be in operation for a
 
02:37:20.150 --> 02:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
year we're also restricting teachers
 
02:37:22.130 --> 02:37:22.140 align:start position:0%
abilities to become tutors for this
 
02:37:25.550 --> 02:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
program so if the teacher decided that
 
02:37:27.650 --> 02:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
they wanted to do this on the side or
 
02:37:29.450 --> 02:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
they wanted to exit the traditional
 
02:37:31.490 --> 02:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
public school system and become a tutor
 
02:37:33.650 --> 02:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
uh this bill would say that they can't
 
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
become a tutor for the EFA program
 
02:37:37.130 --> 02:37:37.140 align:start position:0%
unless they've been in operation for a
 
02:37:39.530 --> 02:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
year so I think placing an arbitrary
 
02:37:42.290 --> 02:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
limit by saying that even if you've been
 
02:37:43.849 --> 02:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
teaching in the school system for 25
 
02:37:46.370 --> 02:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
years you have to be in operation as an
 
02:37:48.530 --> 02:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
EFA provider for a year before you can
 
02:37:50.510 --> 02:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
get that funds
 
02:37:52.309 --> 02:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
um is really limiting who we can take
 
02:37:53.750 --> 02:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
advantage of in terms of Education
 
02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:55.370 align:start position:0%
advantage of in terms of Education
providers

02:37:55.370 --> 02:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
providers
 
02:37:55.380 --> 02:37:56.270 align:start position:0%
providers
um

02:37:56.270 --> 02:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:58.010 --> 02:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
also that it seems like the points have
 
02:38:00.290 --> 02:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
already been addressed about uh the
 
02:38:03.290 --> 02:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
approved Public School A lot of these
 
02:38:05.870 --> 02:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
organizations are not schools they are
 
02:38:08.870 --> 02:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
organizations or they're sports teams or
 
02:38:11.450 --> 02:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
they are otherwise outside of the
 
02:38:13.550 --> 02:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
non-public school system but sounds like
 
02:38:14.929 --> 02:38:14.939 align:start position:0%
those issues have already been addressed
 
02:38:17.570 --> 02:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
so primarily my opposition is about that
 
02:38:19.790 --> 02:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
minimum of one year
 
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
um so uh with that I'll just conclude
 
02:38:23.870 --> 02:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
and happy to take any questions
 
02:38:25.250 --> 02:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:38:28.130 --> 02:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
any questions for Miss Scott
 
02:38:32.150 --> 02:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
see none get off very easy today thank
 
02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:35.630 align:start position:0%
see none get off very easy today thank
you

02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:38.510 --> 02:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
I do not believe we have any further
 
02:38:41.690 --> 02:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
cards if there's no one else interested
 
02:38:44.030 --> 02:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
in testifying
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
I'll close the hearing on House Bill 603
 
02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:48.590 align:start position:0%

wasn't supposed to come back to my seat

question of Miss Dunham and I'm not
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to do that so I completely

education Freedom account program so
 
04:05:25.990 --> 04:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
um so HP 573 actually uh came
 
04:05:29.450 --> 04:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
uh came out of drafting
 
04:05:29.460 --> 04:05:30.229 align:start position:0%
uh came out of drafting
um

04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:33.110 --> 04:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
um and and with no and I don't mean
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
anything negative against our very very
 
04:05:39.670 --> 04:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
hard working and uh and skilled
 
04:05:42.229 --> 04:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
legislative service drafting uh
 
04:05:45.769 --> 04:05:45.779 align:start position:0%
attorneys but um it was signed off I
 
04:05:48.110 --> 04:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
signed off on it pending um pending
 
04:05:48.120 --> 04:05:48.889 align:start position:0%
signed off on it pending um pending
final

04:05:48.889 --> 04:05:48.899 align:start position:0%
final
 
04:05:51.710 --> 04:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
um uh final Drafting and so it did it
 
04:05:53.870 --> 04:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
did come at us with uh with an error
 
04:05:56.689 --> 04:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
that'll that'll get um I'll get to in a
 
04:06:00.710 --> 04:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
moment but excuse me the uh the emphasis
 
04:06:05.650 --> 04:06:05.660 align:start position:0%
on um on 573 is uh is basically to
 
04:06:10.250 --> 04:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
provide some uh some accountability uh
 
04:06:13.429 --> 04:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
and uh and transparency when the state
 
04:06:16.070 --> 04:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
budgets for um
 
04:06:19.189 --> 04:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
for Education Freedom accounts and two
 
04:06:23.030 --> 04:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
years ago at this time the Department of
 
04:06:25.910 --> 04:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
Education Department of Education had
 
04:06:28.790 --> 04:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
had indicated during the I think it was
 
04:06:31.790 --> 04:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
during the Senate uh process of of
 
04:06:34.729 --> 04:06:34.739 align:start position:0%
budget development that education
 
04:06:36.290 --> 04:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts were going to cost
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
somewhere on the neighborhood of a
 
04:06:40.490 --> 04:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
hundred and thirty thousand dollars in
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
the first year and three million dollars
 
04:06:44.269 --> 04:06:44.279 align:start position:0%
in the second year and I think as we all
 
04:06:48.170 --> 04:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
know uh uh over that period of time it's
 
04:06:51.110 --> 04:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh come in uh closer to 25 million
 
04:06:54.590 --> 04:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
dollars and uh we were we were warned
 
04:06:57.170 --> 04:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
the legislature was warned during the
 
04:07:01.070 --> 04:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
budget process last year by um by the uh
 
04:07:03.790 --> 04:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
office of legislative budget assistant
 
04:07:07.189 --> 04:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
that that it could
 
04:07:11.330 --> 04:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh that the state could face obligations
 
04:07:14.269 --> 04:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
uh under the program closing in on 70
 
04:07:18.590 --> 04:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars so uh uh so while it uh
 
04:07:20.570 --> 04:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
while it wasn't 70 million well it
 
04:07:22.070 --> 04:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
didn't turn out to be a 70 million
 
04:07:24.410 --> 04:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
dollar exposure it did come out to be
 
04:07:26.450 --> 04:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
close to a 25 million dollar exposure
 
04:07:29.210 --> 04:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
which is a lot more than what the
 
04:07:32.389 --> 04:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Education had uh um had
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
had let on and um and so this um this is
 
04:07:39.410 --> 04:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
pretty simple it um
 
04:07:43.010 --> 04:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
it just holds the uh the program
 
04:07:45.710 --> 04:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
um to the to the bud to not to exceed
 
04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
the budgeted months and uh and you know
 
04:07:52.370 --> 04:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
we do that and every um every aspect of
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
our um of our budgeting process we know
 
04:07:58.309 --> 04:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
how many kids go to uh go to public
 
04:08:01.189 --> 04:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
schools in the year before that gets
 
04:08:04.010 --> 04:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
budgeted in the in the first year of the
 
04:08:05.450 --> 04:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
budget and carried through into the
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
second year of the budget the um uh
 
04:08:12.290 --> 04:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
in other departments outside of
 
04:08:14.450 --> 04:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
Education Commissioners and department
 
04:08:16.729 --> 04:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
heads and program heads have to talk
 
04:08:18.590 --> 04:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
about what their department needs are
 
04:08:21.290 --> 04:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
and and those numbers get get put into
 
04:08:24.290 --> 04:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
the budget the um the budget assistant
 
04:08:27.469 --> 04:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
said hey you know the education Freedom
 
04:08:29.450 --> 04:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
account is really a blank check and
 
04:08:31.670 --> 04:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
that's not something that we've done in
 
04:08:35.450 --> 04:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
any other program in the state so I'm
 
04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not doing it because I'm saying that
 
04:08:41.929 --> 04:08:41.939 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be spending um State
 
04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
dollars or taxpayer dollars on education
 
04:08:46.849 --> 04:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts I'm not doing it
 
04:08:46.859 --> 04:08:47.929 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts I'm not doing it
because

04:08:47.929 --> 04:08:47.939 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:08:49.490 --> 04:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
um because I don't think the state
 
04:08:51.349 --> 04:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
should pay for private school or home
 
04:08:55.849 --> 04:08:55.859 align:start position:0%
school tuition bills I'm doing it
 
04:08:59.030 --> 04:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
because taxpayer money is being used and
 
04:09:01.090 --> 04:09:01.100 align:start position:0%
it should be budgeted uh appropriately
 
04:09:04.370 --> 04:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
and and uh State officials need to be
 
04:09:07.070 --> 04:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
held accountable if their budgets are
 
04:09:09.530 --> 04:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
not even close as they haven't been in
 
04:09:11.510 --> 04:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
the first two years of this program to
 
04:09:14.750 --> 04:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
what was uh what was presented so
 
04:09:17.450 --> 04:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
so there's a couple other areas where
 
04:09:20.590 --> 04:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
where um where I think we've we've seen
 
04:09:24.010 --> 04:09:24.020 align:start position:0%
uh this type of um
 
04:09:26.689 --> 04:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
type of language or this type of
 
04:09:29.809 --> 04:09:29.819 align:start position:0%
budgeting process used when it comes to
 
04:09:32.750 --> 04:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh to education we do it in special
 
04:09:35.570 --> 04:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
education Aid
 
04:09:38.030 --> 04:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
the finance committee budgets during the
 
04:09:40.550 --> 04:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
budget process somewhere somewhere it's
 
04:09:43.250 --> 04:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
usually around 30 or 32 or 33 million
 
04:09:46.490 --> 04:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
dollars for special education aid and
 
04:09:49.130 --> 04:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
there's a provision in that statute that
 
04:09:51.410 --> 04:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
if those numbers are not satisfactory
 
04:09:53.809 --> 04:09:53.819 align:start position:0%
then every school district will get a
 
04:09:58.610 --> 04:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
prorated share of that so uh so if if 32
 
04:10:00.469 --> 04:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
million dollars if that was budgeted and
 
04:10:02.990 --> 04:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
that only paid for 75 percent of the
 
04:10:05.389 --> 04:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
True Value then then every every
 
04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
District would receive 75 percent of
 
04:10:10.189 --> 04:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
that budgeted amount I don't think it's
 
04:10:13.010 --> 04:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
ever been that drastically off budget
 
04:10:15.469 --> 04:10:15.479 align:start position:0%
but I think sometime in recent memory it
 
04:10:17.870 --> 04:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
has been 90 or 95 percent
 
04:10:20.990 --> 04:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
um uh prorated another example to use
 
04:10:24.469 --> 04:10:24.479 align:start position:0%
would be the education tax credit uh
 
04:10:26.929 --> 04:10:26.939 align:start position:0%
program which by Statute
 
04:10:29.450 --> 04:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
God which same as a budget
 
04:10:32.630 --> 04:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
um is is budgeted in this case at 5.1
 
04:10:36.110 --> 04:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars and um and uh I don't
 
04:10:38.990 --> 04:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
believe in the education tax uh credit
 
04:10:41.929 --> 04:10:41.939 align:start position:0%
program that that um that the
 
04:10:43.670 --> 04:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
participant that the number of
 
04:10:45.170 --> 04:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
participating students in the grants
 
04:10:47.689 --> 04:10:47.699 align:start position:0%
they received have um have have have
 
04:10:52.189 --> 04:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
come up against that um that cap and um
 
04:10:54.769 --> 04:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
uh honestly I'm not quite sure what
 
04:10:57.530 --> 04:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
would happen if they do come up to the
 
04:11:00.670 --> 04:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
cap but uh but we've certainly got got
 
04:11:03.710 --> 04:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
examples like in special education Aid
 
04:11:07.969 --> 04:11:07.979 align:start position:0%
where it was prorated and um and uh uh
 
04:11:09.950 --> 04:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
and I think another way to do it is you
 
04:11:12.530 --> 04:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
don't prorate it and you um you know you
 
04:11:15.830 --> 04:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
issue um uh the um the scholarships
 
04:11:18.950 --> 04:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
until the money runs out and uh and then
 
04:11:20.689 --> 04:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
you may be able to provide some sort of
 
04:11:23.210 --> 04:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
priority or or maybe more accurate
 
04:11:26.570 --> 04:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
budgeting in um in in future years but
 
04:11:28.250 --> 04:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh but it certainly puts some
 
04:11:31.910 --> 04:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
accountability on um on you know what uh
 
04:11:34.670 --> 04:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
what's being told during the during the
 
04:11:36.590 --> 04:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
budget process and some accountability
 
04:11:39.950 --> 04:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
on the department for that so um so just
 
04:11:41.630 --> 04:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
going going quickly
 
04:11:44.210 --> 04:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
um uh down the bill
 
04:11:47.450 --> 04:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh on page um on just the inside first
 
04:11:50.450 --> 04:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
page of the bill uh the amounts uh to
 
04:11:52.729 --> 04:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
fund the grants of transfers are hereby
 
04:11:55.490 --> 04:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
appropriated from the Department uh from
 
04:11:57.830 --> 04:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
from the from the education trust fund
 
04:12:01.189 --> 04:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
but then it um it it
 
04:12:05.389 --> 04:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
strikes a lot of the the language in
 
04:12:08.030 --> 04:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
there right now that doesn't have any
 
04:12:11.689 --> 04:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
accountability to budgeted amounts and
 
04:12:14.870 --> 04:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
um and and basically picks up
 
04:12:14.880 --> 04:12:16.070 align:start position:0%
um and and basically picks up
um

04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:19.790 --> 04:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
with I want to make sure such warrant
 
04:12:22.910 --> 04:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
for payment shall
 
04:12:25.370 --> 04:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
and and this is where the error is on
 
04:12:26.870 --> 04:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
line 12.
 
04:12:29.210 --> 04:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
um that first part on line 12 should not
 
04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
be in there that was left over from FY
 
04:12:36.050 --> 04:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
23 and it's not even not even meaningful
 
04:12:38.510 --> 04:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
for this but but it should pick up at
 
04:12:41.150 --> 04:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
the end of line 12 so such weren't for
 
04:12:43.250 --> 04:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
payment shall not exceed the amounts
 
04:12:45.710 --> 04:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
appropriated for such purpose in the
 
04:12:47.929 --> 04:12:47.939 align:start position:0%
biennial State operating budget and
 
04:12:50.210 --> 04:12:50.220 align:start position:0%
that's it it's just truth and budgeting
 
04:12:53.090 --> 04:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
and and hopefully this is something that
 
04:12:54.889 --> 04:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
that can be bipartisan that people
 
04:12:56.809 --> 04:12:56.819 align:start position:0%
understand because we do it all over
 
04:12:59.630 --> 04:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
state government your cities and towns
 
04:13:02.389 --> 04:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh do it that's what uh you know we're
 
04:13:04.670 --> 04:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
coming up in March for for many of our
 
04:13:06.710 --> 04:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
towns will hold School District meeting
 
04:13:08.689 --> 04:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
and their annual Town meetings and
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what we do uh uh during
 
04:13:14.450 --> 04:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
these meetings and if school boards
 
04:13:16.370 --> 04:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
present their budget select boards
 
04:13:18.889 --> 04:13:18.899 align:start position:0%
present their budget and they're held
 
04:13:21.349 --> 04:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
accountable to those uh to stay within
 
04:13:23.809 --> 04:13:23.819 align:start position:0%
those those budget it's during the
 
04:13:25.670 --> 04:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
ensuing year so
 
04:13:28.429 --> 04:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
so I'm not asking any more from from the
 
04:13:30.830 --> 04:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
state to be responsible with taxpayer
 
04:13:33.170 --> 04:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
dollars when uh when budgeting for
 
04:13:35.689 --> 04:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
Education Freedom accounts so that's uh
 
04:13:37.309 --> 04:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
what I've got here I'm happy to take a
 
04:13:39.349 --> 04:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
couple questions thank you very much are
 
04:13:41.030 --> 04:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee yes
 
04:13:41.040 --> 04:13:43.910 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee yes
representative

04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:47.030 --> 04:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
I'm curious how you came up with 25
 
04:13:49.849 --> 04:13:49.859 align:start position:0%
million dollars for this year
 
04:13:52.370 --> 04:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
so I just did a quick calculation and
 
04:13:54.290 --> 04:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
it's nowhere near that no I didn't say
 
04:13:56.090 --> 04:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
for the for this year for the first two
 
04:13:57.710 --> 04:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
years of the program I think it was
 
04:13:59.809 --> 04:13:59.819 align:start position:0%
something like training them yeah yeah I
 
04:14:01.910 --> 04:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what I said was for the first
 
04:14:04.849 --> 04:14:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:07.070 --> 04:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
04:14:08.929 --> 04:14:08.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:14:10.729 --> 04:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
04:14:13.729 --> 04:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
um you compared the possibility of
 
04:14:15.769 --> 04:14:15.779 align:start position:0%
prorating this program with the way that
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
we do special education funding when the
 
04:14:20.750 --> 04:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
amount runs out it's prorated
 
04:14:20.760 --> 04:14:21.710 align:start position:0%
amount runs out it's prorated
um

04:14:21.710 --> 04:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:23.330 --> 04:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
but when the amount Runs Out in special
 
04:14:26.570 --> 04:14:26.580 align:start position:0%
education versus this program
 
04:14:29.150 --> 04:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
um would parents have to pick up the
 
04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
cost in special education when it runs
 
04:14:33.290 --> 04:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
out because it seems like they would in
 
04:14:34.670 --> 04:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
this program
 
04:14:37.550 --> 04:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
no in in special education funding these
 
04:14:39.170 --> 04:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
are grants that go to school districts
 
04:14:41.870 --> 04:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
so parents do pick up the uh the tab
 
04:14:43.849 --> 04:14:43.859 align:start position:0%
through their their local education
 
04:14:47.030 --> 04:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
property tax absolutely do if I I think
 
04:14:49.910 --> 04:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
I misspelled a little bit uh I'm
 
04:14:51.710 --> 04:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
suggesting that when when the amount is
 
04:14:55.309 --> 04:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
run out and they have to prorate
 
04:14:55.319 --> 04:14:56.090 align:start position:0%
run out and they have to prorate
um

04:14:56.090 --> 04:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:58.250 --> 04:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
the amount that is received for special
 
04:14:58.260 --> 04:14:59.689 align:start position:0%
the amount that is received for special
education

04:14:59.689 --> 04:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:15:01.849 --> 04:15:01.859 align:start position:0%
anything over that amount that is not
 
04:15:04.429 --> 04:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
paid for by the state Grant is that
 
04:15:05.750 --> 04:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
amount coming directly out of the
 
04:15:07.309 --> 04:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
parents pockets of the special education
 
04:15:09.769 --> 04:15:09.779 align:start position:0%
child oh no no because that special
 
04:15:12.469 --> 04:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
education is absolutely something that
 
04:15:16.910 --> 04:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
that is is um uh you know directed to to
 
04:15:19.610 --> 04:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
the state by federal law and I'm really
 
04:15:23.450 --> 04:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
at the boundary of my my um you know uh
 
04:15:23.460 --> 04:15:24.830 align:start position:0%
at the boundary of my my um you know uh
conversion

04:15:24.830 --> 04:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
conversion
 
04:15:27.889 --> 04:15:27.899 align:start position:0%
um you know understanding of this but uh
 
04:15:30.769 --> 04:15:30.779 align:start position:0%
but not a dime of that comes out of um
 
04:15:33.530 --> 04:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
out of out of a parent's personal
 
04:15:36.170 --> 04:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
thank you wallet further questions from
 
04:15:39.769 --> 04:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
the committee represent cordelli
 
04:15:41.170 --> 04:15:41.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:15:44.330 --> 04:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
when the budget cap or the budgeted
 
04:15:47.450 --> 04:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
amount is reached what happens to other
 
04:15:50.990 --> 04:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
students who are in line to apply yeah I
 
04:15:52.429 --> 04:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
think that's a really good question and
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
I was I was hoping to find that answer
 
04:15:57.290 --> 04:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
in the tax credits in the education tax
 
04:16:00.290 --> 04:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
credit program and I did it it did not
 
04:16:02.150 --> 04:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't clear to me in that program
 
04:16:05.689 --> 04:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
that that that it had been defined there
 
04:16:05.699 --> 04:16:07.189 align:start position:0%
that that that it had been defined there
either

04:16:07.189 --> 04:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:16:10.130 --> 04:16:10.140 align:start position:0%
um uh uh but I think I think it
 
04:16:12.710 --> 04:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
certainly would be would be you know
 
04:16:14.929 --> 04:16:14.939 align:start position:0%
responsible on part of the the
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner to uh to put in a budget
 
04:16:19.910 --> 04:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
that that that that that the
 
04:16:22.010 --> 04:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
commissioner feels will satisfy the
 
04:16:23.809 --> 04:16:23.819 align:start position:0%
needs of that program at least we all go
 
04:16:25.969 --> 04:16:25.979 align:start position:0%
into the budget process Eyes Wide Open
 
04:16:28.969 --> 04:16:28.979 align:start position:0%
knowing exactly what this program might
 
04:16:31.130 --> 04:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
uh might be costing based on all the
 
04:16:33.110 --> 04:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
best information that the commissioner
 
04:16:36.530 --> 04:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
of education has as opposed to I I don't
 
04:16:41.150 --> 04:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
know how frankly in in business you
 
04:16:43.490 --> 04:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
would you would be you would be out of a
 
04:16:46.849 --> 04:16:46.859 align:start position:0%
job in a heartbeat if you um you you
 
04:16:48.590 --> 04:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
propose you said something was going to
 
04:16:50.389 --> 04:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
cost three million dollars and ended up
 
04:16:52.490 --> 04:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
costing closer to 25 million dollars
 
04:16:56.210 --> 04:16:56.220 align:start position:0%
that is just laughable so so
 
04:16:59.090 --> 04:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
um it was pretty obvious during the
 
04:17:01.849 --> 04:17:01.859 align:start position:0%
creation of that program that uh that a
 
04:17:03.889 --> 04:17:03.899 align:start position:0%
number of students a number of families
 
04:17:06.710 --> 04:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
of students who were in
 
04:17:09.110 --> 04:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
um private schools and homeschooled uh
 
04:17:12.469 --> 04:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
had already were already being in those
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
um in those education environments would
 
04:17:18.290 --> 04:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh would qualify for vouchers uh we've
 
04:17:21.110 --> 04:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
got over 20 000 students that would that
 
04:17:24.229 --> 04:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
would that are in those programs and um
 
04:17:25.910 --> 04:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
for some reason the Department of
 
04:17:28.729 --> 04:17:28.739 align:start position:0%
Education said we think maybe four of
 
04:17:32.030 --> 04:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
them will Avail themselves of a of a
 
04:17:34.670 --> 04:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
five six seven thousand dollar check I
 
04:17:37.189 --> 04:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
mean that's just phony budgeting that's
 
04:17:40.370 --> 04:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
just irresponsible budgeting and and all
 
04:17:42.410 --> 04:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is uh is put some
 
04:17:44.929 --> 04:17:44.939 align:start position:0%
guard rails on a program that the that
 
04:17:46.849 --> 04:17:46.859 align:start position:0%
the governor has suggested could
 
04:17:48.650 --> 04:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
probably use some
 
04:17:52.010 --> 04:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you very much great
 
04:17:56.750 --> 04:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
thanks very much Mr chairman
 
04:17:58.969 --> 04:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
are there any other pink cards for this
 
04:17:58.979 --> 04:18:01.610 align:start position:0%
are there any other pink cards for this
bill

04:18:01.610 --> 04:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:01.620 --> 04:18:03.889 align:start position:0%

04:18:13.429 --> 04:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
we're on um 573
 
04:18:14.929 --> 04:18:14.939 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
04:18:22.189 --> 04:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:29.889 --> 04:18:29.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:33.170 --> 04:18:33.180 align:start position:0%
I know we had what maybe some pile of
 
04:18:34.729 --> 04:18:34.739 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
04:18:34.739 --> 04:18:37.670 align:start position:0%
one of those

04:19:07.849 --> 04:19:07.859 align:start position:0%
this bill I looked at it from the
 
04:19:09.469 --> 04:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
perspective of a parent of a child with
 
04:19:11.929 --> 04:19:11.939 align:start position:0%

his community
 
04:19:29.510 --> 04:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
but he relies on Services through the
 
04:19:31.849 --> 04:19:31.859 align:start position:0%
developmental Services System area

agencies in order to continue living a
 
04:19:36.590 --> 04:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
life of value and dignity this is the
 
04:19:38.630 --> 04:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
budget year so soon I and many other
 
04:19:42.410 --> 04:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
families will be spending our afternoons
 
04:19:45.590 --> 04:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
and evenings at budget hearings to
 
04:19:47.630 --> 04:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
advocate for adequate funding for the
 
04:19:49.429 --> 04:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
services that our loved ones need not
 
04:19:51.950 --> 04:19:51.960 align:start position:0%

and then having to work with the amount
 
04:20:03.710 --> 04:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
budgeted the EFA program has no such
 
04:20:06.229 --> 04:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
constraints it's like a program with a
 
04:20:07.610 --> 04:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
platinum card with no credit limit
 
04:20:10.309 --> 04:20:10.319 align:start position:0%

and responsibilities of the scholarship
 
04:45:54.600 --> 04:45:56.030 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities of the scholarship

04:45:56.030 --> 04:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
organization
 
04:45:57.948 --> 04:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor is representative little

committee for the record David luno
 
04:46:05.810 --> 04:46:05.820 align:start position:0%
representing the people of Merrimack

County District 9 the towns of Beau and

Concord in that too
 
04:46:16.730 --> 04:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm honored to bring forward
 
04:46:21.288 --> 04:46:21.298 align:start position:0%
House Bill 621 it's the uh the the final
 
04:46:26.150 --> 04:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
one in um and I think our our basket of
 
04:46:29.090 --> 04:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
of accountability transparency and
 
04:46:31.010 --> 04:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
oversight bills with respect to the
 
04:46:34.250 --> 04:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account uh program and
 
04:46:36.170 --> 04:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
uh if
 
04:46:40.010 --> 04:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
if 621 looks familiar to uh to some of
 
04:46:41.990 --> 04:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
the members on this committee it's
 
04:46:44.390 --> 04:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
because it is and
 
04:46:47.330 --> 04:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
um and it was uh brought forward
 
04:46:50.090 --> 04:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
um by its prime sponsor last year uh
 
04:46:52.430 --> 04:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
former member representative Bonnie Hamm
 
04:46:58.850 --> 04:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
and um and uh as as she did last year uh
 
04:47:01.128 --> 04:47:01.138 align:start position:0%
this bill also has bipartisan
 
04:47:05.330 --> 04:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
sponsorship uh on it and uh and is a
 
04:47:08.930 --> 04:47:08.940 align:start position:0%
relatively light touch on the the EFA
 
04:47:12.110 --> 04:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
program and I hope tightening up some
 
04:47:15.770 --> 04:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
Provisions that that we all
 
04:47:20.750 --> 04:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
um agree make sense and so so without
 
04:47:22.730 --> 04:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
um a whole lot of delay and taking up
 
04:47:24.830 --> 04:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
the committee's time I'll sort of turn
 
04:47:28.670 --> 04:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
to um turn to the first section of the
 
04:47:30.170 --> 04:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
04:47:35.030 --> 04:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
and it's directed to to changes when a
 
04:47:38.750 --> 04:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh when an EFA student enrolls as a
 
04:47:41.448 --> 04:47:41.458 align:start position:0%
full-time student in their resident
 
04:47:46.250 --> 04:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
Public School District and um and
 
04:47:49.490 --> 04:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
basically it uh it it
 
04:47:51.530 --> 04:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
makes it simple
 
04:47:53.930 --> 04:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
um the if an EFA student enrolls
 
04:47:56.448 --> 04:47:56.458 align:start position:0%
full-time in their
 
04:47:59.628 --> 04:47:59.638 align:start position:0%
Public School District where they live
 
04:48:03.890 --> 04:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
in in of their residence then um then
 
04:48:05.208 --> 04:48:05.218 align:start position:0%
number one
 
04:48:07.310 --> 04:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
immediate suspension of payments of
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
additional funds into the student's EFA
 
04:48:11.628 --> 04:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
so these are funds that are directed
 
04:48:14.390 --> 04:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education they
 
04:48:16.128 --> 04:48:16.138 align:start position:0%
come out of the trust fund and they get
 
04:48:19.910 --> 04:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
deposited into the the EFA number two it
 
04:48:24.230 --> 04:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
terminates the EFA and number three any
 
04:48:26.390 --> 04:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
remaining funds being transferred back
 
04:48:29.930 --> 04:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh I mean sorry in the EFA in that
 
04:48:32.930 --> 04:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
student CFA get transferred back to the
 
04:48:37.070 --> 04:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
education trust fund the um the rest of
 
04:48:37.080 --> 04:48:38.448 align:start position:0%
education trust fund the um the rest of
the

04:48:38.448 --> 04:48:38.458 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:48:40.270 --> 04:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
um the bill
 
04:48:42.830 --> 04:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
tightens up
 
04:48:47.270 --> 04:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the in 194 f with respect
 
04:48:51.890 --> 04:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
to suspected cases of Fraud and um and
 
04:48:53.930 --> 04:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
it basically considers
 
04:48:53.940 --> 04:48:56.030 align:start position:0%
it basically considers
the

04:48:56.030 --> 04:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:48:58.930 --> 04:48:58.940 align:start position:0%
uh what the scholarship organization's
 
04:49:03.350 --> 04:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh uh is when uh when
 
04:49:06.470 --> 04:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
there's a suspected cases of fraud it
 
04:49:08.810 --> 04:49:08.820 align:start position:0%
talks about what the student's
 
04:49:12.350 --> 04:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
eligibility uh will be in in terms of
 
04:49:15.050 --> 04:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
continuing in the uh the EFA program
 
04:49:17.868 --> 04:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
when they're suspect suspected cases of
 
04:49:20.810 --> 04:49:20.820 align:start position:0%
Fraud and um and then I think most
 
04:49:24.128 --> 04:49:24.138 align:start position:0%
importantly on lines 28 through 30
 
04:49:28.430 --> 04:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
it changes the word may to shall when uh
 
04:49:31.610 --> 04:49:31.620 align:start position:0%
when the scholarship organization
 
04:49:31.620 --> 04:49:34.270 align:start position:0%
when the scholarship organization
uh

04:49:34.270 --> 04:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:49:37.490 --> 04:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
identifies a suspected case of fraud
 
04:49:40.150 --> 04:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
that it shall
 
04:49:44.208 --> 04:49:44.218 align:start position:0%
refer those uh cases to the attorney
 
04:49:47.868 --> 04:49:47.878 align:start position:0%
general for investigation and um and
 
04:49:51.590 --> 04:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's basically it
 
04:49:51.600 --> 04:49:53.930 align:start position:0%
that's that's basically it
um

04:49:53.930 --> 04:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:56.810 --> 04:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
what happens to uh to the efas when a
 
04:49:59.208 --> 04:49:59.218 align:start position:0%
full-time when a EFA student enrolls
 
04:50:01.670 --> 04:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
full-time in their public school
 
04:50:03.708 --> 04:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
district of residence it's where they
 
04:50:06.708 --> 04:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
live and what happens when there's
 
04:50:12.530 --> 04:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:16.810 --> 04:50:16.820 align:start position:0%
that's really it I mean I hope
 
04:50:20.030 --> 04:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
that uh that you know the the the light
 
04:50:22.910 --> 04:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
touch that uh that house bill 621 makes
 
04:50:26.810 --> 04:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
on the uh the the existing EFA statute
 
04:50:29.270 --> 04:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
is something that's uh certainly
 
04:50:32.208 --> 04:50:32.218 align:start position:0%
reasonable and acceptable by all the
 
04:50:34.310 --> 04:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
members of this committee uh I don't
 
04:50:36.110 --> 04:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
have any reason to think that the uh
 
04:50:38.270 --> 04:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
that the governor would would find these
 
04:50:41.150 --> 04:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
changes to be anything less than some of
 
04:50:43.368 --> 04:50:43.378 align:start position:0%
the most reasonable changes that that
 
04:50:45.650 --> 04:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
you would put in place to number one
 
04:50:48.948 --> 04:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
protect uh local taxpayers uh interests
 
04:50:52.070 --> 04:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
and um and number and also right there
 
04:50:54.470 --> 04:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
with it protect the interest of of
 
04:50:57.830 --> 04:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um all across the state uh in
 
04:51:00.830 --> 04:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
the case that um or in cases where where
 
04:51:02.930 --> 04:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
there might be a suspected case of of
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
fraud which uh which um does happen we
 
04:51:08.270 --> 04:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
heard the commissioner say it uh it
 
04:51:11.690 --> 04:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
happens in other states and um and uh so
 
04:51:13.670 --> 04:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
I think having the uh having those guard
 
04:51:16.190 --> 04:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
rails here in New Hampshire would would
 
04:51:17.270 --> 04:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
make a lot of
 
04:51:21.110 --> 04:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh with that I'll conclude remarks and
 
04:51:22.850 --> 04:51:22.860 align:start position:0%
take a few questions thank you very much
 
04:51:24.770 --> 04:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
uh represent McDonald
 
04:51:27.590 --> 04:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you again
 
04:51:31.490 --> 04:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
I'm looking specifically at page one the
 
04:51:34.610 --> 04:51:34.620 align:start position:0%
last paragraph lines 28 for 30. it says
 
04:51:36.948 --> 04:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
a scholarship organization shall refer
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
suspected cases of substantial misuse of
 
04:51:41.628 --> 04:51:41.638 align:start position:0%
EFA funds to the attorney general for
 
04:51:44.090 --> 04:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
investigation and then the bill strikes
 
04:51:47.150 --> 04:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
out if evidence of fraudulent use of EFA
 
04:51:49.550 --> 04:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
funds is obtained
 
04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
so would this bill or is the intent of
 
04:51:54.830 --> 04:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
this bill to increase the number of
 
04:51:58.010 --> 04:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
trials that proceed without evidence and
 
04:52:01.070 --> 04:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
do not have an evidential basis and
 
04:52:03.650 --> 04:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that increase
 
04:52:06.288 --> 04:52:06.298 align:start position:0%
the amount of money going forward in
 
04:52:09.110 --> 04:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
trials and that's an added expense no no
 
04:52:11.030 --> 04:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very very much for
 
04:52:13.550 --> 04:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
the question no it simply refers it to
 
04:52:15.770 --> 04:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
the Eternal attorney general for
 
04:52:20.150 --> 04:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
investigation and um and you know it it
 
04:52:20.160 --> 04:52:21.050 align:start position:0%
investigation and um and you know it it
um

04:52:21.050 --> 04:52:21.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:23.570 --> 04:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
you know the Attorney General is in a
 
04:52:26.570 --> 04:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
very unique um has a very unique role in
 
04:52:28.128 --> 04:52:28.138 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because they've got
 
04:52:30.310 --> 04:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
trained law enforcement
 
04:52:34.128 --> 04:52:34.138 align:start position:0%
officials on their staff that are that
 
04:52:35.810 --> 04:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
know how to professionally handle
 
04:52:38.868 --> 04:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
investigations draw out ever evidence
 
04:52:40.910 --> 04:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
and and determine whether or not
 
04:52:43.970 --> 04:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
something is fit to to go to a trial
 
04:52:46.490 --> 04:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
because I agree in some cases you may
 
04:52:48.890 --> 04:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
want to take this to trial if if the
 
04:52:51.650 --> 04:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
fraud if the amount of fraud represents
 
04:52:54.650 --> 04:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
you know was was beyond a certain number
 
04:52:57.830 --> 04:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
I think it may qualify for one level of
 
04:53:01.128 --> 04:53:01.138 align:start position:0%
um of um of misdemeanor if it's above
 
04:53:03.410 --> 04:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
another number it's it qualifies for a
 
04:53:07.128 --> 04:53:07.138 align:start position:0%
different level of of misdemeanor and um
 
04:53:08.868 --> 04:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
and the Attorney General I think is is
 
04:53:11.810 --> 04:53:11.820 align:start position:0%
in a position to investigate it collect
 
04:53:15.230 --> 04:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
that evidence and um and I you know I
 
04:53:18.948 --> 04:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not going to speak for what the
 
04:53:20.990 --> 04:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
um children's scholarships has in terms
 
04:53:22.510 --> 04:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
04:53:22.520 --> 04:53:24.070 align:start position:0%
terms of
investigatory

04:53:24.070 --> 04:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
investigatory
 
04:53:28.128 --> 04:53:28.138 align:start position:0%
capacity but but I think should the
 
04:53:30.288 --> 04:53:30.298 align:start position:0%
should the children's scholarship fund
 
04:53:33.770 --> 04:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
have a reason to suspect fraud
 
04:53:35.628 --> 04:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
and they're the ones that are reviewing
 
04:53:38.390 --> 04:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
all of the requests that come in then
 
04:53:41.150 --> 04:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
they can get it off their lap and get it
 
04:53:42.530 --> 04:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
over the Attorney General's office
 
04:53:44.690 --> 04:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office investigates
 
04:53:46.610 --> 04:53:46.620 align:start position:0%
and then I go hey you know what not a
 
04:53:48.410 --> 04:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
problem here so to summarize what you
 
04:53:50.570 --> 04:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
said the intent of the bill is not to
 
04:53:52.368 --> 04:53:52.378 align:start position:0%
increase the number of Trials nor the
 
04:53:54.590 --> 04:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
expenses relating to trials but that
 
04:53:57.770 --> 04:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
might be the result it may be the it it
 
04:54:01.550 --> 04:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
may be the result if um if if New
 
04:54:01.560 --> 04:54:02.470 align:start position:0%
may be the result if um if if New
Hampshire

04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:54:04.970 --> 04:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
experiences what has been experienced in
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
other states uh where uh where where
 
04:54:11.090 --> 04:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
there have been cases of of substantial
 
04:54:13.970 --> 04:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
fraud which is a which is a rip-off on
 
04:54:16.070 --> 04:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers and I certainly think the
 
04:54:17.930 --> 04:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in New Hampshire would expect
 
04:54:20.448 --> 04:54:20.458 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General to would expect
 
04:54:23.810 --> 04:54:23.820 align:start position:0%
that the Attorney General respects their
 
04:54:27.350 --> 04:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money uh is is going towards um
 
04:54:27.360 --> 04:54:28.670 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money uh is is going towards um
towards

04:54:28.670 --> 04:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
towards
 
04:54:33.368 --> 04:54:33.378 align:start position:0%
purposes that were designed as as as as
 
04:54:36.830 --> 04:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
important by the program and not to take
 
04:54:39.590 --> 04:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
advantage of um you know of public money
 
04:54:43.190 --> 04:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you represent Belcher
 
04:54:44.628 --> 04:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:54:45.890 --> 04:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
taking the question I'd just like to
 
04:54:48.410 --> 04:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
follow up just a little bit on the line
 
04:54:50.868 --> 04:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
of questioning uh Rhett McDonald was on
 
04:54:53.930 --> 04:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
on page 128 through 30. can you just
 
04:54:56.208 --> 04:54:56.218 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit to the rationale
 
04:54:58.970 --> 04:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
behind requiring the scholarship
 
04:55:01.850 --> 04:55:01.860 align:start position:0%
organization to refer cases to the
 
04:55:03.288 --> 04:55:03.298 align:start position:0%
attorney general who does Criminal
 
04:55:03.298 --> 04:55:04.670 align:start position:0%
attorney general who does Criminal
investigations

04:55:04.670 --> 04:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
04:55:09.530 --> 04:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
when there is no evidence of fraud
 
04:55:13.070 --> 04:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
because that last line is struck here
 
04:55:15.770 --> 04:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
yeah so so you know if the scholarship
 
04:55:19.550 --> 04:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
organization has um has refer suspected
 
04:55:23.510 --> 04:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh cases of substantial misuse so so
 
04:55:26.208 --> 04:55:26.218 align:start position:0%
obviously you know the the Department of
 
04:55:27.948 --> 04:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
Education has rule-making Authority
 
04:55:30.590 --> 04:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
Under 541a where they can Define what
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
substantial misuses I'm sure in
 
04:55:33.890 --> 04:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the Department of
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
Justice they can determine what that
 
04:55:38.690 --> 04:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
level it is whether that means five
 
04:55:40.490 --> 04:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars or five thousand dollars
 
04:55:42.890 --> 04:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
or fifty thousand dollars I I you know
 
04:55:47.270 --> 04:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's beyond I think our pay grade but
 
04:55:50.750 --> 04:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
um but I think the um the that could be
 
04:55:54.770 --> 04:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
borne out in rules and uh you know we we
 
04:55:57.530 --> 04:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh we did not we left the word
 
04:55:59.690 --> 04:55:59.700 align:start position:0%
substantial in there so I mean this
 
04:56:02.510 --> 04:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
isn't about misappropriating a postage
 
04:56:05.330 --> 04:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
stamp on uh on something it's got to
 
04:56:07.910 --> 04:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
obviously be greater than some
 
04:56:10.070 --> 04:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable threshold
 
04:56:13.430 --> 04:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
um to what to to be captured and under
 
04:56:16.250 --> 04:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
the substantial misuse if I may just
 
04:56:18.110 --> 04:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
real briefly follow up
 
04:56:19.250 --> 04:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
um can you speak at all to the
 
04:56:20.448 --> 04:56:20.458 align:start position:0%
difference in New Hampshire criminal
 
04:56:22.368 --> 04:56:22.378 align:start position:0%
code between substantial misuse and
 
04:56:22.378 --> 04:56:23.390 align:start position:0%
code between substantial misuse and
fraud

04:56:23.390 --> 04:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
04:56:26.090 --> 04:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
I I can't no thank you but if there's an
 
04:56:27.948 --> 04:56:27.958 align:start position:0%
attorney from the um from the Department
 
04:56:29.930 --> 04:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
of Education perhaps they would be able
 
04:56:29.940 --> 04:56:30.948 align:start position:0%
of Education perhaps they would be able
to

04:56:30.948 --> 04:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:56:32.510 --> 04:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:56:35.090 --> 04:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
going to representative Damon
 
04:56:36.590 --> 04:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:56:38.208 --> 04:56:38.218 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:56:44.230 --> 04:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
um so would it be correct to conclude
 
04:56:50.750 --> 04:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
given lines 19 20 through
 
04:56:53.810 --> 04:56:53.820 align:start position:0%
sorry uh 24.
 
04:56:53.820 --> 04:56:55.368 align:start position:0%
sorry uh 24.
that

04:56:55.368 --> 04:56:55.378 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:56:57.708 --> 04:56:57.718 align:start position:0%
if this is already those lines well it's
 
04:56:59.628 --> 04:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
changing made a shout
 
04:57:02.090 --> 04:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
so if those actions the audit and so
 
04:57:04.550 --> 04:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
forth are taking place that seems to me
 
04:57:07.128 --> 04:57:07.138 align:start position:0%
it would lead to either everything is
 
04:57:10.610 --> 04:57:10.620 align:start position:0%
fine or something is amiss and therefore
 
04:57:12.470 --> 04:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
the data to refer to the Attorney
 
04:57:14.470 --> 04:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
General's office would be
 
04:57:16.850 --> 04:57:16.860 align:start position:0%
rationally obtained yeah I think that's
 
04:57:18.770 --> 04:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
a reasonable conclusion for me thank you
 
04:57:21.708 --> 04:57:21.718 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative Ford
 
04:57:23.750 --> 04:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:57:26.208 --> 04:57:26.218 align:start position:0%
my question I'm a bit concerned about
 
04:57:30.310 --> 04:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
the immediacy excuse me
 
04:57:32.690 --> 04:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
that's that's a purpose to my question
 
04:57:36.490 --> 04:57:36.500 align:start position:0%
is how would you provide some protection
 
04:57:39.770 --> 04:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
for some step that had been taken to
 
04:57:42.410 --> 04:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
assist the student I think of physical
 
04:57:44.628 --> 04:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
things like a hearing aid or or
 
04:57:46.910 --> 04:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
something which might not be completely
 
04:57:49.430 --> 04:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
paid for or something it might be
 
04:57:52.190 --> 04:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
contracted for for a period of time and
 
04:57:54.650 --> 04:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
not be finished and if you immediately
 
04:57:57.110 --> 04:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
suspend payment then they might not
 
04:57:59.628 --> 04:57:59.638 align:start position:0%
complete something which is part of the
 
04:58:02.448 --> 04:58:02.458 align:start position:0%
process of helping them improve and I
 
04:58:05.270 --> 04:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
that that was my my concern with the
 
04:58:07.730 --> 04:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
with the immediacy language yeah yeah
 
04:58:09.770 --> 04:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
and and I think that's uh I think that's
 
04:58:12.470 --> 04:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
a fair question and and and there's
 
04:58:15.110 --> 04:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
there's probably enough enough here
 
04:58:18.368 --> 04:58:18.378 align:start position:0%
where rules could um could could could
 
04:58:21.410 --> 04:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
tighten up on on that a little bit more
 
04:58:24.170 --> 04:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
but but I think it also sets a fairly
 
04:58:28.090 --> 04:58:28.100 align:start position:0%
High bar for the um for for rule making
 
04:58:34.270 --> 04:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:37.690 --> 04:58:37.700 align:start position:0%
suspect a substantial uh
 
04:58:41.868 --> 04:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
misuse of EFA funds uh what what that is
 
04:58:44.510 --> 04:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
and and you know if it wasn't any
 
04:58:48.110 --> 04:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
example of of um of a um you know a
 
04:58:49.670 --> 04:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
hearing device or something like that
 
04:58:52.368 --> 04:58:52.378 align:start position:0%
maybe that wouldn't qualify but uh you
 
04:58:55.430 --> 04:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
know in Arizona uh somebody bought I
 
04:58:59.330 --> 04:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
think a um a um uh you know some sort of
 
04:59:01.970 --> 04:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
you know you know uh what are they
 
04:59:04.970 --> 04:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
called The Wave Runners the sea Doos uh
 
04:59:07.550 --> 04:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
and uh and you know and those usually
 
04:59:09.590 --> 04:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
cost thousands and thousands of dollars
 
04:59:12.948 --> 04:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
and and that probably created a red flag
 
04:59:16.970 --> 04:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
for um for the um the you know the con
 
04:59:19.610 --> 04:59:19.620 align:start position:0%
the company or or the the department
 
04:59:22.368 --> 04:59:22.378 align:start position:0%
that oversees the the accounts in
 
04:59:23.810 --> 04:59:23.820 align:start position:0%
Arizona to say hey you know what maybe
 
04:59:26.050 --> 04:59:26.060 align:start position:0%
we got something going on here
 
04:59:30.110 --> 04:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:59:31.910 --> 04:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli
 
04:59:34.788 --> 04:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
thank you along those same lines
 
04:59:37.490 --> 04:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
representative I'm looking more up at
 
04:59:41.628 --> 04:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
the top five through uh 13.
 
04:59:45.288 --> 04:59:45.298 align:start position:0%
um and enrolling back in your resident
 
04:59:47.690 --> 04:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
Public School District there still could
 
04:59:50.530 --> 04:59:50.540 align:start position:0%
be outstanding
 
04:59:50.540 --> 04:59:52.208 align:start position:0%
be outstanding
charges

04:59:52.208 --> 04:59:52.218 align:start position:0%
charges
 
04:59:55.070 --> 04:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
the scholarship fund goes through an
 
04:59:57.970 --> 04:59:57.980 align:start position:0%
extensive auditing period
 
05:00:00.730 --> 05:00:00.740 align:start position:0%
when they get
 
05:00:05.510 --> 05:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
an invoice for a payment for an
 
05:00:07.690 --> 05:00:07.700 align:start position:0%
educational expense
 
05:00:10.690 --> 05:00:10.700 align:start position:0%
and if you cut off
 
05:00:13.730 --> 05:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
the remaining funds in their account and
 
05:00:15.410 --> 05:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
terminate the account right when they
 
05:00:15.420 --> 05:00:17.208 align:start position:0%
terminate the account right when they
enroll

05:00:17.208 --> 05:00:17.218 align:start position:0%
enroll
 
05:00:19.970 --> 05:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
um aren't we in danger of
 
05:00:22.930 --> 05:00:22.940 align:start position:0%
um stopping a parent from being
 
05:00:26.150 --> 05:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for a computer or something
 
05:00:28.910 --> 05:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
like that possibly
 
05:00:31.970 --> 05:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
um uh thanks thanks for the question I
 
05:00:36.050 --> 05:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
mean this is a student that was uh was
 
05:00:38.208 --> 05:00:38.218 align:start position:0%
an EFA student and is now going back
 
05:00:41.150 --> 05:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
into their public school I you know if
 
05:00:43.670 --> 05:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
if they if the day before they put in
 
05:00:47.208 --> 05:00:47.218 align:start position:0%
for uh for uh uh I don't know like a
 
05:00:50.270 --> 05:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
1200 reimbursement for um for a laptop
 
05:00:52.610 --> 05:00:52.620 align:start position:0%
to be able to take that back into their
 
05:00:55.368 --> 05:00:55.378 align:start position:0%
Public Schools I I don't know I mean I I
 
05:00:58.910 --> 05:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
know I I I think many taxpayers would
 
05:01:01.490 --> 05:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
say that's not what the EFA program was
 
05:01:01.500 --> 05:01:02.448 align:start position:0%
say that's not what the EFA program was
about

05:01:02.448 --> 05:01:02.458 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:01:04.490 --> 05:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
um uh if students are planning on being
 
05:01:06.890 --> 05:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
in their Public School leave for a day
 
05:01:09.410 --> 05:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
get a laptop and then go back into their
 
05:01:12.770 --> 05:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
public school you know I I think that
 
05:01:16.250 --> 05:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
would would honestly if it didn't if it
 
05:01:18.110 --> 05:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
didn't get caught in the first section I
 
05:01:19.490 --> 05:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
think probably should get caught in the
 
05:01:21.590 --> 05:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
second section
 
05:01:23.448 --> 05:01:23.458 align:start position:0%
further questions of the committee
 
05:01:27.170 --> 05:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:29.570 --> 05:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
I want to just follow up on that but
 
05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
that wasn't the point of my question but
 
05:01:33.830 --> 05:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
it says the EFA that has been open for
 
05:01:35.868 --> 05:01:35.878 align:start position:0%
at least one full school year
 
05:01:37.788 --> 05:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
and so that's not going to be leave for
 
05:01:40.250 --> 05:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
a day get a laptop and go back that's
 
05:01:41.570 --> 05:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
going to be something they were working
 
05:01:43.190 --> 05:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
on and then whatever happened they
 
05:01:44.868 --> 05:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
decided maybe their life changed and
 
05:01:47.628 --> 05:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
they could no longer homeschool them I
 
05:01:49.070 --> 05:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
mean whatever and now they have to
 
05:01:50.868 --> 05:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
enroll the kid but they've already
 
05:01:53.930 --> 05:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
committed contracted to have whatever it
 
05:01:55.430 --> 05:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
was that was ordered and they're waiting
 
05:01:57.890 --> 05:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement yeah you know you know
 
05:01:59.750 --> 05:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
possibly the product could be returned
 
05:02:02.990 --> 05:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh I know uh you know at least the the I
 
05:02:05.930 --> 05:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
think the number one vendor in the EFA
 
05:02:08.510 --> 05:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
program has a pretty generous um you
 
05:02:11.868 --> 05:02:11.878 align:start position:0%
know return uh policy and uh you know if
 
05:02:14.570 --> 05:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
that covers those the majority of maybe
 
05:02:18.830 --> 05:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
that specific case you know I I
 
05:02:22.490 --> 05:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
yeah you know I I I I I I just think
 
05:02:24.470 --> 05:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's pretty straightforward
 
05:02:27.410 --> 05:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
that if you're enrolling as a full-time
 
05:02:29.770 --> 05:02:29.780 align:start position:0%
student in your resident School District
 
05:02:33.410 --> 05:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
that uh that you know you're you're
 
05:02:35.570 --> 05:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're terminating the EFA
 
05:02:38.510 --> 05:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
and uh and funds drop back into the
 
05:02:40.490 --> 05:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
education trust fund because the
 
05:02:43.850 --> 05:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
education trust fund uh will have um
 
05:02:45.948 --> 05:02:45.958 align:start position:0%
you know we'll have you know costs that
 
05:02:48.110 --> 05:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
it needs to uh you know in terms of
 
05:02:50.570 --> 05:02:50.580 align:start position:0%
adequacy that it needs to uh send to the
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
school district too so now the question
 
05:02:56.090 --> 05:02:56.100 align:start position:0%
that I was going to ask if that's okay
 
05:03:00.890 --> 05:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
and that is do you see this
 
05:03:04.610 --> 05:03:04.620 align:start position:0%
sort of I guess use it or lose it kind
 
05:03:06.470 --> 05:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
of rule that your law that you're
 
05:03:09.650 --> 05:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
putting in being something that would
 
05:03:12.590 --> 05:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
encourage student with discourage
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
parents from saving EFA money because
 
05:03:20.208 --> 05:03:20.218 align:start position:0%
things with things when you're in later
 
05:03:22.190 --> 05:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
grades cost more than when you're in
 
05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
younger grades and so it would make
 
05:03:26.628 --> 05:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
sense for parents to
 
05:03:28.970 --> 05:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
save that money so when they get in the
 
05:03:31.550 --> 05:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
older grades they have it available for
 
05:03:34.368 --> 05:03:34.378 align:start position:0%
you know the more expensive things and
 
05:03:37.788 --> 05:03:37.798 align:start position:0%
do you think this would encourage saving
 
05:03:40.850 --> 05:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
or discourage saving if if they realize
 
05:03:42.890 --> 05:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
that oh if something happens and my kid
 
05:03:45.470 --> 05:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
has to go back in the school we've lost
 
05:03:47.570 --> 05:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
it all even if it's just for a year they
 
05:03:50.448 --> 05:03:50.458 align:start position:0%
have to go back yeah so if if a student
 
05:03:53.390 --> 05:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
is is exiting the EFA to go back to
 
05:03:55.670 --> 05:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
their um their their public school I
 
05:03:57.530 --> 05:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
think this I stand by the language here
 
05:04:00.530 --> 05:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
that that you terminate the account and
 
05:04:02.090 --> 05:04:02.100 align:start position:0%
uh and you just move forward they've
 
05:04:04.430 --> 05:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
obviously made some decisions if they
 
05:04:06.350 --> 05:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
want to wait for the laptop to arrive
 
05:04:08.868 --> 05:04:08.878 align:start position:0%
and get reimbursed and then go back in I
 
05:04:10.730 --> 05:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
mean families can make make their own
 
05:04:13.250 --> 05:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
decisions I think if a family did make a
 
05:04:15.410 --> 05:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
decision based on that wait till the
 
05:04:17.390 --> 05:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
check comes in to pay for the laptop and
 
05:04:19.970 --> 05:04:19.980 align:start position:0%
then drop the EFA the next day and ran
 
05:04:22.070 --> 05:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
to their public school I think taxpayers
 
05:04:24.110 --> 05:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
might feel that that they got cheated on
 
05:04:26.090 --> 05:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
that one
 
05:04:28.128 --> 05:04:28.138 align:start position:0%
brother further questions representative
 
05:04:28.138 --> 05:04:29.410 align:start position:0%
brother further questions representative
Cornell

05:04:29.410 --> 05:04:29.420 align:start position:0%
Cornell
 
05:04:32.510 --> 05:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
if this is a question for a rep Luna but
 
05:04:34.730 --> 05:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
um replica just said that they might
 
05:04:36.530 --> 05:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
save up in the earlier grades for
 
05:04:38.150 --> 05:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
something bigger in the later grades and
 
05:04:40.850 --> 05:04:40.860 align:start position:0%
I didn't know there was carryover on is
 
05:04:42.590 --> 05:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
there you can save it from year to year
 
05:04:48.590 --> 05:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:51.110 --> 05:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
represent Balboni again I'm sorry
 
05:04:52.910 --> 05:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
because I didn't realize that either I
 
05:04:55.070 --> 05:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
have another question so literally you
 
05:04:57.890 --> 05:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
can save it all the if you start your
 
05:04:59.690 --> 05:04:59.700 align:start position:0%
child in kindergarten and you don't use
 
05:05:01.368 --> 05:05:01.378 align:start position:0%
up the funds every year you're in the
 
05:05:03.590 --> 05:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
program you can save an undetermined
 
05:05:07.250 --> 05:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
amount of money if you don't use it
 
05:05:10.128 --> 05:05:10.138 align:start position:0%
and there's no limit I've never read
 
05:05:13.010 --> 05:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
anything about that right yeah yeah you
 
05:05:14.448 --> 05:05:14.458 align:start position:0%
can roll over the funds from year to
 
05:05:18.770 --> 05:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:22.010 --> 05:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
we'll have Kate answer that as soon as
 
05:05:25.250 --> 05:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
um I've got a question for you though um
 
05:05:29.628 --> 05:05:29.638 align:start position:0%
uh a young man is going to Argyle is
 
05:05:32.810 --> 05:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
going to a Montessori School in using
 
05:05:35.448 --> 05:05:35.458 align:start position:0%
EFA money to pay for that
 
05:05:37.490 --> 05:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
paid all the tuition at the front side
 
05:05:39.830 --> 05:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
after four weeks decides up I'm going to
 
05:05:42.650 --> 05:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
come back to the regular Public School
 
05:05:44.690 --> 05:05:44.700 align:start position:0%
the money's already been sent to the
 
05:05:47.208 --> 05:05:47.218 align:start position:0%
Montessori what what's the relationship
 
05:05:48.948 --> 05:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
of the parent now do they have to
 
05:05:51.890 --> 05:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
obligate to pay that money back or
 
05:05:55.128 --> 05:05:55.138 align:start position:0%
what's the deal here I I have no idea
 
05:05:58.070 --> 05:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
how that how that works and uh that may
 
05:06:00.770 --> 05:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
be a good question for uh for Ms Demers
 
05:06:00.780 --> 05:06:02.628 align:start position:0%
be a good question for uh for Ms Demers
okay

05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:06:05.628 --> 05:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
further questions uh rep San luno not
 
05:06:08.090 --> 05:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
seeing any uh thank you very much thank
 
05:06:11.030 --> 05:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
you very much uh okay you know I know
 
05:06:12.470 --> 05:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
you didn't fill out a pink card or I
 
05:06:14.090 --> 05:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
don't have one on but are you there for
 
05:06:15.650 --> 05:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
technical support too
 
05:06:26.090 --> 05:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:28.010 --> 05:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
several questions were asked could you
 
05:06:30.050 --> 05:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
help us out with those
 
05:06:30.060 --> 05:06:32.750 align:start position:0%
help us out with those
yeah okay

05:06:32.750 --> 05:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:35.090 --> 05:06:35.100 align:start position:0%
Baker from children's scholarship fund
 
05:06:36.708 --> 05:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
thanks this is exactly why I hung around
 
05:06:38.770 --> 05:06:38.780 align:start position:0%
for technical support
 
05:06:41.930 --> 05:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
it is not use it or lose it the
 
05:06:44.690 --> 05:06:44.700 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts so to
 
05:06:48.288 --> 05:06:48.298 align:start position:0%
increase the family's way of looking at
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
it so that they'll be fiscally
 
05:06:51.948 --> 05:06:51.958 align:start position:0%
responsible so in other states when
 
05:06:54.350 --> 05:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
people found that they gave money to
 
05:06:55.490 --> 05:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
families and they said you have a
 
05:06:57.590 --> 05:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars you have to use it they
 
05:06:59.330 --> 05:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
didn't use it the way we would want them
 
05:07:01.070 --> 05:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
to use it in New Hampshire with our kind
 
05:07:03.288 --> 05:07:03.298 align:start position:0%
of you know fiscal Prudence so making
 
05:07:05.810 --> 05:07:05.820 align:start position:0%
the amount that they don't use roll
 
05:07:08.448 --> 05:07:08.458 align:start position:0%
forward into the next year encourages
 
05:07:10.970 --> 05:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
them to be fiscally responsible because
 
05:07:12.708 --> 05:07:12.718 align:start position:0%
they don't have that emergency feeling
 
05:07:14.570 --> 05:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
like oh no I'm going to lose this money
 
05:07:17.150 --> 05:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
so I better use it there's a small
 
05:07:19.550 --> 05:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
percentage of families that do like
 
05:07:21.470 --> 05:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative leckis described think
 
05:07:21.480 --> 05:07:22.490 align:start position:0%
representative leckis described think
ahead

05:07:22.490 --> 05:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
05:07:23.930 --> 05:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
and they're thinking when I get to
 
05:07:25.368 --> 05:07:25.378 align:start position:0%
Middle School the tuition is going to be
 
05:07:27.410 --> 05:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
higher so I'm going to use x amount of
 
05:07:29.030 --> 05:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
money out of my education Freedom
 
05:07:30.830 --> 05:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
account to pay for things now and then
 
05:07:32.628 --> 05:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
when I get there I'm going to make a
 
05:07:35.750 --> 05:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
bigger payments and so it is you know a
 
05:07:38.030 --> 05:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
grant given to the family and so the way
 
05:07:39.590 --> 05:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
to think about it is once you've given
 
05:07:41.350 --> 05:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
it to the family now it's in their
 
05:07:43.550 --> 05:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility where they're saying I'm
 
05:07:45.590 --> 05:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
going to use x amount of money now and
 
05:07:47.448 --> 05:07:47.458 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use this money later for
 
05:07:49.190 --> 05:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
something else so does that help answer
 
05:07:52.128 --> 05:07:52.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:54.530 --> 05:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
yes representative mailer thank you Mr
 
05:07:56.868 --> 05:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you for taking my
 
05:08:00.430 --> 05:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
question what's the average EFA
 
05:08:03.530 --> 05:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
48 and some change and um the Department
 
05:08:07.070 --> 05:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
of Education has a page now on their
 
05:08:09.590 --> 05:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
website where all of these reports are
 
05:08:12.050 --> 05:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
and the one at the top is a grid where
 
05:08:13.970 --> 05:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
you can see all the children that are in
 
05:08:15.590 --> 05:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
the program on that that's where they're
 
05:08:18.288 --> 05:08:18.298 align:start position:0%
saying it's 48 for this school year
 
05:08:18.298 --> 05:08:19.730 align:start position:0%
saying it's 48 for this school year
yeah

05:08:19.730 --> 05:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:08:21.530 --> 05:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
so could you please answer that question
 
05:08:23.390 --> 05:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
about the other question the Montessori
 
05:08:26.390 --> 05:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
School yeah so we actually would ask the
 
05:08:28.610 --> 05:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
Montessori School in that case to return
 
05:08:31.128 --> 05:08:31.138 align:start position:0%
the tuition that was unused for the
 
05:08:34.190 --> 05:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
child and we have a mechanism where you
 
05:08:35.628 --> 05:08:35.638 align:start position:0%
know if someone purchases something
 
05:08:37.550 --> 05:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
because we have the digital wallet
 
05:08:40.128 --> 05:08:40.138 align:start position:0%
platform they can return the money right
 
05:08:42.650 --> 05:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
into the child's education Freedom
 
05:08:45.230 --> 05:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
account and so in that case we would ask
 
05:08:46.788 --> 05:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
say you were there for six months and
 
05:08:48.830 --> 05:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
then you withdrew from the Montessori
 
05:08:50.448 --> 05:08:50.458 align:start position:0%
school but you had prepaid for the other
 
05:08:52.550 --> 05:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
six months we would ask the Montessori
 
05:08:53.930 --> 05:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
School to return that money to the
 
05:08:56.208 --> 05:08:56.218 align:start position:0%
child's education Freedom account how
 
05:08:58.190 --> 05:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
does that work many colleges you know if
 
05:09:00.708 --> 05:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
you withdraw in the first few days you
 
05:09:04.550 --> 05:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
get 80 back and then if you you know do
 
05:09:05.930 --> 05:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
it after that you don't get anything
 
05:09:07.730 --> 05:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
back in terms of tuition in my
 
05:09:09.948 --> 05:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
experience the schools are not looking
 
05:09:12.948 --> 05:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
at this money like that they're looking
 
05:09:15.230 --> 05:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
at this like they know it's money coming
 
05:09:17.270 --> 05:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
from the education Freedom account they
 
05:09:19.250 --> 05:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
know that the intended purpose is for
 
05:09:22.490 --> 05:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
that child and so we could make an
 
05:09:24.948 --> 05:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
argument for example Rick that if they
 
05:09:26.750 --> 05:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
kept that money it wouldn't fit in a
 
05:09:29.270 --> 05:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
category right because that money is for
 
05:09:32.150 --> 05:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
tuition for the child it's not to cover
 
05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
their operating costs so I could make an
 
05:09:36.530 --> 05:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
argument that if they kept the money and
 
05:09:38.628 --> 05:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
didn't return it like we would ask them
 
05:09:40.910 --> 05:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
to that it's not an eligible expense
 
05:09:40.920 --> 05:09:43.730 align:start position:0%
to that it's not an eligible expense
then

05:09:43.730 --> 05:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:45.830 --> 05:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
that raised a lot of questions but I
 
05:09:47.750 --> 05:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
mean yeah I think it's in good faith
 
05:09:49.310 --> 05:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
that they would turn their money to the
 
05:09:51.050 --> 05:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
child's education Freedom account if
 
05:09:52.250 --> 05:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
they're not educating the child because
 
05:09:54.050 --> 05:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
in most cases the families are choosing
 
05:09:56.270 --> 05:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
something else that they would direct
 
05:09:58.550 --> 05:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
that money too I see and so they're not
 
05:10:01.788 --> 05:10:01.798 align:start position:0%
retaining money that doesn't directly
 
05:10:03.650 --> 05:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
relate to the student
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
and maybe I've made the rules too strict
 
05:10:08.930 --> 05:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
but you know representative Wright thank
 
05:10:11.810 --> 05:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
you chairman thank you uh can you help
 
05:10:14.510 --> 05:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
us out and uh do you know any examples
 
05:10:18.288 --> 05:10:18.298 align:start position:0%
of reasons someone might want to keep a
 
05:10:20.628 --> 05:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
an EFA account open for a little while
 
05:10:22.550 --> 05:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
longer once they've re-enrolled in a
 
05:10:25.190 --> 05:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
public school so the the reason that
 
05:10:27.288 --> 05:10:27.298 align:start position:0%
they did wrote this in the law the
 
05:10:29.390 --> 05:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
legislators if I remember correctly we
 
05:10:31.550 --> 05:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
might better ask representative cordelli
 
05:10:34.788 --> 05:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
than me but again was to keep that so
 
05:10:36.948 --> 05:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
that it's not use it or lose it right so
 
05:10:38.750 --> 05:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
you're not feeling that emergency to
 
05:10:40.430 --> 05:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
spend the money on things that you don't
 
05:10:44.150 --> 05:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
need and then secondarily if you go back
 
05:10:46.310 --> 05:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
to your public school you might still
 
05:10:48.230 --> 05:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
have needs for example there's quite a
 
05:10:50.390 --> 05:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
few families that contact us that might
 
05:10:52.610 --> 05:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
be enrolled in their public school
 
05:10:54.830 --> 05:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
full-time who wish they also could use
 
05:10:56.448 --> 05:10:56.458 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account for
 
05:10:59.930 --> 05:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
tutoring and supplies and so because
 
05:11:02.628 --> 05:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
it's the grant awarded to the child if
 
05:11:05.030 --> 05:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's for the child's expenses then it's
 
05:11:06.890 --> 05:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
being spent properly
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:11.990 --> 05:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
so you might spend it down on tutoring
 
05:11:13.670 --> 05:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
for example you return to your public
 
05:11:15.288 --> 05:11:15.298 align:start position:0%
school but you're hopeful that you could
 
05:11:17.330 --> 05:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
use a tutor still that you were using
 
05:11:19.368 --> 05:11:19.378 align:start position:0%
for math in the afternoons you might
 
05:11:21.830 --> 05:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
continue to spend down the money in your
 
05:11:24.410 --> 05:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
Grant on a tutor
 
05:11:24.420 --> 05:11:25.970 align:start position:0%
Grant on a tutor
yeah

05:11:25.970 --> 05:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:11:28.128 --> 05:11:28.138 align:start position:0%
and then in that case it would just stay
 
05:11:30.708 --> 05:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
open until it reaches zero there's no
 
05:11:32.448 --> 05:11:32.458 align:start position:0%
time limit on it yeah there's no time
 
05:11:35.208 --> 05:11:35.218 align:start position:0%
limit that's right
 
05:11:38.090 --> 05:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm not following this logic at
 
05:11:40.730 --> 05:11:40.740 align:start position:0%
all here okay so if
 
05:11:43.730 --> 05:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
if you're withdrawn from the
 
05:11:45.410 --> 05:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
um where that money is being used you're
 
05:11:47.150 --> 05:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
back in public school now right or
 
05:11:48.410 --> 05:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
wherever you are yeah you don't get any
 
05:11:51.590 --> 05:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
more deposits how can you then be using
 
05:11:54.050 --> 05:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
an EFA and attending that public school
 
05:11:57.050 --> 05:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
if you're attending full-time
 
05:11:59.030 --> 05:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's how you collect both it sounds like
 
05:12:01.010 --> 05:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
double dipping to me if you've been in
 
05:12:02.270 --> 05:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
the remember it's the money from the
 
05:12:04.250 --> 05:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
prior year though if you don't get any
 
05:12:06.590 --> 05:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
more deposits so imagine I'm just a
 
05:12:08.030 --> 05:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
student I'm gonna just walk us through
 
05:12:11.208 --> 05:12:11.218 align:start position:0%
it so we get it okay I have spent an
 
05:12:12.948 --> 05:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
entire year in the education Freedom
 
05:12:14.990 --> 05:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
account program homeschooling for
 
05:12:16.850 --> 05:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
example okay and I was given the grant
 
05:12:20.390 --> 05:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
of we'll use the average of 4 800 and I
 
05:12:22.788 --> 05:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
paid for online classes and I paid for
 
05:12:24.650 --> 05:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
tutoring and I paid for a computer and I
 
05:12:27.350 --> 05:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
have twenty dollars left in my account
 
05:12:28.850 --> 05:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year I decide I'm
 
05:12:30.410 --> 05:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
going to go back to public school for
 
05:12:32.390 --> 05:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
the fall right I would say I'm
 
05:12:33.770 --> 05:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
transferring to my public school the
 
05:12:35.810 --> 05:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
deposits would stop because you're not
 
05:12:37.670 --> 05:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
re-enrolling in the education Freedom
 
05:12:39.288 --> 05:12:39.298 align:start position:0%
account so you're not getting any more
 
05:12:41.690 --> 05:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
money deposited but that twenty dollars
 
05:12:44.030 --> 05:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
from the prior year is still your Grant
 
05:12:46.190 --> 05:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
from the prior year so you're allowed to
 
05:12:47.990 --> 05:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
spend that twenty dollars on a textbook
 
05:12:49.730 --> 05:12:49.740 align:start position:0%
or a notebook or something that you need
 
05:12:53.590 --> 05:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:55.970 --> 05:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
the money you receive in the current
 
05:12:57.890 --> 05:12:57.900 align:start position:0%
year so you are not in the current year
 
05:12:59.448 --> 05:12:59.458 align:start position:0%
because you've withdrawn so you don't
 
05:13:02.090 --> 05:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
get any more deposits
 
05:13:03.410 --> 05:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
got it
 
05:13:06.590 --> 05:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
Kinda Yeah sort of okay but you keep the
 
05:13:08.448 --> 05:13:08.458 align:start position:0%
grant you've been given
 
05:13:10.490 --> 05:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
so it would be as if a family goes to
 
05:13:12.890 --> 05:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
your public school right you receive the
 
05:13:15.288 --> 05:13:15.298 align:start position:0%
adequacy money from the state I mean do
 
05:13:17.510 --> 05:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
they take it back
 
05:13:19.190 --> 05:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year if they pay the
 
05:13:21.350 --> 05:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
April payment to the district and a
 
05:13:25.010 --> 05:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
child leaves it on May 30th does the
 
05:13:26.930 --> 05:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
district return it to the state
 
05:13:30.470 --> 05:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
they don't it's by the payments so if I
 
05:13:33.530 --> 05:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
keep my forty eight hundred dollars yeah
 
05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
each year you could keep your if you
 
05:13:37.970 --> 05:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
could apply that to college if you've
 
05:13:40.128 --> 05:13:40.138 align:start position:0%
been in it no when you graduate it goes
 
05:13:42.590 --> 05:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
back to the state
 
05:13:44.510 --> 05:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you yes you're welcome you got it
 
05:13:44.520 --> 05:13:45.410 align:start position:0%
thank you yes you're welcome you got it
yeah

05:13:45.410 --> 05:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:13:47.448 --> 05:13:47.458 align:start position:0%
this is fun yeah that is yeah
 
05:13:50.390 --> 05:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli uh thank you
 
05:13:52.490 --> 05:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
um how often during the year are
 
05:13:54.770 --> 05:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
payments made into the EFA account just
 
05:13:57.110 --> 05:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
like to the public school four times so
 
05:13:59.150 --> 05:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
remember you won't get a payment if
 
05:14:00.410 --> 05:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
you've left
 
05:14:02.448 --> 05:14:02.458 align:start position:0%
okay so you have September November
 
05:14:05.930 --> 05:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
January April and so say you've now
 
05:14:07.430 --> 05:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
you've been in the program for a whole
 
05:14:08.628 --> 05:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
year again we're going to do another
 
05:14:11.390 --> 05:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
scenario right now it's September and
 
05:14:13.730 --> 05:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
September I decided I'm gonna stay I'm
 
05:14:16.070 --> 05:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
gonna go to my private school so that I
 
05:14:18.170 --> 05:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
get my September deposit so I have last
 
05:14:19.910 --> 05:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
year I paid for my private school maybe
 
05:14:22.490 --> 05:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
I carried forward 20 bucks that I didn't
 
05:14:25.190 --> 05:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
use last year I'm in September I get my
 
05:14:27.170 --> 05:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
September 20 which is about a thousand
 
05:14:29.930 --> 05:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
dollars now I have a thousand twenty
 
05:14:33.410 --> 05:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
say I stay all the way to October 30th
 
05:14:36.530 --> 05:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
and then I withdraw and go back to the
 
05:14:38.570 --> 05:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
public school I wouldn't get November
 
05:14:41.690 --> 05:14:41.700 align:start position:0%
payment or January or April I would
 
05:14:43.970 --> 05:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
probably pay that thousand dollars I got
 
05:14:46.190 --> 05:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
for the tuition I owed in my private
 
05:14:48.410 --> 05:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
school if I had twenty dollars left
 
05:14:50.030 --> 05:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
there again I could use it for a
 
05:14:53.090 --> 05:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
notebook going forward
 
05:14:56.448 --> 05:14:56.458 align:start position:0%
my helper for the question from Balboni
 
05:14:58.490 --> 05:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just another question
 
05:14:59.570 --> 05:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
05:15:01.368 --> 05:15:01.378 align:start position:0%
just because I don't really understand
 
05:15:04.250 --> 05:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
the way the program works and I'm new
 
05:15:06.350 --> 05:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
and so I apologize if everyone else
 
05:15:08.150 --> 05:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
knows this but can you please explain to
 
05:15:10.788 --> 05:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
me you're talking about a digital wallet
 
05:15:13.190 --> 05:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
where money is deposited and can move
 
05:15:14.628 --> 05:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
strong but then again you're also
 
05:15:17.750 --> 05:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
talking about being reimbursed yes okay
 
05:15:19.788 --> 05:15:19.798 align:start position:0%
so can you explain the difference we
 
05:15:21.050 --> 05:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
have time for this
 
05:15:23.150 --> 05:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry okay great
 
05:15:26.390 --> 05:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
so technology exists now
 
05:15:28.970 --> 05:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
where there's a platform
 
05:15:32.270 --> 05:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
and so it's a digital wallet platform so
 
05:15:34.610 --> 05:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
it's like PayPal kind of meets Amazon to
 
05:15:36.650 --> 05:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
to imagine it in your head
 
05:15:39.708 --> 05:15:39.718 align:start position:0%
so the grant is held in this digital
 
05:15:42.708 --> 05:15:42.718 align:start position:0%
wallet which is a bank on the back end
 
05:15:44.930 --> 05:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
okay and the front end is an interface
 
05:15:46.610 --> 05:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
where you can log in
 
05:15:48.470 --> 05:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
when you log into your digital wallet
 
05:15:50.628 --> 05:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
there's three ways you can use it
 
05:15:53.750 --> 05:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's an integrated shopping platform
 
05:15:56.090 --> 05:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
called The Marketplace which is why when
 
05:15:58.690 --> 05:15:58.700 align:start position:0%
you look at the expense reports you see
 
05:16:02.150 --> 05:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
Amazon and Staples and vendors like that
 
05:16:04.490 --> 05:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
they're integrated into this shopping
 
05:16:08.090 --> 05:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
platform the benefit for for us from an
 
05:16:09.890 --> 05:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
administrative standpoint of families
 
05:16:11.750 --> 05:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
using that shopping platform to buy
 
05:16:14.150 --> 05:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
their notebooks right in the platform is
 
05:16:17.930 --> 05:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
again it's all internal and so we look
 
05:16:20.330 --> 05:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
at it before it goes anywhere so it's as
 
05:16:22.670 --> 05:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
if we have a pre-approval process so a
 
05:16:24.708 --> 05:16:24.718 align:start position:0%
family puts things in the carts we look
 
05:16:26.810 --> 05:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
at the carts look at the skus in the
 
05:16:28.368 --> 05:16:28.378 align:start position:0%
cart and say these things are allowable
 
05:16:31.010 --> 05:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
but say this thing is not allowable we
 
05:16:32.810 --> 05:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
would just say this this cart is not
 
05:16:34.310 --> 05:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
allowable you've got to make a cart
 
05:16:35.930 --> 05:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
that's allowable okay so there's a
 
05:16:37.610 --> 05:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
benefit and then if a family does a
 
05:16:39.470 --> 05:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
return the money goes right back into
 
05:16:42.170 --> 05:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
the EFA in the digital wallet so it's
 
05:16:44.330 --> 05:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
technology exists
 
05:16:47.030 --> 05:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
the second way a family can use this
 
05:16:48.830 --> 05:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
money in the digital wallet is through
 
05:16:50.990 --> 05:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
what they call a direct pay in those
 
05:16:52.550 --> 05:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
reports you had a list of all those
 
05:16:54.948 --> 05:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
vendors and schools
 
05:16:57.288 --> 05:16:57.298 align:start position:0%
so they've been onboarded into the
 
05:16:57.298 --> 05:16:58.430 align:start position:0%
so they've been onboarded into the
platform

05:16:58.430 --> 05:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
platform
 
05:16:59.990 --> 05:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
so you go in and you say I'm going to
 
05:17:02.448 --> 05:17:02.458 align:start position:0%
pay my school you look for your school
 
05:17:05.570 --> 05:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
in the list right in the platform then
 
05:17:07.730 --> 05:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
you're uploading your invoice for the
 
05:17:09.230 --> 05:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
school in the platform again we're
 
05:17:11.330 --> 05:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
looking at the invoice and saying is it
 
05:17:13.550 --> 05:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
is it allowable or not allowable is it a
 
05:17:15.948 --> 05:17:15.958 align:start position:0%
duplicate right is it is it an error is
 
05:17:17.868 --> 05:17:17.878 align:start position:0%
there a mistake on it so that if it
 
05:17:20.270 --> 05:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't work we say no you can't do that
 
05:17:22.250 --> 05:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
if it does work we say yes and then the
 
05:17:24.350 --> 05:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
payment goes directly to the provider
 
05:17:27.470 --> 05:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
through the digital wallet again it can
 
05:17:30.830 --> 05:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
go back in to the digital wallet also if
 
05:17:32.390 --> 05:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
they want to do a return for example
 
05:17:34.190 --> 05:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
which may be why they're amicable to
 
05:17:36.230 --> 05:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
doing that Rick because it's it's easy
 
05:17:38.030 --> 05:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
for them to say okay put this money back
 
05:17:40.550 --> 05:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
in the child's account but again all of
 
05:17:42.590 --> 05:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
that stays inside
 
05:17:44.510 --> 05:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
then there's a third way which is the
 
05:17:47.690 --> 05:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
reimbursement way and in the law it says
 
05:17:49.190 --> 05:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
they can do a reimbursement with a
 
05:17:49.200 --> 05:17:50.448 align:start position:0%
they can do a reimbursement with a
receipt

05:17:50.448 --> 05:17:50.458 align:start position:0%
receipt
 
05:17:53.030 --> 05:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
so you log into the platform you go into
 
05:17:55.250 --> 05:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement section the families
 
05:17:57.050 --> 05:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
actually have linked their bank account
 
05:18:00.170 --> 05:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
on that piece of it they upload a
 
05:18:02.628 --> 05:18:02.638 align:start position:0%
receipt for something so for example we
 
05:18:05.448 --> 05:18:05.458 align:start position:0%
see a receipt from Walmart okay my team
 
05:18:08.810 --> 05:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
Googles the skus on the receipt to make
 
05:18:10.430 --> 05:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
sure they're all allowable if it's
 
05:18:12.288 --> 05:18:12.298 align:start position:0%
allowable and we can see that the family
 
05:18:14.868 --> 05:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
made that out of pocket expense we can
 
05:18:17.330 --> 05:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
say yes and then the platform directly
 
05:18:19.670 --> 05:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
reimburses the parent
 
05:18:21.288 --> 05:18:21.298 align:start position:0%
amazing right I mean it wouldn't be
 
05:18:24.770 --> 05:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:27.170 --> 05:18:27.180 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you
 
05:18:29.570 --> 05:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I want you this is
 
05:18:30.830 --> 05:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
the first time
 
05:18:33.890 --> 05:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
this committee has had a chance to at
 
05:18:35.930 --> 05:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
least get some briefing on how this
 
05:18:37.430 --> 05:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
house thing works so I'm happy to be
 
05:18:38.930 --> 05:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
here representative Myler you know that
 
05:18:41.208 --> 05:18:41.218 align:start position:0%
but but here's here's the question yeah
 
05:18:43.010 --> 05:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
see if I'm correct
 
05:18:46.010 --> 05:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
it sounds like there is not a
 
05:18:46.020 --> 05:18:47.690 align:start position:0%
it sounds like there is not a
disbursement

05:18:47.690 --> 05:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
disbursement
 
05:18:49.788 --> 05:18:49.798 align:start position:0%
for anything
 
05:18:52.970 --> 05:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
without an optimization
 
05:18:55.430 --> 05:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
from uh one of your staff right human
 
05:18:57.890 --> 05:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
eyes are on everything yeah so no
 
05:19:00.890 --> 05:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
nothing gets paid that without some
 
05:19:04.250 --> 05:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
sense of oversight on that
 
05:19:06.470 --> 05:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's correct that's correct Yeah you
 
05:19:08.628 --> 05:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned though the third talk a little
 
05:19:10.610 --> 05:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
bit more about your third category I
 
05:19:12.590 --> 05:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
didn't quite understand how the Third
 
05:19:14.510 --> 05:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
Way the families can use the the
 
05:19:16.368 --> 05:19:16.378 align:start position:0%
reimbursement capabilities of the
 
05:19:19.070 --> 05:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
platform yes yeah so for example you've
 
05:19:20.690 --> 05:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
made a deposit
 
05:19:23.150 --> 05:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
right at your private school to to
 
05:19:23.160 --> 05:19:24.650 align:start position:0%
right at your private school to to
enroll

05:19:24.650 --> 05:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
enroll
 
05:19:26.510 --> 05:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and you've done that
 
05:19:28.730 --> 05:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
um you know before you participate
 
05:19:30.470 --> 05:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
you're like okay I gotta pay their
 
05:19:31.730 --> 05:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
tuition they're asking me for the
 
05:19:34.670 --> 05:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
tuition in July and I don't start school
 
05:19:37.310 --> 05:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
until September and you paid that
 
05:19:39.470 --> 05:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
tuition you could get reimbursed for the
 
05:19:41.930 --> 05:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
tuition that you paid in advance and
 
05:19:44.628 --> 05:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
that's in the law itself also it says
 
05:19:47.330 --> 05:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
either we can reimburse them for that or
 
05:19:49.850 --> 05:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
we could even pay it for them and then
 
05:19:51.948 --> 05:19:51.958 align:start position:0%
put the money back into their education
 
05:19:54.110 --> 05:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
Freedom account so I mean the way the
 
05:19:56.570 --> 05:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
law was written it was so that the
 
05:19:59.270 --> 05:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
families could use that reimbursement
 
05:19:59.280 --> 05:20:01.250 align:start position:0%
families could use that reimbursement
feature

05:20:01.250 --> 05:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
feature
 
05:20:03.110 --> 05:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
again we look at every single one of
 
05:20:04.850 --> 05:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
them those are the hardest to process
 
05:20:06.948 --> 05:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
because you can imagine I mean they're
 
05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
very diverse receipts every receipt
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
looks differently I mean we're Googling
 
05:20:13.550 --> 05:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
skus on the receipt
 
05:20:15.530 --> 05:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
and we've done 30 000 orders through
 
05:20:17.650 --> 05:20:17.660 align:start position:0%
this platform
 
05:20:20.270 --> 05:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
and you have how many staff do you have
 
05:20:22.310 --> 05:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
now it takes about 10 people to run this
 
05:20:23.770 --> 05:20:23.780 align:start position:0%
program okay thank you yeah
 
05:20:27.470 --> 05:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you thank
 
05:20:29.570 --> 05:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
you for that explanation
 
05:20:33.650 --> 05:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
um and my memory may or may not serve me
 
05:20:36.650 --> 05:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
all the time but Arizona was the first
 
05:20:40.010 --> 05:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
program in 2011 and we've heard about
 
05:20:44.208 --> 05:20:44.218 align:start position:0%
fraud and one of the great examples was
 
05:20:46.970 --> 05:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
Arizona and
 
05:20:50.410 --> 05:20:50.420 align:start position:0%
um got hit with some very heavy fraud
 
05:20:53.750 --> 05:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
investigations and charges for the early
 
05:20:56.150 --> 05:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
program but that was because it was a
 
05:20:58.310 --> 05:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
manual system that they were trying to
 
05:21:01.310 --> 05:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
operate am I correct that they have now
 
05:21:04.730 --> 05:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
you moved to the same platform that we
 
05:21:06.770 --> 05:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
are using that's right well they're
 
05:21:10.010 --> 05:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
halfway moved to using um the platform
 
05:21:11.448 --> 05:21:11.458 align:start position:0%
is called class wallet and they're
 
05:21:13.730 --> 05:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
halfway to having everything run through
 
05:21:15.948 --> 05:21:15.958 align:start position:0%
the platform instead of they were using
 
05:21:18.110 --> 05:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
manual reimbursements and having
 
05:21:20.930 --> 05:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
families do expense reports and that
 
05:21:22.550 --> 05:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
just isn't first of all it's not
 
05:21:24.590 --> 05:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
responsive enough to the families I mean
 
05:21:27.288 --> 05:21:27.298 align:start position:0%
the whole point of creating this program
 
05:21:30.470 --> 05:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
is for it to be parent and child Centric
 
05:21:32.890 --> 05:21:32.900 align:start position:0%
right not to be
 
05:21:35.390 --> 05:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
make it difficult for them to use it
 
05:21:37.970 --> 05:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
right and so using the platform makes it
 
05:21:40.490 --> 05:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
so for example in our law it says they
 
05:21:42.490 --> 05:21:42.500 align:start position:0%
have to have access to their real-time
 
05:21:46.010 --> 05:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
balances so that a family can log in and
 
05:21:47.810 --> 05:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
see what I've what they've used their
 
05:21:50.628 --> 05:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
money on their Grant and see how much
 
05:21:53.030 --> 05:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
they have available the only way to do
 
05:21:55.610 --> 05:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
that would be using this technology and
 
05:21:57.890 --> 05:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
so Arizona is moving towards using this
 
05:22:01.128 --> 05:22:01.138 align:start position:0%
technology fully also and again in New
 
05:22:03.650 --> 05:22:03.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are fiscally responsible
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
and so it would make sense that we would
 
05:22:09.410 --> 05:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
choose to design a program that was also
 
05:22:11.868 --> 05:22:11.878 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible
 
05:22:13.670 --> 05:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
05:22:17.150 --> 05:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:19.010 --> 05:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like it would be very
 
05:22:22.310 --> 05:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
difficult to even commit fraud and so I
 
05:22:24.530 --> 05:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
met I just wonder
 
05:22:26.150 --> 05:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
um in the two years it's been around
 
05:22:28.128 --> 05:22:28.138 align:start position:0%
have you or a year and a half it's been
 
05:22:32.510 --> 05:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
around have you discovered any fraud or
 
05:22:34.128 --> 05:22:34.138 align:start position:0%
attempted fraud
 
05:22:36.948 --> 05:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
we asked some families some clarifying
 
05:22:38.208 --> 05:22:38.218 align:start position:0%
questions if we don't understand
 
05:22:40.788 --> 05:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
something there's a lot of times that we
 
05:22:42.350 --> 05:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
look at something and we might not know
 
05:22:44.570 --> 05:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
what it is and so we'll say to them can
 
05:22:46.670 --> 05:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
you explain to us what this is how does
 
05:22:49.310 --> 05:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
it align with your curriculum we did
 
05:22:51.410 --> 05:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
have one family for whom we were
 
05:22:53.510 --> 05:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
questioning their the receipts in
 
05:22:55.788 --> 05:22:55.798 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and we did have to
 
05:22:58.610 --> 05:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
research to to make sure that it was a
 
05:23:00.890 --> 05:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
legitimate provider that existed that
 
05:23:02.750 --> 05:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
they were getting the receipts from they
 
05:23:06.050 --> 05:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
looked a little bit strange to us and so
 
05:23:08.208 --> 05:23:08.218 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make sure that the store
 
05:23:10.010 --> 05:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
actually existed you know in some of the
 
05:23:11.208 --> 05:23:11.218 align:start position:0%
little small towns in New Hampshire
 
05:23:14.208 --> 05:23:14.218 align:start position:0%
there's tiny stores and we wanted to
 
05:23:16.610 --> 05:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
make sure the store existed and so we
 
05:23:18.590 --> 05:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
went to the store we contacted the store
 
05:23:20.090 --> 05:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
and we were like okay this is a real
 
05:23:22.190 --> 05:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
store and they just don't have very good
 
05:23:24.890 --> 05:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
receipts and and so those have been our
 
05:23:27.470 --> 05:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
experiences so far we haven't referred
 
05:23:29.868 --> 05:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
someone to the attorney general but as
 
05:23:31.550 --> 05:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
you've noticed from this discussion we
 
05:23:34.070 --> 05:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
do take this really seriously and would
 
05:23:36.470 --> 05:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
refer someone to the attorney general
 
05:23:39.948 --> 05:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
and freeze their account and reject them
 
05:23:41.930 --> 05:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
from the program if we thought that they
 
05:23:43.788 --> 05:23:43.798 align:start position:0%
were because they'd be taking advantage
 
05:23:45.110 --> 05:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
of us as much as they've been taking
 
05:23:47.390 --> 05:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
advantage of the taxpayer and that's
 
05:23:50.208 --> 05:23:50.218 align:start position:0%
unacceptable to us so we would do it but
 
05:23:52.970 --> 05:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
we haven't had to do that okay we're in
 
05:23:54.650 --> 05:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
technical questions if somebody has a
 
05:23:56.930 --> 05:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
technical question to ask of Kate
 
05:23:58.670 --> 05:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
um let's go for it but we're I want to
 
05:24:01.670 --> 05:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
close this thing down by 2 30. one more
 
05:24:04.070 --> 05:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
here thank you
 
05:24:07.070 --> 05:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
um I'd love to get outlines uh oh come
 
05:24:08.810 --> 05:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
on you're having fun
 
05:24:11.150 --> 05:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
um 28 to 30.
 
05:24:13.910 --> 05:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
um talks about investigation sure um the
 
05:24:17.330 --> 05:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
example you just gave of um contacting
 
05:24:19.670 --> 05:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
that little store about the receipt and
 
05:24:21.170 --> 05:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
so forth yeah
 
05:24:23.750 --> 05:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
um I would think that that would be an
 
05:24:27.170 --> 05:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
example of an investigation you're doing
 
05:24:29.690 --> 05:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there is no fraud
 
05:24:31.850 --> 05:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
involved yeah and that part is crossed
 
05:24:33.530 --> 05:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
out in this bill I mean there's four
 
05:24:35.750 --> 05:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
pages of of the parent handbook that
 
05:24:38.030 --> 05:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
pertain to this and I don't have them
 
05:24:40.550 --> 05:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
all memorized so I can't tell you all of
 
05:24:44.090 --> 05:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
the steps that we go through but because
 
05:24:45.890 --> 05:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
that was such a big piece of the law
 
05:24:48.530 --> 05:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
it's a big piece of the rules also we do
 
05:24:51.948 --> 05:24:51.958 align:start position:0%
have a whole process and and Matt isn't
 
05:24:53.510 --> 05:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
here but Matt would be the one to lead
 
05:24:55.670 --> 05:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
that process in his role as director of
 
05:24:56.930 --> 05:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
policy and compliance in our
 
05:24:56.940 --> 05:24:58.368 align:start position:0%
policy and compliance in our
organization

05:24:58.368 --> 05:24:58.378 align:start position:0%
organization
 
05:25:00.110 --> 05:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
and thank you it's laid out in the
 
05:25:01.250 --> 05:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
parent handbook if you do want to read
 
05:25:02.510 --> 05:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
it okay this is going to be the last
 
05:25:05.150 --> 05:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
question folks represent Balboni
 
05:25:07.310 --> 05:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:25:08.750 --> 05:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
um just one last question again being
 
05:25:11.330 --> 05:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
new to the whole program what there's a
 
05:25:13.970 --> 05:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
lot of talk about the 10 and so there's
 
05:25:16.670 --> 05:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
two questions regarding the ten percent
 
05:25:20.510 --> 05:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
um one is is the 10 above the adequacy
 
05:25:22.970 --> 05:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
amount that you get and the second
 
05:25:25.070 --> 05:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
question is there's been some talk about
 
05:25:28.010 --> 05:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
how as the program gets more efficient
 
05:25:31.970 --> 05:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
that 10 cost May decrease so can you
 
05:25:35.090 --> 05:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
speak to that sure yeah absolutely so
 
05:25:38.448 --> 05:25:38.458 align:start position:0%
what it says in the law is up to 10 and
 
05:25:40.850 --> 05:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
yes from the from the adequacy so it's
 
05:25:43.910 --> 05:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
not above the adequacy so say a family
 
05:25:45.708 --> 05:25:45.718 align:start position:0%
gets a grant of
 
05:25:48.288 --> 05:25:48.298 align:start position:0%
four thousand dollars right the amount
 
05:25:50.208 --> 05:25:50.218 align:start position:0%
that we could use for administrative
 
05:25:54.470 --> 05:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
costs is four hundred dollars and the
 
05:25:56.628 --> 05:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
family would get the grant of how's my
 
05:25:59.510 --> 05:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
math thirty six hundred dollars okay so
 
05:26:01.788 --> 05:26:01.798 align:start position:0%
when the family receives the grant the
 
05:26:03.708 --> 05:26:03.718 align:start position:0%
cost of getting that Grant to them and
 
05:26:05.570 --> 05:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
all the technology and the people is is
 
05:26:08.930 --> 05:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
not there already and yes it's up to ten
 
05:26:12.170 --> 05:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
percent so last year even with all the
 
05:26:16.910 --> 05:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
startup costs we were at 9.8 and yes Our
 
05:26:19.250 --> 05:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
intention is to run it for as little as
 
05:26:21.410 --> 05:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
possible administrative costs so be
 
05:26:23.090 --> 05:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
great if we could get down to five or
 
05:26:26.270 --> 05:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
six the digital wallet platform we have
 
05:26:28.368 --> 05:26:28.378 align:start position:0%
to pay for that is a big part of the
 
05:26:31.310 --> 05:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
total cost of the program because while
 
05:26:31.320 --> 05:26:32.110 align:start position:0%
total cost of the program because while
it's

05:26:32.110 --> 05:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:26:35.628 --> 05:26:35.638 align:start position:0%
fabulous it's not inexpensive
 
05:26:37.850 --> 05:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
and so we're already running if you take
 
05:26:40.430 --> 05:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
your 10 you divide it up between the
 
05:26:42.350 --> 05:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
cost of my humans and the work that
 
05:26:44.628 --> 05:26:44.638 align:start position:0%
they're doing and the digital wallet you
 
05:26:46.070 --> 05:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
know we're running closer to seven or
 
05:26:48.530 --> 05:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
eight already because two or three is
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
the digital wallet cost
 
05:26:52.910 --> 05:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
okay if there are any other questions
 
05:26:55.610 --> 05:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
for representative cordelli ask them a
 
05:26:58.128 --> 05:26:58.138 align:start position:0%

05:33:05.510 --> 05:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:33:08.208 --> 05:33:08.218 align:start position:0%
House Bill 538 is relative to public
 
05:33:10.070 --> 05:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
education and before we can discuss
 
05:33:11.448 --> 05:33:11.458 align:start position:0%
public education we should understand
 
05:33:14.570 --> 05:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
clearly what public education is public
 
05:33:16.788 --> 05:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire means that
 
05:33:18.830 --> 05:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
each local community has an obligation
 
05:33:20.390 --> 05:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
to educate the children of their
 
05:33:20.400 --> 05:33:21.410 align:start position:0%
to educate the children of their
community

05:33:21.410 --> 05:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:33:23.750 --> 05:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
inherent in this responsibility is the
 
05:33:26.030 --> 05:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
Public Funding for the education of all
 
05:33:27.830 --> 05:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
local children
 
05:33:30.050 --> 05:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
so when we speak of public education we
 
05:33:32.030 --> 05:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
are speaking of who is responsible for
 
05:33:35.090 --> 05:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
financing that education that's why
 
05:33:37.490 --> 05:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
today that is what today's discussion is
 
05:33:41.270 --> 05:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
about it's not about uh how or where our
 
05:33:43.010 --> 05:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
community will provide that education
 
05:33:46.190 --> 05:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
but rather how they will fund it should
 
05:33:47.930 --> 05:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
not be a discussion about this school or
 
05:33:49.368 --> 05:33:49.378 align:start position:0%
that school or this method or that
 
05:33:51.110 --> 05:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
method those those are those things are
 
05:33:53.448 --> 05:33:53.458 align:start position:0%
a separate conversation
 
05:33:55.670 --> 05:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
before we get to the particulars uh
 
05:33:57.288 --> 05:33:57.298 align:start position:0%
particular details of this bill I want
 
05:33:59.868 --> 05:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
you to consider the following
 
05:34:03.590 --> 05:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
there are no public schools in New
 
05:34:03.600 --> 05:34:04.788 align:start position:0%
there are no public schools in New
Hampshire

05:34:04.788 --> 05:34:04.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:34:06.410 --> 05:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
05:34:08.330 --> 05:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
there are no public schools in New
 
05:34:10.490 --> 05:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what we have is a large number
 
05:34:12.708 --> 05:34:12.718 align:start position:0%
of private schools that have been
 
05:34:14.510 --> 05:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
granted unilateral claim to public
 
05:34:17.690 --> 05:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
education monies let us consider my
 
05:34:19.610 --> 05:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
hometown at Deerfield as a case in point
 
05:34:21.890 --> 05:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
the Deerfield Community School our local
 
05:34:24.050 --> 05:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
public school is not really a public
 
05:34:26.270 --> 05:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
school it is not available to the
 
05:34:27.530 --> 05:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
General Public
 
05:34:30.288 --> 05:34:30.298 align:start position:0%
it is in fact a private school for
 
05:34:32.090 --> 05:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
Deerfield children
 
05:34:34.250 --> 05:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
if your child does not reside in
 
05:34:36.170 --> 05:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
Deerfield it is all but impossible for
 
05:34:37.788 --> 05:34:37.798 align:start position:0%
your child to attend the Deerfield
 
05:34:39.470 --> 05:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
Community School
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
Deerfield is a small school district so
 
05:34:43.610 --> 05:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
it would not be completely unfair to
 
05:34:44.930 --> 05:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
suggest that it does not provide
 
05:34:46.250 --> 05:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
sufficient evidence of the previous
 
05:34:49.010 --> 05:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
claim fair enough let us consider larger
 
05:34:50.690 --> 05:34:50.700 align:start position:0%
public school districts such as Concord
 
05:34:53.330 --> 05:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
Manchester Nashua Etc many districts
 
05:34:55.910 --> 05:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
have more than one and often several
 
05:34:58.550 --> 05:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
schools that teach the same grade within
 
05:35:00.530 --> 05:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
their Community boundaries
 
05:35:02.990 --> 05:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
both these school but these schools each
 
05:35:05.030 --> 05:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
providing an education for children of
 
05:35:07.010 --> 05:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
the same grade level are not freely
 
05:35:09.830 --> 05:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
available to all the children in that
 
05:35:12.050 --> 05:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
Community currently in those grades
 
05:35:14.868 --> 05:35:14.878 align:start position:0%
children must attend the school in their
 
05:35:17.330 --> 05:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
District assigned to them based on the
 
05:35:19.730 --> 05:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
child's home address those schools are
 
05:35:21.350 --> 05:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
not Public Schools those schools are
 
05:35:22.910 --> 05:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
private schools for students living
 
05:35:25.190 --> 05:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
within a very specific and limited
 
05:35:27.288 --> 05:35:27.298 align:start position:0%
geographical area
 
05:35:29.570 --> 05:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
this is an important notion to keep in
 
05:35:31.788 --> 05:35:31.798 align:start position:0%
mind current and modern thinking on
 
05:35:34.070 --> 05:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
education is to provide that which is in
 
05:35:36.948 --> 05:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the student
 
05:35:39.288 --> 05:35:39.298 align:start position:0%
and I agree with that it is hard to
 
05:35:41.390 --> 05:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
imagine that requiring attendance at a
 
05:35:42.948 --> 05:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
particular School based on a student's
 
05:35:45.530 --> 05:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
address will provide students with the
 
05:35:47.750 --> 05:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
education that meets their particular
 
05:35:50.690 --> 05:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
and individual best interests
 
05:35:52.730 --> 05:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
it's also interesting to consider
 
05:35:54.590 --> 05:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
special education in this discussion
 
05:35:56.690 --> 05:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
children in the special education system
 
05:35:59.270 --> 05:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
each receive an IEP and individualized
 
05:36:01.190 --> 05:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
education plan to ensure the child
 
05:36:02.930 --> 05:36:02.940 align:start position:0%
receives an individualized education
 
05:36:05.330 --> 05:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
that is in the best interest of the
 
05:36:07.850 --> 05:36:07.860 align:start position:0%
student further those requiring the most
 
05:36:10.310 --> 05:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
specialized individual education plan
 
05:36:13.208 --> 05:36:13.218 align:start position:0%
are often sent to or tuitioned into
 
05:36:16.070 --> 05:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
private schools most of which are out of
 
05:36:18.770 --> 05:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
District that are capable of providing
 
05:36:21.530 --> 05:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
for the needs that that student that are
 
05:36:23.750 --> 05:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
in that student's best interest
 
05:36:26.208 --> 05:36:26.218 align:start position:0%
so the concept and practice of using
 
05:36:28.190 --> 05:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
local taxpayer education Monies to send
 
05:36:30.050 --> 05:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
students to private institutions for a
 
05:36:32.448 --> 05:36:32.458 align:start position:0%
public education is already in common
 
05:36:32.458 --> 05:36:34.610 align:start position:0%
public education is already in common
practice

05:36:34.610 --> 05:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
practice
 
05:36:37.250 --> 05:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
in fact my hometown of Deerfield is a
 
05:36:39.230 --> 05:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
public school for pre-k through grade
 
05:36:39.240 --> 05:36:40.368 align:start position:0%
public school for pre-k through grade
eight

05:36:40.368 --> 05:36:40.378 align:start position:0%
eight
 
05:36:42.770 --> 05:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
we do not have a high school
 
05:36:45.288 --> 05:36:45.298 align:start position:0%
there's a high school in our SAU but
 
05:36:46.850 --> 05:36:46.860 align:start position:0%
Deerfield the Deerfield School District
 
05:36:49.550 --> 05:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
currently does not send any students
 
05:36:53.208 --> 05:36:53.218 align:start position:0%
there we tuition all of our students to
 
05:36:54.830 --> 05:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
Heist all of our high school students
 
05:36:57.410 --> 05:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
out of district and out of our SAU
 
05:37:00.170 --> 05:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
primarily Concord Concord is uh is where
 
05:37:01.670 --> 05:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
we send the vast majority of our
 
05:37:03.708 --> 05:37:03.718 align:start position:0%
students and a few attend other schools
 
05:37:06.470 --> 05:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
so school choice is nothing new what
 
05:37:08.810 --> 05:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
we're about to just discuss is crew
 
05:37:11.208 --> 05:37:11.218 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to make the decision
 
05:37:13.970 --> 05:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
who should get to make the choice for a
 
05:37:15.708 --> 05:37:15.718 align:start position:0%
particular student that is what I hope
 
05:37:17.390 --> 05:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
we'll be discussing today
 
05:37:20.090 --> 05:37:20.100 align:start position:0%
House Bill 538 enact establishing local
 
05:37:22.010 --> 05:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program is
 
05:37:24.170 --> 05:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation
 
05:37:27.050 --> 05:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we value we treasure
 
05:37:29.330 --> 05:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
local control and we have a long history
 
05:37:31.368 --> 05:37:31.378 align:start position:0%
of supporting legislation that grants
 
05:37:33.590 --> 05:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
our communities local control local
 
05:37:35.510 --> 05:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
decision making
 
05:37:38.330 --> 05:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
this bill grants vocal control to decide
 
05:37:40.970 --> 05:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
if local education monies should be
 
05:37:43.010 --> 05:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
allowed to follow the child
 
05:37:44.990 --> 05:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
the mechanisms contained within this
 
05:37:47.628 --> 05:37:47.638 align:start position:0%
bill already exist and can be found in
 
05:37:51.050 --> 05:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
existing rsas first the question is
 
05:37:53.330 --> 05:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
defined in the bill shall we adopt the
 
05:37:56.570 --> 05:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
provisions of RSA 194g to allow the
 
05:37:58.550 --> 05:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
establishment of local education Freedom
 
05:38:00.590 --> 05:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
account program and insert your local
 
05:38:02.868 --> 05:38:02.878 align:start position:0%
District this ensures that the question
 
05:38:04.788 --> 05:38:04.798 align:start position:0%
is stated clearly and concisely and
 
05:38:06.708 --> 05:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
cannot be altered for any reason that
 
05:38:08.330 --> 05:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
way the voters know what they're voting
 
05:38:08.340 --> 05:38:09.170 align:start position:0%
way the voters know what they're voting
on

05:38:09.170 --> 05:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:38:11.448 --> 05:38:11.458 align:start position:0%
the real the repeal language is also
 
05:38:13.128 --> 05:38:13.138 align:start position:0%
defined in the bill and it asks that the
 
05:38:15.470 --> 05:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
question in the in the opposite
 
05:38:17.690 --> 05:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
the enactment
 
05:38:20.990 --> 05:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
the repeal requires a three-fifths a
 
05:38:23.868 --> 05:38:23.878 align:start position:0%
sixty percent vote in the affirmative by
 
05:38:25.970 --> 05:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
local voters
 
05:38:28.128 --> 05:38:28.138 align:start position:0%
that is the local voters will get to
 
05:38:30.050 --> 05:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not this is what they
 
05:38:32.208 --> 05:38:32.218 align:start position:0%
want to do in their school district
 
05:38:34.430 --> 05:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
this sets a reasonable threshold for a
 
05:38:36.288 --> 05:38:36.298 align:start position:0%
community to make this decision and it
 
05:38:37.730 --> 05:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
is a threshold that is used in other
 
05:38:39.590 --> 05:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
existing ballot messages such as going
 
05:38:41.628 --> 05:38:41.638 align:start position:0%
from traditional town meeting to sb2 or
 
05:38:43.550 --> 05:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
back from sb2 back to traditional town
 
05:38:46.070 --> 05:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
meeting okay
 
05:38:47.930 --> 05:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
the threshold to place the question on
 
05:38:50.270 --> 05:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
the ballot is low buy and this by Design
 
05:38:52.610 --> 05:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
to ensure easy access to enable local
 
05:38:54.830 --> 05:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
control again these thresholds already
 
05:38:57.530 --> 05:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
exist in other statutes and there is no
 
05:38:59.270 --> 05:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
value in setting an artificially High
 
05:39:02.570 --> 05:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
barrier to access uh to ask a clear and
 
05:39:04.490 --> 05:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
succinct question to discern the will of
 
05:39:06.890 --> 05:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
the people in such a matter
 
05:39:10.368 --> 05:39:10.378 align:start position:0%
the computation of local education funds
 
05:39:11.990 --> 05:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
this is where we're going to depart from
 
05:39:14.690 --> 05:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
what we discussed uh previously in the
 
05:39:16.850 --> 05:39:16.860 align:start position:0%
last session we talked about this the
 
05:39:18.708 --> 05:39:18.718 align:start position:0%
local education Freedom account shall be
 
05:39:21.050 --> 05:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
funded by The Local District at an
 
05:39:23.690 --> 05:39:23.700 align:start position:0%
original amount equal to twice the per
 
05:39:26.690 --> 05:39:26.700 align:start position:0%
pupil adequate education grant amount
 
05:39:31.250 --> 05:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
under RSA 198 colon 40-a plus any
 
05:39:32.930 --> 05:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid that would have been
 
05:39:34.970 --> 05:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
provided to a public school for that
 
05:39:36.770 --> 05:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
eligible student
 
05:39:39.170 --> 05:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
it's estimated that the state adequacy
 
05:39:41.868 --> 05:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
Grant funds approximately 20 percent of
 
05:39:44.030 --> 05:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
a public education in the average school
 
05:39:46.010 --> 05:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
district in New Hampshire so this
 
05:39:48.890 --> 05:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
program would make 40 percent of that
 
05:39:50.810 --> 05:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
money available to follow the child
 
05:39:54.530 --> 05:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
leaving 60 percent of the money in the
 
05:39:56.628 --> 05:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
local school district
 
05:39:56.638 --> 05:39:57.590 align:start position:0%
local school district
state

05:39:57.590 --> 05:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:40:00.110 --> 05:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
adequacy Grant is currently and I had to
 
05:40:02.090 --> 05:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
revise my notes a little bit currently
 
05:40:03.770 --> 05:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
about forty eight hundred dollars per
 
05:40:05.930 --> 05:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
student so thank you Mr Speaker for
 
05:40:07.150 --> 05:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
staying back
 
05:40:10.550 --> 05:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
thus making uh about ninety six hundred
 
05:40:12.590 --> 05:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
dollars available to follow the student
 
05:40:14.930 --> 05:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
this is enough money to allow virtually
 
05:40:17.628 --> 05:40:17.638 align:start position:0%
any New Hampshire family to select the
 
05:40:19.550 --> 05:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities that they
 
05:40:21.110 --> 05:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
believe in the best is in the best
 
05:40:22.788 --> 05:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
interest of their children
 
05:40:25.490 --> 05:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
this program would be a fiscal win-win
 
05:40:28.430 --> 05:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
for both students families and local
 
05:40:30.948 --> 05:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
05:40:33.110 --> 05:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
a student enrolled in this program is
 
05:40:34.910 --> 05:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
counted in the average daily membership
 
05:40:37.610 --> 05:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
and attendance calculation and therefore
 
05:40:39.708 --> 05:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
All State monies associated with that
 
05:40:41.750 --> 05:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
child continue to flow to the local
 
05:40:44.570 --> 05:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
school district this also means that the
 
05:40:47.270 --> 05:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
state and local EFA programs are
 
05:40:50.330 --> 05:40:50.340 align:start position:0%
mutually exclusive a student could not
 
05:40:53.330 --> 05:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
participate in both
 
05:40:56.510 --> 05:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
okay special education monies are left
 
05:40:59.930 --> 05:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
entirely intact and untouched Federal
 
05:41:04.250 --> 05:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
monies are left intact and untouched
 
05:41:06.410 --> 05:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
large part of the discussion on hb20
 
05:41:09.350 --> 05:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
which is our current EFA uh bill was the
 
05:41:11.390 --> 05:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
grant would not be sufficient to allow
 
05:41:13.430 --> 05:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
lower income earners to access other
 
05:41:16.730 --> 05:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
educational options well I would posit
 
05:41:18.530 --> 05:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
that every little bit helps to be sure
 
05:41:21.948 --> 05:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
this bill directly addresses that issue
 
05:41:24.410 --> 05:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
and provided Grant sufficient to allow
 
05:41:26.868 --> 05:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
even the most economically challenged

families to access a very broad spectrum
 
05:41:33.110 --> 05:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
of alternative opportunities
 
05:41:35.090 --> 05:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
that being said it would be a shame if
 
05:41:37.430 --> 05:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
the debate on this bill devolved into a
 
05:41:39.650 --> 05:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
discussion of class conflict public
 
05:41:42.230 --> 05:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
education is providing the funding for
 
05:41:44.090 --> 05:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
the education of all children in the
 
05:41:47.330 --> 05:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
community using public resources all
 
05:41:49.250 --> 05:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
children should have the same and equal
 
05:41:52.430 --> 05:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
right to lay claim to an equal share of
 
05:41:54.470 --> 05:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
the publicly raised regular education
 
05:41:57.170 --> 05:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
funds regardless of the family's
 
05:41:59.208 --> 05:41:59.218 align:start position:0%
financial status
 
05:42:02.570 --> 05:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
after all we don't charge rich kids more
 
05:42:05.208 --> 05:42:05.218 align:start position:0%
money to attend the local public school
 
05:42:07.788 --> 05:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
if a community chooses to allow local
 
05:42:10.250 --> 05:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
education Monies to follow the child why
 
05:42:12.948 --> 05:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
would we alter that equal access social
 
05:42:12.958 --> 05:42:15.050 align:start position:0%
would we alter that equal access social
contract

05:42:15.050 --> 05:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
contract
 
05:42:16.368 --> 05:42:16.378 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of discussion
 
05:42:18.770 --> 05:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
relative to the expected effects of
 
05:42:20.690 --> 05:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
school choice on local school districts
 
05:42:22.910 --> 05:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
let us consider some facts I believe
 
05:42:25.310 --> 05:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
that most families prefer that their
 
05:42:27.288 --> 05:42:27.298 align:start position:0%
children attend the local school
 
05:42:27.298 --> 05:42:28.550 align:start position:0%
children attend the local school
district

05:42:28.550 --> 05:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
district
 
05:42:30.288 --> 05:42:30.298 align:start position:0%
I believe this to be true for a few
 
05:42:33.110 --> 05:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
reasons first and foremost most families
 
05:42:35.510 --> 05:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
want their children to be raised with a
 
05:42:38.030 --> 05:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
sense of community and for their
 
05:42:40.128 --> 05:42:40.138 align:start position:0%
children to be connected to that
 
05:42:42.410 --> 05:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
Community most families want their
 
05:42:44.810 --> 05:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
children to know their neighbors and the
 
05:42:46.490 --> 05:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
local school The Local District school
 
05:42:48.288 --> 05:42:48.298 align:start position:0%
is often the most efficient way of
 
05:42:50.270 --> 05:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
achieving this goal
 
05:42:53.030 --> 05:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
that is a reason most families want
 
05:42:54.948 --> 05:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
their children to attend local school
 
05:42:54.958 --> 05:42:56.690 align:start position:0%
their children to attend local school
districts

05:42:56.690 --> 05:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
districts
 
05:42:58.670 --> 05:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
is transportation
 
05:43:00.650 --> 05:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we require district
 
05:43:01.910 --> 05:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
schools to provide student
 
05:43:03.770 --> 05:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
transportation to and from the local
 
05:43:07.550 --> 05:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
District school through grade 8. this is
 
05:43:09.650 --> 05:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
not an insignificant benefit for most
 
05:43:11.810 --> 05:43:11.820 align:start position:0%
families for attending their local
 
05:43:14.270 --> 05:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
District school a family that chooses to
 
05:43:15.948 --> 05:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
leave the local school district for
 
05:43:18.470 --> 05:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
whatever reason independently and under
 
05:43:21.288 --> 05:43:21.298 align:start position:0%
this program would lose the benefit of
 
05:43:23.690 --> 05:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
free transportation for the sake of
 
05:43:25.610 --> 05:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
brevity lastly most families believe
 
05:43:27.170 --> 05:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
that their local school district
 
05:43:29.330 --> 05:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
provides a good education for their
 
05:43:31.430 --> 05:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
children why would a family choose to
 
05:43:33.590 --> 05:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
leave a local school district if their
 
05:43:35.750 --> 05:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
needs are already being met so for those
 
05:43:37.610 --> 05:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
that say this would cause a mass Exodus
 
05:43:39.230 --> 05:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
out of the local public schools I would
 
05:43:41.090 --> 05:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
say that that that that that simply
 
05:43:43.310 --> 05:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
should not be the case and if it is
 
05:43:44.930 --> 05:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
while the school district should think
 
05:43:46.610 --> 05:43:46.620 align:start position:0%
about why that is
 
05:43:49.610 --> 05:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
fact of the matter is no school no one
 
05:43:51.170 --> 05:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
school can provide what is in the best
 
05:43:52.910 --> 05:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
interest of every student in the
 
05:43:56.150 --> 05:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
district there is no one-size-fits-all
 
05:43:58.070 --> 05:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
so for some students an alternative
 
05:43:59.868 --> 05:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity is in the best interest of
 
05:44:01.970 --> 05:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
the student and we should always strive
 
05:44:04.310 --> 05:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
for what is in the best interest of the
 
05:44:04.320 --> 05:44:06.350 align:start position:0%
for what is in the best interest of the
student

05:44:06.350 --> 05:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
student
 
05:44:07.610 --> 05:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has some of the best
 
05:44:09.470 --> 05:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
public schools in the country
 
05:44:11.868 --> 05:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
nobody refutes that fact
 
05:44:14.990 --> 05:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
but going back to 2008 and looking at
 
05:44:16.730 --> 05:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
kneecap smarter balance and New
 
05:44:18.350 --> 05:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire SAS New Hampshire Public
 
05:44:21.170 --> 05:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
School students as a group rarely break
 
05:44:24.708 --> 05:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
50 percent at or above Proficiency in
 
05:44:26.650 --> 05:44:26.660 align:start position:0%
English language arts
 
05:44:30.530 --> 05:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
mathematics or science this is also a
 
05:44:34.190 --> 05:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
fact a stark and stunning fact so while
 
05:44:35.390 --> 05:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
we may have some of the best public
 
05:44:37.368 --> 05:44:37.378 align:start position:0%
schools in the nation we are still on
 
05:44:39.350 --> 05:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
average missing the mark for half of our
 
05:44:39.360 --> 05:44:41.030 align:start position:0%
average missing the mark for half of our
students

05:44:41.030 --> 05:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:44:44.270 --> 05:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
this bill requires to provide an annual
 
05:44:46.490 --> 05:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
record of educational attainment by
 
05:44:48.410 --> 05:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
having the student take the Statewide
 
05:44:52.690 --> 05:44:52.700 align:start position:0%
student assessment test pursuant to RSA
 
05:44:56.030 --> 05:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
193-6 C colon six so the previous
 
05:44:58.368 --> 05:44:58.378 align:start position:0%
version of this Bill had multiple
 
05:45:01.368 --> 05:45:01.378 align:start position:0%
versions to show academic attainment and
 
05:45:02.930 --> 05:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
that was one of the criticisms from the
 
05:45:04.430 --> 05:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
other side of the aisle on the previous
 
05:45:06.830 --> 05:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
version of the bill and I took that
 
05:45:09.830 --> 05:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
criticism to heart and so this bill has
 
05:45:12.890 --> 05:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
simply the Statewide assessment as the
 
05:45:14.570 --> 05:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
vehicle just like we do for public
 
05:45:14.580 --> 05:45:15.708 align:start position:0%
vehicle just like we do for public
schools

05:45:15.708 --> 05:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:45:18.410 --> 05:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
okay so that's it's the same assessment
 
05:45:20.270 --> 05:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle if you want to participate in a
 
05:45:22.128 --> 05:45:22.138 align:start position:0%
local EFA that's what you do
 
05:45:23.750 --> 05:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's interesting to know once you enter
 
05:45:26.030 --> 05:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education in America then
 
05:45:28.250 --> 05:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
we transition to 100 school choice
 
05:45:31.128 --> 05:45:31.138 align:start position:0%
environment and look how good that
 
05:45:33.650 --> 05:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
system works the diversity in schools
 
05:45:35.930 --> 05:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
and programs is all but unparalleled and
 
05:45:37.510 --> 05:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
meets the needs of almost all
 
05:45:40.070 --> 05:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
interestingly we do not try to block
 
05:45:41.930 --> 05:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money in the form of Pell
 
05:45:44.270 --> 05:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
Grants and student loans or other
 
05:45:46.070 --> 05:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
financial assistance from flowing to
 
05:45:47.810 --> 05:45:47.820 align:start position:0%
private colleges or universities to
 
05:45:49.670 --> 05:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
religious colleges or and universities
 
05:45:52.190 --> 05:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
this program is a little different than
 
05:45:54.890 --> 05:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
that with respect to where we allow tax
 
05:45:58.868 --> 05:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:01.070 --> 05:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
the allegation that there will be an
 
05:46:02.570 --> 05:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
exodus of students from the local school
 
05:46:05.270 --> 05:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
district to other opportunities is not
 
05:46:08.390 --> 05:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
really a possibility at least not in the
 
05:46:09.530 --> 05:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
near future
 
05:46:11.628 --> 05:46:11.638 align:start position:0%
right so why is that the reason for that
 
05:46:13.730 --> 05:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
is simple there's really no available
 
05:46:16.610 --> 05:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
slots in any non-public school in New
 
05:46:18.350 --> 05:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there might be a few but there
 
05:46:20.090 --> 05:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
aren't many they have all been taken
 
05:46:21.890 --> 05:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
during the last several years as parents
 
05:46:23.690 --> 05:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
seek out other options to best fit their
 
05:46:26.270 --> 05:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
needs with respect to responses to covet
 
05:46:26.280 --> 05:46:27.530 align:start position:0%
needs with respect to responses to covet
19.

05:46:27.530 --> 05:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
19.
 
05:46:31.010 --> 05:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
so the available uh inventory is very
 
05:46:32.990 --> 05:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
very limited except for homeschooling
 
05:46:35.330 --> 05:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
which is essentially unlimited which is
 
05:46:37.310 --> 05:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
an option but it's not an option that
 
05:46:39.048 --> 05:46:39.058 align:start position:0%
that works for the vast majority of
 
05:46:42.470 --> 05:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
families it just doesn't so it's not
 
05:46:43.910 --> 05:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to expect that the
 
05:46:45.470 --> 05:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
inventory of available slots in
 
05:46:47.330 --> 05:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
education settings will increase to meet
 
05:46:49.310 --> 05:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
the demand but that process will take
 
05:46:51.770 --> 05:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
time Market forces are wonderful things
 
05:46:54.650 --> 05:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
to determine customer customer demands
 
05:46:57.350 --> 05:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
if a district if a district school sees
 
05:46:59.990 --> 05:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
it as losing students for to other
 
05:47:02.390 --> 05:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
educational settings then that's an
 
05:47:04.010 --> 05:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
indication that they have not provided
 
05:47:06.170 --> 05:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
the product the service they're
 
05:47:08.030 --> 05:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
customer-based desires and that would be
 
05:47:09.890 --> 05:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
the students
 
05:47:11.868 --> 05:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
if this occurs then the district school
 
05:47:13.670 --> 05:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
has one of two options stay the course
 
05:47:14.990 --> 05:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
and lose more and more of their
 
05:47:17.150 --> 05:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
customers to the competition or retool
 
05:47:19.310 --> 05:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
and provide the product the service that
 
05:47:21.890 --> 05:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
their customer base desires this is the
 
05:47:23.810 --> 05:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
critical feedback loop that is currently
 
05:47:25.788 --> 05:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
missing from our public education system
 
05:47:28.070 --> 05:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
because we have continued to winnow our
 
05:47:32.810 --> 05:47:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:32.820 --> 05:47:35.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:47:35.150 --> 05:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:47:37.010 --> 05:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
because it's late in the day I'll I'll
 
05:47:39.170 --> 05:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
sort of cut part of it short but the
 
05:47:41.690 --> 05:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
American public education system is a
 
05:47:44.810 --> 05:47:44.820 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing to be sure but American
 
05:47:46.910 --> 05:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
public education is and should continue
 
05:47:48.890 --> 05:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
to be a lot more than just a local
 
05:47:50.150 --> 05:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
public school
 
05:47:52.070 --> 05:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
let us do what's in the best interest in
 
05:47:53.510 --> 05:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire children New Hampshire
 
05:47:55.670 --> 05:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
students and not confine ourselves to
 
05:47:56.990 --> 05:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
what is in the best interest of a
 
05:47:58.548 --> 05:47:58.558 align:start position:0%
particular institution or a building
 
05:48:01.190 --> 05:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
public education is after all the Public
 
05:48:03.170 --> 05:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
Funding of the education of our children
 
05:48:05.330 --> 05:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
Mr chair Mr chairman and members of the
 
05:48:06.770 --> 05:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
committee I thank you for your time and
 
05:48:08.510 --> 05:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
consideration and I would be happy to
 
05:48:10.730 --> 05:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you very much
 
05:48:13.190 --> 05:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative I got one question for
 
05:48:15.890 --> 05:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
you if a student receives one of your
 
05:48:18.590 --> 05:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
local efas here can they also apply for
 
05:48:21.708 --> 05:48:21.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:24.048 --> 05:48:24.058 align:start position:0%
they can do it with the other EFA
 
05:48:27.048 --> 05:48:27.058 align:start position:0%
program you can the education tax credit
 
05:48:29.570 --> 05:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
is one where we the money you know where
 
05:48:32.990 --> 05:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
that comes from yes I I do I I believe
 
05:48:35.930 --> 05:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes I I would honestly I
 
05:48:37.788 --> 05:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
would have to double check so the way
 
05:48:40.970 --> 05:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
that this bill is written is it largely
 
05:48:43.670 --> 05:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
mirrors uh the mechanics of our current
 
05:48:46.670 --> 05:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
EFA program so this this bill doesn't
 
05:48:49.548 --> 05:48:49.558 align:start position:0%
look to recreate the wheel as to how an
 
05:48:53.690 --> 05:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
EFA works this bill is simply making
 
05:48:56.390 --> 05:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
um a potential availability of local
 
05:48:59.270 --> 05:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
funds to be able to follow the student
 
05:49:01.670 --> 05:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you can do it I would say
 
05:49:03.770 --> 05:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
I would say yes and if I find out I'm in
 
05:49:05.868 --> 05:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
Heir I'd be more than happy thank you to
 
05:49:08.330 --> 05:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
confess for the questions representative
 
05:49:10.070 --> 05:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:49:11.810 --> 05:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
bringing this to our attention
 
05:49:15.650 --> 05:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
a couple questions this is an I believe
 
05:49:19.190 --> 05:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
this is enabling legislation correct yes
 
05:49:20.410 --> 05:49:20.420 align:start position:0%
so so
 
05:49:22.368 --> 05:49:22.378 align:start position:0%
you answer the question the answer is
 
05:49:22.378 --> 05:49:23.628 align:start position:0%
you answer the question the answer is
yes

05:49:23.628 --> 05:49:23.638 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:49:26.750 --> 05:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
um how do you how is the if this if a
 
05:49:29.208 --> 05:49:29.218 align:start position:0%
school district were to authorize this
 
05:49:31.788 --> 05:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
by a three-fifths vote
 
05:49:34.670 --> 05:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh how is the EFA then going to be
 
05:49:37.250 --> 05:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
managed it's managed locally
 
05:49:40.368 --> 05:49:40.378 align:start position:0%
no so it so it's it's a 60 vote to
 
05:49:43.490 --> 05:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
enable and if they enable any kid that
 
05:49:44.690 --> 05:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
participates any student that
 
05:49:46.670 --> 05:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
participates is grandfathered in so if
 
05:49:48.830 --> 05:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
they repeal the program the kids that
 
05:49:50.330 --> 05:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
are in it stay in it till they graduate
 
05:49:51.830 --> 05:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
high school that's just to keep the
 
05:49:54.890 --> 05:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
playing field level the the way the bill
 
05:49:56.990 --> 05:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
is currently written the school district
 
05:50:01.070 --> 05:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
would write a check to a a
 
05:50:03.410 --> 05:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
organization that runs the scholarship
 
05:50:05.090 --> 05:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
so basically New Hampshire Scholarship
 
05:50:06.590 --> 05:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
Foundation or an organization something
 
05:50:08.330 --> 05:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
like that the school district would
 
05:50:10.850 --> 05:50:10.860 align:start position:0%
write the check to that District as the
 
05:50:13.070 --> 05:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
grant into their EFA and then it would
 
05:50:16.490 --> 05:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
be managed just like the state PFA
 
05:50:19.368 --> 05:50:19.378 align:start position:0%
I'm confused if I may yes go ahead I'm
 
05:50:21.590 --> 05:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
confused so
 
05:50:23.448 --> 05:50:23.458 align:start position:0%
um the local school district says we're
 
05:50:24.830 --> 05:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
going to do this and you've got four
 
05:50:26.990 --> 05:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
kids who say they want to take advantage
 
05:50:30.230 --> 05:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
of it yep uh walk me through then how
 
05:50:33.830 --> 05:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
the 9 600 is going to be paid out what's
 
05:50:35.390 --> 05:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
the accountability of where the money's
 
05:50:38.030 --> 05:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
going Etc does that check go are you
 
05:50:40.490 --> 05:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
saying now goes to the state EFA program
 
05:50:43.490 --> 05:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
no no okay I apologize if if I'm making
 
05:50:45.350 --> 05:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
this more sound more confusing than it
 
05:50:45.360 --> 05:50:46.670 align:start position:0%
this more sound more confusing than it
is

05:50:46.670 --> 05:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:50:49.730 --> 05:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
this bill says and I don't know the
 
05:50:51.048 --> 05:50:51.058 align:start position:0%
exact date I can look it up but
 
05:50:53.810 --> 05:50:53.820 align:start position:0%
basically by the second week in July the
 
05:50:55.368 --> 05:50:55.378 align:start position:0%
local school district
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
would cut a check to a scholarship
 
05:51:01.010 --> 05:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
organization that manages efas so it
 
05:51:03.230 --> 05:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
would it would be managed under the same
 
05:51:06.410 --> 05:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations that our current
 
05:51:10.368 --> 05:51:10.378 align:start position:0%
state EFA is operating under the only
 
05:51:13.788 --> 05:51:13.798 align:start position:0%
thing that's changing is who's cutting
 
05:51:15.288 --> 05:51:15.298 align:start position:0%
the check so instead of the state
 
05:51:16.970 --> 05:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
cutting the check to the Scholarship
 
05:51:19.250 --> 05:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
Foundation it's the local school
 
05:51:21.830 --> 05:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
district cutting the check and instead
 
05:51:24.590 --> 05:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
of being cut into into bytes into four
 
05:51:28.310 --> 05:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
distributions it's uh front loaded into
 
05:51:30.230 --> 05:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
into the account
 
05:51:33.650 --> 05:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
so it does go to the state and in this
 
05:51:36.230 --> 05:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
instance the children's scholarship fund
 
05:51:38.628 --> 05:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
and they then manage that check is that
 
05:51:40.430 --> 05:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
correct correct just like they do with
 
05:51:41.930 --> 05:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
the stadium thank you thank you my
 
05:51:43.190 --> 05:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
friend further questions from the
 
05:51:43.200 --> 05:51:46.310 align:start position:0%
friend further questions from the
committee

05:51:46.310 --> 05:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:49.208 --> 05:51:49.218 align:start position:0%
but you can't let me off that easy
 
05:51:52.010 --> 05:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
can you tell me if if uh your community
 
05:51:54.830 --> 05:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
you said you tuition all your grades 9
 
05:51:57.070 --> 05:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
through 12 to Concord
 
05:52:00.530 --> 05:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
so we we're coming to the end of a
 
05:52:02.330 --> 05:52:02.340 align:start position:0%
second 10-year contract with Concord
 
05:52:04.490 --> 05:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
High School and our contract reads that
 
05:52:07.310 --> 05:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
we guarantee to send 90 at least 90
 
05:52:09.530 --> 05:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
percent of our public high school
 
05:52:13.788 --> 05:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
students to Concord so 10 can be
 
05:52:13.798 --> 05:52:14.930 align:start position:0%
students to Concord so 10 can be
assigned

05:52:14.930 --> 05:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
assigned
 
05:52:16.610 --> 05:52:16.620 align:start position:0%
um elsewhere
 
05:52:19.430 --> 05:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
legally we could assign half of our kids
 
05:52:21.530 --> 05:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
elsewhere but then we'd be paying a
 
05:52:23.090 --> 05:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
double tuition we'd still be paying a
 
05:52:24.890 --> 05:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
tuition to Concord even though the
 
05:52:26.510 --> 05:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
student isn't going there so right now
 
05:52:30.470 --> 05:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's a a 90 minimum threshold leaving 10
 
05:52:30.480 --> 05:52:31.850 align:start position:0%
it's a a 90 minimum threshold leaving 10
which

05:52:31.850 --> 05:52:31.860 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:52:34.010 --> 05:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
um my interpretation as the district is
 
05:52:37.070 --> 05:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
using that for manifest hardship best
 
05:52:39.590 --> 05:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
interest of the student out of District
 
05:52:42.410 --> 05:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
placements thank you
 
05:52:46.190 --> 05:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
any further questions represent Balboni
 
05:52:48.288 --> 05:52:48.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:52:49.850 --> 05:52:49.860 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:52:49.860 --> 05:52:50.690 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

05:52:50.690 --> 05:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:53.810 --> 05:52:53.820 align:start position:0%
it two questions really if that's okay
 
05:52:55.910 --> 05:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
um one is you said that it's already in
 
05:52:59.090 --> 05:52:59.100 align:start position:0%
the stature statutes right now that if a
 
05:53:01.788 --> 05:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
community wants to do this they can no
 
05:53:05.150 --> 05:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
no I'm sorry so the the mechanism to
 
05:53:09.350 --> 05:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
enable and disable and the the way that
 
05:53:11.390 --> 05:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
the the question goes on to the ballot
 
05:53:14.090 --> 05:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
is pre-existing in other parts of New
 
05:53:15.830 --> 05:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law so there's there's already
 
05:53:18.770 --> 05:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
precedent for doing it this way that has
 
05:53:21.410 --> 05:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
served our state very very well for for
 
05:53:24.590 --> 05:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
decades so the the idea that the ballot
 
05:53:27.288 --> 05:53:27.298 align:start position:0%
question is defined in law we we do that
 
05:53:29.090 --> 05:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
on a lot of questions there's a lot of
 
05:53:31.190 --> 05:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
Warrant articles that are defined by law
 
05:53:32.868 --> 05:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
and therefore can't be amended all you
 
05:53:34.250 --> 05:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
can do is ask the question and see what
 
05:53:38.628 --> 05:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
the voters say the 60 threshold
 
05:53:41.150 --> 05:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
um is pre-existing in law the the
 
05:53:43.310 --> 05:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
example I know the best is to be for a
 
05:53:45.288 --> 05:53:45.298 align:start position:0%
small community to move from traditional
 
05:53:47.810 --> 05:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
town meeting to what we consider sb2
 
05:53:51.288 --> 05:53:51.298 align:start position:0%
type of local governance and and back
 
05:53:53.170 --> 05:53:53.180 align:start position:0%
um is that 60
 
05:53:56.628 --> 05:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
threshold it could be set to 51 you know
 
05:53:58.128 --> 05:53:58.138 align:start position:0%
a majority you could have a you could
 
05:54:00.708 --> 05:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
have a simple majority the idea of the
 
05:54:04.128 --> 05:54:04.138 align:start position:0%
60 is to show you know a high degree of
 
05:54:06.530 --> 05:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
support for whichever direction the
 
05:54:09.048 --> 05:54:09.058 align:start position:0%
community is choosing to to move so so
 
05:54:11.330 --> 05:54:11.340 align:start position:0%
for Community to enable this you have to
 
05:54:14.150 --> 05:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
give 60 in the affirmative uh if a
 
05:54:16.128 --> 05:54:16.138 align:start position:0%
community so so there's there's people
 
05:54:17.750 --> 05:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
that say well you know it's a it's a
 
05:54:19.190 --> 05:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
runaway fiscal train and you're going to
 
05:54:20.628 --> 05:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
bankrupt the school
 
05:54:22.970 --> 05:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that'll happen I really
 
05:54:22.980 --> 05:54:24.230 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that'll happen I really
don't

05:54:24.230 --> 05:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:54:27.288 --> 05:54:27.298 align:start position:0%
but if it did there's an escape Clause
 
05:54:29.208 --> 05:54:29.218 align:start position:0%
right so all of a sudden your tax bill
 
05:54:30.948 --> 05:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
is mushrooming because the cost is
 
05:54:32.750 --> 05:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
spiraling out of control because God
 
05:54:33.890 --> 05:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
only you know whatever set of
 
05:54:37.070 --> 05:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
circumstance creates that a 60 repeals
 
05:54:38.090 --> 05:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
the program
 
05:54:40.610 --> 05:54:40.620 align:start position:0%
so if Community decides to try it and
 
05:54:42.170 --> 05:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
they're doing it and they go you know
 
05:54:44.448 --> 05:54:44.458 align:start position:0%
actually now that we're doing it it
 
05:54:45.650 --> 05:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
really we found out it really doesn't
 
05:54:47.628 --> 05:54:47.638 align:start position:0%
work for us you you can disable the
 
05:54:50.390 --> 05:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
program uh and go back to doing what you
 
05:54:51.410 --> 05:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
were doing
 
05:54:54.230 --> 05:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
and follow up yes directly to what
 
05:54:55.850 --> 05:54:55.860 align:start position:0%
you've just said though but in the bill
 
05:54:58.310 --> 05:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's written on your the school
 
05:55:00.708 --> 05:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
district is still responsible
 
05:55:03.288 --> 05:55:03.298 align:start position:0%
um it forever until the child ages out
 
05:55:06.470 --> 05:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
of high school for the amount so that
 
05:55:07.910 --> 05:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't really change the financial
 
05:55:11.690 --> 05:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
obligation of the district so so
 
05:55:14.270 --> 05:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
I I disagree with that I understand your
 
05:55:15.530 --> 05:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
logic I understand where you're coming
 
05:55:18.948 --> 05:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
from so we have to make it fair for
 
05:55:20.750 --> 05:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
everybody it has to be fair for the
 
05:55:22.970 --> 05:55:22.980 align:start position:0%
district but it also has to be fair for
 
05:55:25.788 --> 05:55:25.798 align:start position:0%
students and families right so if a town
 
05:55:28.128 --> 05:55:28.138 align:start position:0%
enables a program like this
 
05:55:30.470 --> 05:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
and a student avails himself of it and
 
05:55:32.628 --> 05:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
they find the the best educational fit
 
05:55:34.850 --> 05:55:34.860 align:start position:0%
for them and the child is thriving and
 
05:55:37.250 --> 05:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
doing really really well and then the
 
05:55:38.810 --> 05:55:38.820 align:start position:0%
community decides now we're not going to
 
05:55:40.250 --> 05:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
do this anymore for whatever reason
 
05:55:44.628 --> 05:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
right to then say to that child hey you
 
05:55:46.628 --> 05:55:46.638 align:start position:0%
know those four great years you just had
 
05:55:49.548 --> 05:55:49.558 align:start position:0%
really glad you enjoyed that we've
 
05:55:51.350 --> 05:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
changed our mind you're you're going
 
05:55:54.288 --> 05:55:54.298 align:start position:0%
back here that
 
05:55:56.208 --> 05:55:56.218 align:start position:0%
that to me
 
05:55:58.670 --> 05:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
is unfair to the child
 
05:56:02.330 --> 05:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
and to the family and so it and it's not
 
05:56:04.910 --> 05:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
forever right it's it's to the age of 20
 
05:56:07.430 --> 05:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
or to graduation from high school so it
 
05:56:10.250 --> 05:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
it does time out it does unwind itself
 
05:56:12.110 --> 05:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
it winds itself down
 
05:56:14.448 --> 05:56:14.458 align:start position:0%
um over time the the other thing I I
 
05:56:16.490 --> 05:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
didn't mention that is worth mentioning
 
05:56:19.310 --> 05:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
right is the first year a child of proof
 
05:56:21.830 --> 05:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
is approved into the program that is a
 
05:56:23.270 --> 05:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
minimum Grant
 
05:56:25.788 --> 05:56:25.798 align:start position:0%
okay and the reason that's a minimum
 
05:56:28.610 --> 05:56:28.620 align:start position:0%
Grant is because you don't want families
 
05:56:30.170 --> 05:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden getting half of what
 
05:56:31.610 --> 05:56:31.620 align:start position:0%
they thought they were getting and now
 
05:56:33.048 --> 05:56:33.058 align:start position:0%
now they can't do what they want to do
 
05:56:34.610 --> 05:56:34.620 align:start position:0%
because the the financials haven't
 
05:56:37.368 --> 05:56:37.378 align:start position:0%
worked so the grants are recalculated
 
05:56:40.970 --> 05:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
each year and it can go up and down but
 
05:56:42.890 --> 05:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
for a particular child it can never drop
 
05:56:45.830 --> 05:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
below the first year grant that way the
 
05:56:49.010 --> 05:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
families know what their financial floor
 
05:56:52.128 --> 05:56:52.138 align:start position:0%
is right that this is this is a point
 
05:56:53.868 --> 05:56:53.878 align:start position:0%
where we're guaranteed and we don't drop
 
05:56:56.030 --> 05:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
below that so it's to allow a certain
 
05:56:57.288 --> 05:56:57.298 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
05:57:00.350 --> 05:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
um of fairness and where this is is tied
 
05:57:02.628 --> 05:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
to State adequacy you know one would
 
05:57:05.570 --> 05:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
expect it'll stay relatively consistent
 
05:57:08.810 --> 05:57:08.820 align:start position:0%
for Fairly large chunks of time uh
 
05:57:11.810 --> 05:57:11.820 align:start position:0%
without giant fluctuations
 
05:57:13.548 --> 05:57:13.558 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
05:57:17.570 --> 05:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:19.368 --> 05:57:19.378 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you very much thank you
 
05:57:25.310 --> 05:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:47.750 --> 05:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:47.760 --> 05:57:48.590 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:57:48.590 --> 05:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:57:51.350 --> 05:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my name is David
 
05:57:53.930 --> 05:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
Trumbull I'm from where I am opposed to
 
05:57:57.230 --> 05:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
this bill for a few reasons first of all
 
05:57:59.810 --> 05:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
I think that it misstates the duty of
 
05:57:59.820 --> 05:58:01.310 align:start position:0%
I think that it misstates the duty of
Education

05:58:01.310 --> 05:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
Education
 
05:58:04.128 --> 05:58:04.138 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire has the duty
 
05:58:06.410 --> 05:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
to educate children in the state not the
 
05:58:08.990 --> 05:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
towns the the presenter of the bill said
 
05:58:11.330 --> 05:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
that it's up to our towns to educate our
 
05:58:13.250 --> 05:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
children it's their Duty that's not the
 
05:58:15.230 --> 05:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
case the Supreme Court looked at the
 
05:58:19.128 --> 05:58:19.138 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment about education
 
05:58:22.430 --> 05:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
and said it is the state's duty to
 
05:58:24.288 --> 05:58:24.298 align:start position:0%
educate the children and that's why the
 
05:58:25.850 --> 05:58:25.860 align:start position:0%
Claremont decision has been so
 
05:58:27.530 --> 05:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
contentious because the state has
 
05:58:30.170 --> 05:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
shifted 80 percent of the cost to the
 
05:58:33.170 --> 05:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
towns the towns run the schools the
 
05:58:34.788 --> 05:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
towns are stuck with 80 percent of the
 
05:58:37.128 --> 05:58:37.138 align:start position:0%
bill but the duty to educate is the
 
05:58:39.770 --> 05:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
states it is not the town's duty to do
 
05:58:42.170 --> 05:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
that the second you know the other thing
 
05:58:44.510 --> 05:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
that was said was that we don't have any
 
05:58:46.010 --> 05:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
public schools in New Hampshire I mean
 
05:58:47.868 --> 05:58:47.878 align:start position:0%
obviously our state laws disagree with
 
05:58:51.048 --> 05:58:51.058 align:start position:0%
that for example RSA 19338 says that all
 
05:58:52.670 --> 05:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
the public schools in the state cannot
 
05:58:54.470 --> 05:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
discriminate there's a difference
 
05:58:56.448 --> 05:58:56.458 align:start position:0%
between a public school and a private
 
05:58:58.670 --> 05:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
school that's the differentiation so
 
05:59:01.070 --> 05:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
that the fact that a child from a
 
05:59:02.868 --> 05:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
different town does can't automatically
 
05:59:04.368 --> 05:59:04.378 align:start position:0%
go to a school in another town doesn't
 
05:59:06.410 --> 05:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
mean that other Town School is not a
 
05:59:08.930 --> 05:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
public school it is a public school by
 
05:59:10.970 --> 05:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
Statute it is a public school it's our
 
05:59:12.470 --> 05:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
common understanding of what a public
 
05:59:13.670 --> 05:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
school is
 
05:59:15.770 --> 05:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
the second reason that I object to this
 
05:59:17.150 --> 05:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
bill is that I think it will cause
 
05:59:20.208 --> 05:59:20.218 align:start position:0%
significant harm to our local schools
 
05:59:22.850 --> 05:59:22.860 align:start position:0%
the amount of five thousand dollars of
 
05:59:26.090 --> 05:59:26.100 align:start position:0%
uh times two gets to 9 600 and that's
 
05:59:27.890 --> 05:59:27.900 align:start position:0%
going to go up so let's call it ten
 
05:59:30.288 --> 05:59:30.298 align:start position:0%
thousand in his school district that is
 
05:59:32.570 --> 05:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
only spending and the speaker said well
 
05:59:35.090 --> 05:59:35.100 align:start position:0%
that's only 40 percent of this this
 
05:59:37.270 --> 05:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
town's spending that may be true
 
05:59:39.890 --> 05:59:39.900 align:start position:0%
Statewide but in the poorer communities
 
05:59:42.410 --> 05:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
it's way more than 40 percent in my town
 
05:59:46.010 --> 05:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
we spend 16 000 for a child 10 000 over
 
05:59:50.390 --> 05:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
16 is like 65 percent ish so losing that
 
05:59:53.208 --> 05:59:53.218 align:start position:0%
money will seriously that
 
05:59:55.070 --> 05:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
schools that are the subject of the
 
05:59:56.448 --> 05:59:56.458 align:start position:0%
Claremont law school these are the
 
05:59:58.788 --> 05:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
schools that can't afford to lose that
 
06:00:00.470 --> 06:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
amount of money what will they end up
 
06:00:02.270 --> 06:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
doing when they have this cut they're
 
06:00:03.708 --> 06:00:03.718 align:start position:0%
going to have to get rid of all the
 
06:00:05.628 --> 06:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
programs that make their school hold
 
06:00:08.990 --> 06:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
together after school programs bullying
 
06:00:12.110 --> 06:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
programs gifted programs French and
 
06:00:15.230 --> 06:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
Spanish are music and phys Ed they're
 
06:00:17.030 --> 06:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
all going to get lost because they won't
 
06:00:19.610 --> 06:00:19.620 align:start position:0%
have the funds after this money is
 
06:00:19.620 --> 06:00:21.170 align:start position:0%
have the funds after this money is
withdrawn

06:00:21.170 --> 06:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
withdrawn
 
06:00:23.150 --> 06:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
the other issue on the local schools
 
06:00:24.890 --> 06:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
that I think this bill misunderstands
 
06:00:27.170 --> 06:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
what a school is a school is run as a
 
06:00:29.448 --> 06:00:29.458 align:start position:0%
long-term proposition people move into a
 
06:00:30.890 --> 06:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
town because they want to be part of the
 
06:00:32.570 --> 06:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
community and that means having their
 
06:00:34.128 --> 06:00:34.138 align:start position:0%
children go to the school in that town
 
06:00:35.750 --> 06:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
the people who run the schools the
 
06:00:38.150 --> 06:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
school boards spend tremendous amounts
 
06:00:40.368 --> 06:00:40.378 align:start position:0%
of volunteer time to run the schools to
 
06:00:42.708 --> 06:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
run them as long-term institutions this
 
06:00:44.510 --> 06:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
goes to when do we build a new school
 
06:00:47.510 --> 06:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
when do we upgrade our athletic grounds
 
06:00:49.548 --> 06:00:49.558 align:start position:0%
building a sense of community in the
 
06:00:51.590 --> 06:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
school building policies so that we
 
06:00:53.330 --> 06:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
teach this in this grade and moves on to
 
06:00:54.830 --> 06:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
this grade there's a lot of work that
 
06:00:57.288 --> 06:00:57.298 align:start position:0%
goes into building a school sense of
 
06:01:00.230 --> 06:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
community this bill doesn't respect that
 
06:01:02.628 --> 06:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
because when that money gets sucked out
 
06:01:04.730 --> 06:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
of those schools the schools won't be
 
06:01:06.530 --> 06:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
able to maintain that sense of community
 
06:01:08.628 --> 06:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
so I understand the bill says well what
 
06:01:10.368 --> 06:01:10.378 align:start position:0%
about this child who really wants to go
 
06:01:12.590 --> 06:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
someplace special but what about all the
 
06:01:14.750 --> 06:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
families who moved into a town and lived
 
06:01:16.430 --> 06:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
there and they want to maintain the
 
06:01:18.288 --> 06:01:18.298 align:start position:0%
basic school that already exists there
 
06:01:20.628 --> 06:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
this bill will gut our local schools
 
06:01:23.208 --> 06:01:23.218 align:start position:0%
it's basically an attempt to do to the
 
06:01:26.030 --> 06:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
whole state what almost happened in
 
06:01:28.490 --> 06:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
Croydon last year and we should avoid
 
06:01:31.670 --> 06:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
doing that because that is a shallow
 
06:01:34.310 --> 06:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
concept of the social contract we should
 
06:01:35.930 --> 06:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
have a deeper
 
06:01:38.150 --> 06:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
conception of our social contract to
 
06:01:41.030 --> 06:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
each other that we start with the basics
 
06:01:43.190 --> 06:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
which is our public school which brings
 
06:01:44.868 --> 06:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
me to the third reason I object to this
 
06:01:48.368 --> 06:01:48.378 align:start position:0%
bill there's no data that indicates that
 
06:01:51.288 --> 06:01:51.298 align:start position:0%
this program works we've got a pilot
 
06:01:54.470 --> 06:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
program with 80 some odd percent of the
 
06:01:56.330 --> 06:01:56.340 align:start position:0%
students in it were already in private
 
06:01:58.128 --> 06:01:58.138 align:start position:0%
schools you have just a couple hundred
 
06:02:00.530 --> 06:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
at most children who have moved from one
 
06:02:02.390 --> 06:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
school to another and now we want to
 
06:02:05.330 --> 06:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
redo the entire New Hampshire education
 
06:02:07.850 --> 06:02:07.860 align:start position:0%
system with bills from this morning that
 
06:02:09.770 --> 06:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
could easily cost 100 or 200 million
 
06:02:12.230 --> 06:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
dollars and this one now turns our local
 
06:02:14.390 --> 06:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
schools into taking over the state's
 
06:02:17.208 --> 06:02:17.218 align:start position:0%
role of being responsible to running the
 
06:02:20.150 --> 06:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
duty to educate it makes no sense to do
 
06:02:22.070 --> 06:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
that unless you know it works this
 
06:02:23.570 --> 06:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
morning I was reading a little bit of
 
06:02:25.670 --> 06:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
evidence to you about some of the issues
 
06:02:27.708 --> 06:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
with the uh
 
06:02:30.410 --> 06:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
Choice programs scholarship programs
 
06:02:32.690 --> 06:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
voucher programs no disrespect is meant
 
06:02:34.190 --> 06:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
by using the word voucher just that's
 
06:02:35.868 --> 06:02:35.878 align:start position:0%
the word that the education literature
 
06:02:38.270 --> 06:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
is uses but I will reduce something from
 
06:02:39.948 --> 06:02:39.958 align:start position:0%
Indiana this is from the center for tax
 
06:02:41.690 --> 06:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
and budget accountability they studied
 
06:02:43.850 --> 06:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
Indiana school choice scholarship and
 
06:02:45.288 --> 06:02:45.298 align:start position:0%
what they said was basically it's going
 
06:02:47.208 --> 06:02:47.218 align:start position:0%
to divert public tax dollars away from
 
06:02:48.708 --> 06:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
the state's higher performing public
 
06:02:50.990 --> 06:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
schools to the lower performing private
 
06:02:52.910 --> 06:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
religious schools they said well what's
 
06:02:54.650 --> 06:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
going on in other countries this issue
 
06:02:56.570 --> 06:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
came up it's they read this is a quote
 
06:02:57.770 --> 06:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
the Nations that have been most
 
06:02:59.150 --> 06:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
successful in improving student
 
06:03:01.448 --> 06:03:01.458 align:start position:0%
achievement over time and focused on
 
06:03:03.770 --> 06:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
systems-based reforms that build
 
06:03:06.470 --> 06:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
capacity of the overall education system
 
06:03:09.048 --> 06:03:09.058 align:start position:0%
and have astewed reforms based on
 
06:03:11.690 --> 06:03:11.700 align:start position:0%
competition and choice meanwhile Nations
 
06:03:13.610 --> 06:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
that have taken the competition Choice
 
06:03:16.730 --> 06:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
path to education reform have failed to
 
06:03:18.830 --> 06:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
realize enhanced student achievement and
 
06:03:20.208 --> 06:03:20.218 align:start position:0%
that's really the fundamental problem
 
06:03:22.190 --> 06:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
with this bill we've got a pilot project
 
06:03:24.948 --> 06:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
that doesn't work it hasn't worked
 
06:03:26.990 --> 06:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
around the country it hasn't worked
 
06:03:29.090 --> 06:03:29.100 align:start position:0%
around the world we're going to upturn
 
06:03:31.128 --> 06:03:31.138 align:start position:0%
our complete education system to do it
 
06:03:33.048 --> 06:03:33.058 align:start position:0%
because some people think education is
 
06:03:35.208 --> 06:03:35.218 align:start position:0%
like buying coffee or other products
 
06:03:38.448 --> 06:03:38.458 align:start position:0%
it's not a product it's the way we build
 
06:03:40.548 --> 06:03:40.558 align:start position:0%
our communities is through our schools
 
06:03:43.670 --> 06:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
so this bill basically tries to say the
 
06:03:45.770 --> 06:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
schools become sort of like well it's
 
06:03:47.270 --> 06:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
just it's built on the concept of
 
06:03:48.770 --> 06:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
competition and I think that is the
 
06:03:50.868 --> 06:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
fundamental flaw in this bill we should
 
06:03:52.610 --> 06:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
look at our schools as the foundation of
 
06:03:55.368 --> 06:03:55.378 align:start position:0%
our communities instead thank you thank
 
06:03:57.230 --> 06:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions from the
 
06:03:57.240 --> 06:03:59.090 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions from the
committee

06:03:59.090 --> 06:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:04:00.830 --> 06:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
they don't miss the chairman not seeing
 
06:04:04.850 --> 06:04:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:19.190 --> 06:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:22.430 --> 06:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
06:04:24.288 --> 06:04:24.298 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman and members of
 
06:04:25.910 --> 06:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
the committee glad to be back here again
 
06:04:28.430 --> 06:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh I am the President of American
 
06:04:31.190 --> 06:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
Federation of teachers New Hampshire and
 
06:04:33.410 --> 06:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
I am here to speak on behalf of our 4
 
06:04:36.410 --> 06:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
000 members and the 165 000 Public
 
06:04:38.510 --> 06:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
Schools students in New Hampshire I was
 
06:04:39.530 --> 06:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
a little surprised to hear there's no
 
06:04:40.970 --> 06:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
such thing as public school I would
 
06:04:43.128 --> 06:04:43.138 align:start position:0%
disagree about that
 
06:04:46.970 --> 06:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
um and we are here opposing HP 538 I
 
06:04:48.590 --> 06:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
would agree with the speaker right
 
06:04:50.690 --> 06:04:50.700 align:start position:0%
before me who said that is the state's
 
06:04:52.810 --> 06:04:52.820 align:start position:0%
obligation to provide public education
 
06:04:56.750 --> 06:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
and uh to fund it adequately HP 538
 
06:04:58.910 --> 06:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
would create a local voucher program and
 
06:05:00.590 --> 06:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
it could easily decimate our local
 
06:05:03.048 --> 06:05:03.058 align:start position:0%
neighborhood Public Schools it would
 
06:05:04.310 --> 06:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
leave our students with only a
 
06:05:07.368 --> 06:05:07.378 align:start position:0%
threadbare education
 
06:05:09.890 --> 06:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
when you have students leaving your
 
06:05:12.770 --> 06:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
local schools for
 
06:05:12.780 --> 06:05:14.208 align:start position:0%
local schools for
choice

06:05:14.208 --> 06:05:14.218 align:start position:0%
choice
 
06:05:16.010 --> 06:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
and taking the funding with them the
 
06:05:17.510 --> 06:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
things that get cut first are the things
 
06:05:19.368 --> 06:05:19.378 align:start position:0%
that make the schools vibrant the things
 
06:05:23.390 --> 06:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
that make schools valuable I was just
 
06:05:24.948 --> 06:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
having a discussion with the gentleman
 
06:05:26.448 --> 06:05:26.458 align:start position:0%
back there who is on his local school
 
06:05:29.990 --> 06:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
board and they're facing increased class
 
06:05:33.128 --> 06:05:33.138 align:start position:0%
sizes loss of paraprofessionals because
 
06:05:37.128 --> 06:05:37.138 align:start position:0%
their state aid has been cut back
 
06:05:39.350 --> 06:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
those are the things that go first music
 
06:05:41.510 --> 06:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
art student learning support Library
 
06:05:43.910 --> 06:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation Sports I'll be on the
 
06:05:45.530 --> 06:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
chopping block
 
06:05:48.170 --> 06:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
uh as local communities struggle to keep
 
06:05:50.150 --> 06:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
up with cutbacks because as we have
 
06:05:52.250 --> 06:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
heard over and over again there really
 
06:05:54.490 --> 06:05:54.500 align:start position:0%
isn't further to go with property taxes
 
06:05:57.110 --> 06:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are Tapped Out
 
06:05:58.910 --> 06:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
you can't dig into Pockets that are
 
06:06:01.490 --> 06:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
already empty and and
 
06:06:05.330 --> 06:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
um there's just no further you can go
 
06:06:07.788 --> 06:06:07.798 align:start position:0%
um unlike the state voucher program this
 
06:06:09.410 --> 06:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
program has no income eligibility
 
06:06:11.690 --> 06:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
restrictions which means you're going to
 
06:06:13.670 --> 06:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
be asking struggling families to reach
 
06:06:16.010 --> 06:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
into their pockets to pay for you know
 
06:06:18.708 --> 06:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
someone to go to St Paul's or Phillips
 
06:06:21.410 --> 06:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
Exeter and that's just not fair
 
06:06:23.570 --> 06:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
Grant State families want quality
 
06:06:25.310 --> 06:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
stability and predictability and they
 
06:06:27.048 --> 06:06:27.058 align:start position:0%
get that with their local neighborhood
 
06:06:29.628 --> 06:06:29.638 align:start position:0%
Public Schools they don't want to take a
 
06:06:34.310 --> 06:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
chance on the promise of maybe
 
06:06:37.430 --> 06:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
an option being developed in competition
 
06:06:40.190 --> 06:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
in the future of something better that
 
06:06:42.890 --> 06:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
could come on the horizon they want
 
06:06:44.810 --> 06:06:44.820 align:start position:0%
schools that they know they want schools
 
06:06:46.430 --> 06:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
that they have a say in a voice in
 
06:06:48.410 --> 06:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
through their school boards and they
 
06:06:51.590 --> 06:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
they want predictability this program
 
06:06:53.208 --> 06:06:53.218 align:start position:0%
would have the opposite effect and could
 
06:06:54.890 --> 06:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
lead to a Bare Bones education instead
 
06:06:56.690 --> 06:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
of the robust education that our
 
06:06:58.250 --> 06:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
students deserve and that they are
 
06:07:00.230 --> 06:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
getting in their neighborhood public
 
06:07:02.448 --> 06:07:02.458 align:start position:0%
schools and for those reasons we are
 
06:07:05.570 --> 06:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
opposing HB 538
 
06:07:08.448 --> 06:07:08.458 align:start position:0%
and Brookstone cordelli yep thank you
 
06:07:10.850 --> 06:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for sticking around
 
06:07:15.288 --> 06:07:15.298 align:start position:0%
um I I think you mentioned um students
 
06:07:17.150 --> 06:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
leaving for Choice
 
06:07:19.010 --> 06:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
um programs and the effects that it had
 
06:07:21.430 --> 06:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
with various programs at local school
 
06:07:24.830 --> 06:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
but what about the children who leave
 
06:07:26.810 --> 06:07:26.820 align:start position:0%
for other reasons I know in my local
 
06:07:28.150 --> 06:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
school district
 
06:07:32.868 --> 06:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
last year 104 students left enrollment
 
06:07:36.350 --> 06:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
dropped by 104 students but only 21 left
 
06:07:39.230 --> 06:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
for Education Freedom accounts 83 left
 
06:07:39.240 --> 06:07:40.250 align:start position:0%
for Education Freedom accounts 83 left
for

06:07:40.250 --> 06:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:07:42.410 --> 06:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
other reasons
 
06:07:47.150 --> 06:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not sure how we would Define
 
06:07:51.590 --> 06:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
the trouble on those 21 students leaving
 
06:07:54.170 --> 06:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
causing disruption to the programs in in
 
06:07:55.730 --> 06:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
the district
 
06:07:57.650 --> 06:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
What can you
 
06:08:01.128 --> 06:08:01.138 align:start position:0%
explain I can't explain something with
 
06:08:03.350 --> 06:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
that amount of information because it's
 
06:08:04.850 --> 06:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
hard to
 
06:08:04.860 --> 06:08:06.128 align:start position:0%
hard to
um

06:08:06.128 --> 06:08:06.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:09.288 --> 06:08:09.298 align:start position:0%
you know it's hard to really answer a
 
06:08:11.570 --> 06:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
question with so little information if
 
06:08:12.830 --> 06:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
you're talking about students leaving
 
06:08:14.510 --> 06:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
and taking funding with them then you
 
06:08:16.128 --> 06:08:16.138 align:start position:0%
have to take apart programs and
 
06:08:17.750 --> 06:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
therefore you are not providing what the
 
06:08:19.190 --> 06:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
rest of the students are expect and
 
06:08:20.510 --> 06:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
their families are expecting in their
 
06:08:20.520 --> 06:08:22.070 align:start position:0%
their families are expecting in their
schools

06:08:22.070 --> 06:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
schools
 
06:08:22.080 --> 06:08:23.230 align:start position:0%
schools
yeah

06:08:23.230 --> 06:08:23.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:08:23.240 --> 06:08:24.770 align:start position:0%
yeah
but

06:08:24.770 --> 06:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:08:27.110 --> 06:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
students will leave for non-choice
 
06:08:30.470 --> 06:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
reasons the funding goes away for them
 
06:08:38.810 --> 06:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:40.208 --> 06:08:40.218 align:start position:0%
the the
 
06:08:44.330 --> 06:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
those questions I'm having difficulty
 
06:08:47.150 --> 06:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
with picturing what your example means
 
06:08:49.850 --> 06:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
so the 84 students who left for
 
06:08:53.270 --> 06:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
non-choice reasons the following year
 
06:08:55.670 --> 06:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
the state money would go away for those
 
06:08:57.170 --> 06:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
students also
 
06:08:57.180 --> 06:09:00.830 align:start position:0%
students also
right

06:09:00.830 --> 06:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:04.070 --> 06:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
so it's not so funding disappears if a
 
06:09:06.650 --> 06:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
child leaves for whatever reason
 
06:09:10.010 --> 06:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
isn't that the case
 
06:09:11.750 --> 06:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
that would seem to be the case yes I'm
 
06:09:14.628 --> 06:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
still trying to work through
 
06:09:16.548 --> 06:09:16.558 align:start position:0%
leaving for non-choice reasons but maybe
 
06:09:18.110 --> 06:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
we can have a conversation later and you
 
06:09:20.510 --> 06:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
can explain in more detail what you mean
 
06:09:22.250 --> 06:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
06:09:24.948 --> 06:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
I I have a question for you
 
06:09:24.958 --> 06:09:26.330 align:start position:0%
I I have a question for you
um

06:09:26.330 --> 06:09:26.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:28.430 --> 06:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
we know that there are students in
 
06:09:30.830 --> 06:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
schools that are undergoing daily
 
06:09:33.590 --> 06:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
repeated bullying
 
06:09:35.930 --> 06:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
we know that there are schools that are
 
06:09:37.970 --> 06:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the proficiency levels
 
06:09:41.410 --> 06:09:41.420 align:start position:0%
in mathematics and reading
 
06:09:44.090 --> 06:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
and we know that a child's in the fourth
 
06:09:45.708 --> 06:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
grade just once in their life they're
 
06:09:49.128 --> 06:09:49.138 align:start position:0%
nine years old once do you believe the
 
06:09:51.730 --> 06:09:51.740 align:start position:0%
parent then should seek out
 
06:09:54.830 --> 06:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
alternative education for their child or
 
06:09:57.770 --> 06:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
keep them in that bullying situation or
 
06:09:59.390 --> 06:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
that situation where they're not
 
06:10:02.270 --> 06:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
learning any mathematics
 
06:10:05.628 --> 06:10:05.638 align:start position:0%
so there are several other options for
 
06:10:08.628 --> 06:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
how to address each of those situations
 
06:10:12.110 --> 06:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
and you know there are
 
06:10:15.590 --> 06:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
currently ways to uh deal with
 
06:10:18.410 --> 06:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
persistent bullying including requesting
 
06:10:20.270 --> 06:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
a manifest hardship if it reaches that
 
06:10:22.070 --> 06:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
far without any
 
06:10:24.350 --> 06:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
um resolution when you work through the
 
06:10:26.448 --> 06:10:26.458 align:start position:0%
process before that
 
06:10:29.510 --> 06:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
um but how does
 
06:10:32.868 --> 06:10:32.878 align:start position:0%
having a town-wide vote that can lead to
 
06:10:34.490 --> 06:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
dismantling the public school for
 
06:10:36.890 --> 06:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
everyone in town help the situation
 
06:10:40.270 --> 06:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:42.708 --> 06:10:42.718 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
06:10:44.770 --> 06:10:44.780 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
06:10:49.310 --> 06:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:51.048 --> 06:10:51.058 align:start position:0%
do we have any other pink cards on the
 
06:10:53.270 --> 06:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
news film
 
06:10:55.430 --> 06:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
I guess we have no for the pink cards on
 
06:10:57.590 --> 06:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
the bill so this uh hearing is over
 
06:10:57.600 --> 06:10:59.390 align:start position:0%
the bill so this uh hearing is over
completed

06:10:59.390 --> 06:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
completed
 
06:11:02.330 --> 06:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
and we are done the bills for today
 
06:11:04.850 --> 06:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
however I want to really let everybody
 
06:11:08.150 --> 06:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
on the committee know that on the 24th
 
06:11:10.850 --> 06:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
we have those bills set for hearing that
 
06:11:13.730 --> 06:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
are already in the calendar but I will
 
06:11:15.708 --> 06:11:15.718 align:start position:0%
be announcing on the floor
 
06:11:18.590 --> 06:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
tomorrow that we will be exacting
 
06:11:22.548 --> 06:11:22.558 align:start position:0%
certain bills also on that day so keep
 
06:11:24.830 --> 06:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
your ears open so you can understand
 
06:11:27.230 --> 06:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
which bills which we will be exacting on
 
06:11:30.530 --> 06:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
the 24th we have problem as of the 24th
 
06:11:32.930 --> 06:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
we will have 93 hearings in this
 
06:11:35.448 --> 06:11:35.458 align:start position:0%
committee and approximately 50 of our
 
06:11:37.910 --> 06:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
exec sessions are complete that leaves
 
06:11:42.708 --> 06:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
50 roughly or 47 to go still so
 
06:11:44.930 --> 06:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
um got away so we're going to have to
 
06:11:47.270 --> 06:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
really try to get make use of every
 
06:11:49.190 --> 06:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
moment we have and I'd like to do that
 
06:11:51.230 --> 06:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
on the 24th as well
