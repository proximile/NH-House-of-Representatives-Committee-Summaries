00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Jim
 
00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
majori representing Rockingham 23 the
 
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
beautiful town of Northampton um I
 
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
preface this by saying I do understand
 
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh that there is an amendment that is
 
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 align:start position:0%
going to be brought forward I'm not sure
 
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
the timing for that but there is a
 
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
general support for that Amendment um I
 
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
would welcome all questions to be
 
00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
phrased as would you believe because
 
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
there might be some on the committee who
 
00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
know as much if not more about this bill
 
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
than I do anyway uh with that I'd like
 
00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
to introduce House Bill 1052 relative to
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
the format of Excavating and dredging
 
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 align:start position:0%
permit applications currently permit
 
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
applications need to be submitted in
 
00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
paper form four of which need to be
 
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
submitted to the town with this bill
 
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
what we would what we be what we would
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
be doing is amending RSA 482
 
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
A3 uh to allow for one of those to allow
 
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
for one paper copy and then a digital
 
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
copy uh to be uh submitted to the town
 
00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 align:start position:0%
uh again I I know that there's an
 
00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
amendment coming I might look behind me
 
00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 align:start position:0%
and wonder if somebody is going to be
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
speaking good there is going to be
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
somebody speaking to this uh with that
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
very simple summary I would uh open the
 
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
floor to any questions that the
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
committee might have thank you
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
representative representative power
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:00.759 align:start position:0%
taking my question sure
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
so originally the current
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
statute requires four copies paper
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
copies and the bill is changing that as
 
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
you stated to one paper copy and a
 
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
digital copy so I'd like to understand
 
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
um presently why are four copies um
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
needed and what is done with the four
 
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
copies and and my concern is is is One
 
00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
Cop Cy one hard copy going to be
 
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
sufficient for the
 
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
purposes thank you for the question and
 
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
speaking only from my perspective in
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
Northampton where we don't get as many
 
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.029 align:start position:0%
Northampton where we don't get as many
of

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:44.120 align:start position:0%
these when I brought this up to uh to
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
the officials in town we only need one
 
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
copy it's not being circulated to that
 
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
many boards and commissions such that we
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
need the four hard copies to be
 
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
circulated around with one hard that can
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
be copied and sent to committee and one
 
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
digital it sufficed I I I would like to
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
think that that is what is consistent or
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
that that same feeling is consistent and
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
the reason for the bill go ahead thank
 
00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so I understand that you're
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
not the prime sponsor of the bill
 
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:17.240 align:start position:0%
correct and that you are the co-sponsor
 
00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
correct so when I um looked at this bill
 
00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:21.869 align:start position:0%
correct so when I um looked at this bill
in

00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:21.879 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:25.240 align:start position:0%
context um if you put it in context it's
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
any the previous part of the statute
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
says any person seeking to obtain a
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
permit shall submit to the department
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
and the department in this section of
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
Statute is referring to the dees the
 
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services so
 
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
it's that
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
department that is receiving the four
 
00:08:49.949 --> 00:08:49.959 align:start position:0%
copies and perhaps I can Reas my
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
question to someone else oh AB
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and I would think that
 
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
that your question is probably best and
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question thank you for
 
00:08:59.949 --> 00:08:59.959 align:start position:0%
the followup I think uh I I would like
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
to think that the prime uh submitted the
 
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
bill for that very same reason and again
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
maybe I should have been more clear when
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
speaking about my own Community that's
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
the way we do it I I can't speak to
 
00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
exactly that that's the way Dees might
 
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
respond to that um but would hope that
 
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:17.720 align:start position:0%
the prime might be able to have an
 
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
answer to that question I apologize that
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
I don't thank you for that I did just
 
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:26.200 align:start position:0%
receive a text from the prime he's
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
behind an accident on 93 North nor so
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
he's still trying to get here and I'm
 
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
pretty sure he will have a good answer
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
for that further
 
00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none uh representative
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
lales ye yes thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm just
 
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
wondering if there are communities
 
00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959 align:start position:0%
perhaps in the North
 
00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:55.750 align:start position:0%
perhaps in the North
country

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
that don't deal with electronic copies
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
as much or if there are any
 
00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:05.079 align:start position:0%
municipalities that don't have the
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
capability of dealing with anything
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
other than paper I I understand that in
 
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
most communities the first thing that
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
the municipality or the department does
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
is probably turn it into a digital copy
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
right off the bat but there may be
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
communities up north
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
or anywhere really that don't deal with
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
electronic copies I'm just wondering
 
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.389 align:start position:0%
electronic copies I'm just wondering
about

00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question and I
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
and I think that uh I think given some
 
00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:39.399 align:start position:0%
of the other discussion we've had with
 
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
some with some other bills that that
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
should always be one of the
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
considerations that we have the capacity
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
for every Community to be able to
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
benefit and the even if it's a not the
 
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences for those
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
communities who might not I'm sorry that
 
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
I don't have a good answer for you but I
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
do think that it should be at least a
 
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.230 align:start position:0%
do think that it should be at least a
consideration

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thank you for taking my
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
question is the reason for the four
 
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
copies uh the original four copies the
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
fact that they have to be posted on site
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
at the dig
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
sites I thank you for the question I
 
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
would have to defer to the Prime on that
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
for his research into if that is the
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:32.790 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
represent power thank you Mr chair I
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
have a processed question I I understand
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
that the prime sponsor is not here and
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
my question is probably better directed
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
to the prime um could you recommend or
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
provide guidance as to how this
 
00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
committee can ask questions of the Prime
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh at 9:37 the prime said
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
walking over from the garage now so he
 
00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
should be here momentarily would you
 
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:00.570 align:start position:0%
like me to
 
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.990 align:start position:0%
like me to
[Laughter]

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
Vamp the 1961 Yankees lineup consistent
 
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
no okay we're good any other questions
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
for representative major seeing none
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for introducing in
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
the testimony we have uh one pink card
 
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
and I think by the time n is finished uh
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
here thank you Mr chair H Grace for the
 
00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:29.629 align:start position:0%
here thank you Mr chair H Grace for the
mun

00:12:29.629 --> 00:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
mun
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
Association um just to give you all a
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
slight background here um this this bill
 
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
came at the request of The molon Boro
 
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
town clerk um who worked with a number
 
00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
of other Town clerks um as the process
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
currently functions um the municipality
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
receives four copies of four paper
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
copies of an
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
application um and back when this
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
statute was originally written one copy
 
00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
would go to the the select board one to
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
the planning board one of the
 
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission and one was
 
00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839 align:start position:0%
retained by the town clerk the copy that
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
went to Dees was apparently scanned and
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
sent down there um they do that
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
regularly um given that often times uh
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
more than one member of the governing
 
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
body or the planning board want to
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
review copies of of this
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
application it's frequently the case
 
00:13:28.829 --> 00:13:28.839 align:start position:0%
that town clerks are scanning copies and
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
so this is really an attempt to help
 
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
alleviate the administrative burden at
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
the local level by ensuring the town
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
clerk doesn't have to scan the copies
 
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
anymore instead they can just have a
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
fillable PDF or whatever the format is
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
that um that Dees has for this that
 
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
someone fills out
 
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
anyway prints out and then hands into
 
00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
the town clerk who then handles it from
 
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
there instead what will happen is they
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
will send a digital copy that the town
 
00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
clerk can distribute um as well as a
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
paper copy uh the amendment that you
 
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
will be seen clarifies
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
that the other local bodies can receive
 
00:14:15.629 --> 00:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
either paper copies or digital copies at
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
their discretion because it is clear
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
that some communities do not have the
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
capability of Distributing electronic uh
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
electronic copies and there are of
 
00:14:28.749 --> 00:14:28.759 align:start position:0%
course some board members who prefer
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
paper copies so we want to make sure
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
there was uh discretion there um uh
 
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
Additionally the amendment will clarify
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
a uh make a technical correction as you
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
may note uh the word digital and
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
electronic are used interchangeably here
 
00:14:49.949 --> 00:14:49.959 align:start position:0%
that's that's going away uh I understand
 
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
the sponsor is going to pick one of
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
those so there's no
 
00:14:57.069 --> 00:14:57.079 align:start position:0%
confusion um
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
and uh as far far as uh talking with
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
Dees about whether they were okay with
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
this process um I did speak with them
 
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
they did indicate they were okay with
 
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
this change because it would not affect
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
any affect how Dees processes any of
 
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
this paperwork this is just a local
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
change for what happens to the copies
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
that are retained at the local level I'm
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions the
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
committee may have representative
 
00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:27.079 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I I'm I'm a
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
little bit unclear so the D this the the
 
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
digital copy and the one paper copy is
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
originated and provided by whom to whom
 
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
the applicant is going to fill out the
 
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:48.759 align:start position:0%
form which is a fillable PDF if I
 
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
understand correctly they're going to
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
send a copy of that digitally to the
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
town clerk as well as provide a paper
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
copy um the the town clerk keeps a paper
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
copy now and wanted to continue to keep
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
a paper copy because there are
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
occasionally people who come in to town
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
hall and want to see the application the
 
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
abuts typically because they are noticed
 
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
for this because this is a land use
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
application um so the town clerk can
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
just hand them the paper copy so they
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
can review it or if they want a digital
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
copy they can get a digital copy it
 
00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
makes it easier for it should make it
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
EAS easier for
 
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
everyone representative
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
status thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question what's the
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
problem that this bill purports to
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
solve So currently the law requires that
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
a paper copy is four paper copies are
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
handed in to the town
 
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
clerk it is frequently the case that the
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
town clerks then have to scan those and
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
email those to Dees as well as the
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
members of the select board and the
 
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
planning board it would be easier for
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
them if they could simply have a digital
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
copy in the first place and distribute
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate I'm not sure why it was
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
originally in statute that it has to be
 
00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
paper or digital but it was so that's
 
00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:20.919 align:start position:0%
what's what's being addressed represent
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
Holland so just to
 
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
clarify excuse me so the is the town
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
clerk then submitting the uh digital
 
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
copy then to Dees or does the applicant
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
have to do that
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
separately if I understood correctly
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
from what I've been told the town clerk
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
after sign off submits that to Dees on
 
00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:42.039 align:start position:0%
behalf of the
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
applicant represent FR thank you Mr
 
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh I personally have only been involved
 
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
in a single um excavation permit and my
 
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
question is how does this bill deal with
 
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
the the large engineering or surveyor
 
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.679 --> 00:18:08.549 align:start position:0%
 
application

00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
I do not know the answer to that off the
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
head my only comment on that would I
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
would be that I don't believe that is
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
part of the change so I would say
 
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
whatever is going on now would probably
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
remain the same but repres
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative Brown shaking his head
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.630 align:start position:0%
any other questions
represent

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so yeah one of my big
 
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
issues is open data and things like that
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
so when it says um other digital format
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering um if there are what
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
requirements on that like what if um
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
what if uh whoever's having to provide
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
it decides to put it in just some
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
unreadable form
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
format so the the form is generated by
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
Dees and has to be filled out by the
 
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
applicant the reason that uh it's
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
written provided as a PDF because that's
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
what's currently used or other digital
 
00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
format because the Hope was that the
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
legislature would not have to revisit
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
this Statute in the future but would
 
00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:21.799 align:start position:0%
future proof it by allowing Dees to make
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
changes so if they change to something
 
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:26.360 align:start position:0%
other than PDF that they could do so
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher go ahead um
 
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
so uh in RSA 21 R colon 10 um it's got a
 
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
definition of um open data
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
formats uh would you be open to um
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
amending uh where it says other digital
 
00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
format to say um other open data format
 
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
as specified by um RSA 21 r10 um
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
instead or do you think um that uh or do
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
covered I I assume that Dees would use
 
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
whatever guidance already exists in
 
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
statute when generating their form I I
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
don't have an opinion other than that
 
00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.710 align:start position:0%
don't have an opinion other than that
representative

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
status like to take a step back for just
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
a moment and ask a kind of a bigger
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
picture question
 
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
um I haven't done the research so I
 
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
don't I'm just I'm asking you uh are
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
such copies of permits required under
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
different rsas for different governing
 
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
bodies in municipalities and will this
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
be a if passed would this be something
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
very different from what's prescribed in
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
other rsas that require permits to be
 
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
submitted I'm just I'm just looking for
 
00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:03.799 align:start position:0%
a reason why we're being so granular and
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
specific on this particular permitting
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
process when there are dozens of other
 
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
time for reasons that I do not know the
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
legislature decided to make this process
 
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
very specific in the statute um whereas
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
others just give discretion to
 
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
departments or to um individual
 
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities to to
 
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
create um so the attempt here was just
 
00:21:37.149 --> 00:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
by the town clerks to help them
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
internally do their process a little bit
 
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.789 align:start position:0%
internally do their process a little bit
more

00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
efficiently see no more questions thank
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony I have
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
no more pin cards uh we will go ahead
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.039 --> 00:22:02.310 align:start position:0%
 
hb152

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
okay next up we have and right on time
 
00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
kahill thank you Mr chairman members of
 
00:22:17.549 --> 00:22:17.559 align:start position:0%
the committee uh we're going to open up
 
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
the the hearing on House Bill 1218
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
relative to voting for municipal bonds
 
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
representative kahill you have the floor
 
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh please forgive my
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
eagerness it's just uh Municipal and
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
county has a soft spot for me it's where
 
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
I passed my very first bill and a couple
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
afterwards so let's keep that
 
00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:41.830 align:start position:0%
afterwards so let's keep that
going

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
um many of us I I would think the
 
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
majority of us in this room were elected
 
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
by less than 60%
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
margins and yet we vote on bills that
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
you know add or cut costs we vote on the
 
00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:03.799 align:start position:0%
budget and I think that requiring a 60%
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
threshold for the municipal bonds is is
 
00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
very high I understand it was
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
166% let's not go there but it does
 
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
impede progress that we need to make an
 
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.990 align:start position:0%
impede progress that we need to make an
Our

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
Our
 
00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.039 align:start position:0%
communities um and I have a few examples
 
00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
of uh situations where you know we
 
00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:24.039 align:start position:0%
should have as you know as my aunt
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
Regina used to say we should have you
 
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.470 align:start position:0%
Regina used to say we should have you
know

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
so as I as as I told you my most of my
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
interest in this has been with the
 
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
public schools that we we have a lot of
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
public schools in very poor condition uh
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
those of you you know you all represent
 
00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:44.919 align:start position:0%
district with schools and either they're
 
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:46.919 align:start position:0%
recently renovated or they will will
 
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
need to be renovated it's if if not now
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
with when you know
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
but uh just prior to the moratorium a
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
$23 million renovation major renovation
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
for Stevens High School up in
 
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
Claremont uh a school that was built in
 
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
1867 they got their mone's worth uh they
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
that they had a bond vote and it was one
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
vote shy of
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
60% and I I know you can always be one
 
00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:20.919 align:start position:0%
vote shy you know but that was close and
 
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
uh so they didn't that
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
failed and with that they were a 60%
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
community so they would have
 
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.590 align:start position:0%
community so they would have
received

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
um they would have received a
 
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
substantial sum to pay for that but
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
instead a couple of years later into the
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
moratorium they did a they downsized it
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
so they could you know get more people
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
on board it was far less than that what
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
the community needed and they passed it
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh for 12.6 million you know nearly half
 
00:24:59.070 --> 00:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
and they cost him $3.4 million
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know really
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
in that that's what they that's what
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
they they
 
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
spent because they they they missed out
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
on the on the state aid and they had far
 
00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:11.559 align:start position:0%
less school for the money uh the Lincoln
 
00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:15.559 align:start position:0%
acrian School in Hampton Falls six tries
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
to to renovate their uh their
 
00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:22.230 align:start position:0%
to to renovate their uh their
school

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:25:24.909 --> 00:25:24.919 align:start position:0%
and you know they cut it from 7 to 4
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
million and they got less and less for
 
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.190 align:start position:0%
million and they got less and less for
theiry

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
theiry
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
when they did that alurn and Hudson
 
00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039 align:start position:0%
there were actually a CTE School in W
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
there was a schedule uh every so often
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's your turn to get money and a
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
lot of it's Federal money uh so the
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
voters supported that that part of the
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
project and but failed to approve the
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
renovation of the high school and it
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
probably would have made a lot of
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
Economic and physical you know sense to
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
do them all at once I know that's what
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
was done in in Salem uh they had a major
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
High School renovation they got uh the
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
they had the CTE rolled into it as did
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
do it makes a big difference you don't
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
have to bust people to some other place
 
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
for those Career Technical education and
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
you had the federal money so we can't
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
all have CTE schools you know that we
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
don't but they do serve an important
 
00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:25.110 align:start position:0%
don't but they do serve an important
role

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
um so I have here you know as you know
 
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
we we had 17 applications for building
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
Aid it reopened and now we're funding
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
some of them and we funded three so the
 
00:26:36.799 --> 00:26:37.630 align:start position:0%
some of them and we funded three so the
other

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:37.640 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
14 on this list
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
here and I think some of these some of
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
these Community names will be familiar
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
to you uh Amherst has two projects
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
Barnstead haris Brookline has two
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
colbrook has two conquer Derry has two
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
Hamstead has a project har Brook line
 
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
there's more uh Hudson kage Litchfield
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
Monroe Plymouth and there's uh just
 
00:27:08.389 --> 00:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
under 8,000 students enrolled in those
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
schools and they were kind of waiting
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
for their communities to be able to pass
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
a warrant
 
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
article uh so that they will have a
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
better quality education uh young
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
families will want to move there raise
 
00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
their children work and live in the
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
communities maybe maybe own a start a
 
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
business I know that in New Market the
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
you know the word was um the elementary
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
school's okay but once your kid goes you
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
want to leave town before you before
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
they got to the sixth grade in the other
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
building which you know was built in in
 
00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:42.990 align:start position:0%
building which you know was built in in
uh

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
1925 and had a few additions to it so
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
you know we we need to make the
 
00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:50.360 align:start position:0%
Investments I know you know it's like U
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
it's like pulling teeth you know getting
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
we we did something a few years ago to
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
protect the loons we took out the the
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
lead tackle but we still haven't got the
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
fish hooks out of our pockets and I I I
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
think that a simple majority like the
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
way that we're elected might be a way to
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
enable the communities to pass these
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
Warren articles a little sooner uh
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
probably a little cheaper than than
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
dragging out and waiting and waiting for
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
construction cost to rise so that is why
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
I brought this bill to you
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
today thank you are you open to
 
00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:26.519 align:start position:0%
questions represent are there any
 
00:28:26.519 --> 00:28:30.350 align:start position:0%
questions represent are there any
questions

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.669 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:38.519 align:start position:0%
understand the importance of what you're
 
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
talking about um exitor had a 16 point
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
something million police station that we
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
were looking for and it failed by six
 
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
votes and we don't have a charter so
 
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's a three- fifths
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
requirement um putting it up again now
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
the price is higher as you explained but
 
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
but the question that came to me is are
 
00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
we not
 
00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.310 align:start position:0%
we not
um

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh I can't think of the word
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
um ex or or denying the voters an
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
opportunity to say
 
00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:18.519 align:start position:0%
no uh thank you for the question I I
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
think what we would do if we had a
 
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:23.240 align:start position:0%
simple majority we'd be encouraging
 
00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:25.799 align:start position:0%
voters on both sides of the issue to
 
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
learn more about the project participate
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
and to show up and vote we wouldn't be
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
saying well H they'll never pass this I
 
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
home representative
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
for your put your article because I know
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
this is a big
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
problem uh I I come from Hamstead we do
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
believe that we had a fire station
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
Edition and a police station that we
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
didn't get I think it was two times on
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
each one we ended up putting it in the
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
budget and can can you maybe uh discuss
 
00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:10.519 align:start position:0%
what happens when you have this kind of
 
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
a uh a budget uh item that's of that
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
that much value and what that does to
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
the tax rate and what are the
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
ramification for go going into the
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
budget where you don't have to have the
 
00:30:29.789 --> 00:30:29.799 align:start position:0%
two-thirds uh uh thank you uh
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
representative I'm afraid I don't have
 
00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:35.919 align:start position:0%
the the background to you know about the
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
implications what it does to this to the
 
00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:39.519 align:start position:0%
bond rating I don't think it would be
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
good but I'm just guessing because I I'm
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
not I'm not on the any of the budget
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
committee or The Count Council um so I
 
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
don't know how that what the negative is
 
00:30:52.269 --> 00:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
but I do know what it's like when you
 
00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
have these projects that need to be done
 
00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
even people may agree they need to be
 
00:30:58.269 --> 00:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
done but you're trying to find some way
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
to kick it down the road uh and the road
 
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
needs to get paved
 
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
too right if I may Mr CH follow up I
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
don't think I was clear I was trying to
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
get a reaction to you of when there is
 
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
an item that is normally bonded you go
 
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
before the the towns and you get
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
rejected because of the uh the two3
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
that's required what do you take take
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
that budget and you put it in I mean you
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
take that item you put it in your
 
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
budget you want I'm I'm trying to make a
 
00:31:38.509 --> 00:31:38.519 align:start position:0%
point that that has a
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
real strong impact on the uh tax rate
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
representative Guth do you have a is
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
there a question in there somewhere I
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
would believe I would I haven't heard it
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
yet I would believe
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
yeah uh again representative uh I I uh I
 
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
understand that you know it's probably a
 
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
bit of desperation that brings the
 
00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
community to do that and somehow or
 
00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
other the taxpayer will pay for it um
 
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
and you you can try but sooner or later
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
you have to get these things done and I
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
just like to move it a little faster
 
00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:17.799 align:start position:0%
hopefully a little cheaper and have
 
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
people buy into the process you know at
 
00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.389 align:start position:0%
people buy into the process you know at
the

00:32:21.389 --> 00:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
beginning gra out of power thank you Mr
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.509 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
question

00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:28.519 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
do you agree that a municipal bond is a
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
very serious Financial commitment it's
 
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
multi-year large amounts over the the
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
term of of the bond and it commits the
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to subsequent multi-year you
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
know Financial commitment
 
00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
so could you please explain to me and
 
00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
and therefore that's why we have a super
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
majority because it's it's it's
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
different than it's a a different level
 
00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
of spending with different um criteria
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
or not criteria but
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
terms so could you explain more clearly
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
um why then is a simple majority
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
sufficient for such a serious financial
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
obligation uh on the backs of the
 
00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh thank you representative
 
00:33:22.269 --> 00:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
for the question I agree it is
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
serious and I think the the delay that
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
we that we fre quently see leads to
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
Serious uh overages and expenses and an
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
impact on our communities where we have
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
people looking at for a place to start a
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
business or raise a family and they're
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
saying no I think I'm going to go here
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
instead I really think it's in our
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
long-term interest to to think of the
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
long-term health of our communities and
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
make these Investments and I again I
 
00:33:54.629 --> 00:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
would hope that we we would still have
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
substantial margins but falling shy of
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
60% in so many instances I I think it
 
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
it representative Hicks thank you Mr
 
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for the uh for being
 
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
here and taking this question did you
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
say your primary motivation is for um
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
communities to receive state and federal
 
00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
funding to make it easier for that is
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
that what I'm hearing from you to lower
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
the threshold to a simple
 
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
majority thank you for the question I
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
mean certainly we're we're possible you
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
know communities do pursue grants and
 
00:34:33.149 --> 00:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
and and funding from various
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
sources and sometimes I I know with the
 
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
situation with with building Aid that we
 
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
have now for schools uh the voters don't
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
know if they're going to get building
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
Aid or not well we knew during the
 
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
moratorium didn't we but we but we don't
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
know now whether we'll be getting that
 
00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:49.079 align:start position:0%
and I that's another issue we've been
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
working on but um certainly uh reducing
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
costs getting the getting the best bang
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
for your buck that that's the duty that
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
the members of the school board Town
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
Council budget committee and our
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities have and and I know that
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
they they're delegated to review these
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
these projects and very often they come
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
through it with a unanimous vote and
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
still the community falls short of
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
60% representative kahill for
 
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.230 align:start position:0%
60% representative kahill for
representative

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
kahill thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question would you believe
 
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
that if
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
had passed a bond a few years ago to
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
pave our destroyed roads it would have
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
been cheaper for us to have done it then
 
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
than it would be now representative
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
kahill I do believe that thank you for
 
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
T thank you Mr
 
00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.589 align:start position:0%
T thank you Mr
chair

00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:52.599 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
um hypothetically you're looking
 
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.349 align:start position:0%
um hypothetically you're looking
to

00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to narrow this down
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
um to
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
circumvent the super Bond requirement or
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
super vote on a
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
bond um which is in
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
law um how would that so if you expand
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
that um we have a bill come up on the
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
floor that uh
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
didn't get the super majority at at chcr
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
or something like
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm hearing that oh we didn't get
 
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
it but we still want it so we'll just
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
vote it in the regular budget into the
 
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
sense thank you I didn't hear a question
 
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
there either representative kahill
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
so representative y Ella thank you thank
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question um do you
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
think that it is prudent for the
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um money to
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
utilize um the saving account options
 
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
that uh as far as um Expendable trusts
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
and all of that um which Acure AC aure
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
interest instead of paying additional
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
money um uh and saving for those
 
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
expenditures like the roads and and
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
school things instead of um on the back
 
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
end paying more because of interest uh
 
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
through bonds and so the the um state is
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
inent essentially incentivizing savings
 
00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
instead of um loans uh through this
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
simple majority
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
option thank you representative for the
 
00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
the communities of municipalities do put
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
aside money with voter approval for you
 
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
know 200,000 here for this and that they
 
00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
do set it aside for maintenance and and
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
and things as part of their it's another
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
article on on the budget many times uh
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
and they certainly do use those funds to
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount that we need to
 
00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
bond and uh I I think this is a separate
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
issue where we're not we're
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh we're asking the communities we're
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
giving the communities the option to
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
bond Less in the long run because if we
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
don't drag our feet and wait until who
 
00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
knows what happens we we do it when we
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
need it rather than saving for we I
 
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
think it's impractical to say we're
 
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
going to save up uh in my case $39
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
million before we build the school we'll
 
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
have generations of
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
people you know will have gone wouldn't
 
00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we can't write off the
 
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
mortgage interest thank you
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
representative seeing no further
 
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony I
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
have no other pink cards uh I have a
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
blue sheet with nobody signed in for it
 
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
for or against so with that we will
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on hb1 1218 we're in a
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
rare situation we're actually ahead of
 
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
our time so I'm going to use yeah I know
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
um had a schedule I should say uh going
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
to use this time since most of us just F
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
everybody's here couple qu couple points
 
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
um you might have you did receive a
 
00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:38.119 align:start position:0%
email from me regarding the possibility
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
of executing three bills on Thursday I
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
would um that those may or may not go so
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
be pay very careful attention on the
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
house floor on Thursday because that's
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
where that announcement would have to
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
come from to make everything
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
legal um now we talked about this at at
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
the beginning of last
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
week when you hey Richard um
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative Brown I'm sorry could you
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.349 --> 00:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
somebody when we hear testimony from
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
those giving the testimony we need to
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
only the only thing we're supposed to be
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
doing is asking questions questions
 
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
regarding their testimony not going off
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
into the Weeds on different uh
 
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
things even slightly related but we we
 
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
need to keep it focused on what they say
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing we talked about last
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
week is the W you believes are not
 
00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
something here when we get to Executive
 
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
sessions that's where we Talk Amongst
 
00:40:56.349 --> 00:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
ourselves in committee about what we
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
believe and make our points there not
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
here uh
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
lastly when you have a
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
question try to have
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
it succinct and to the point be ready to
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
When I Call On you to have that question
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
so when we ask it it's quick and we can
 
00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
there questions on any of
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
that seeing none our next uh hearing
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
starts at
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.240 --> 00:50:05.910 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:58.069 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
minute oh she's making a way to her seat
 
00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:18.309 align:start position:0%
minute oh she's making a way to her seat
okay

00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.589 --> 00:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
Gavin okay it's 10:20 we're going to go
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
ahead and open up the next uh hearing on
 
00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
HB 11:25 relative to requiring public
 
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
notice and comment at all County
 
00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:31.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioner and delegation meetings
 
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative buroughs Prime sponsor
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
mic thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
having me here I'm Anita burrow Carol to
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
I'm one of the um sponsors of this bill
 
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
um this is a pretty simple it's a
 
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan Bill and it basically uh is
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
is uh promoting that there be
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
requirement for public notice and
 
00:52:00.789 --> 00:52:00.799 align:start position:0%
comment at all County Commissioner and
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
delegation meetings so the current law
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
states that public comment in a county
 
00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner delegation meeting is a
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
privilege but not a right and I believe
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
that it should be both a that it should
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
be both a privilege and a
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
right um and this bill was filed after a
 
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
scenario that I witness um in Carol
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
County and I just want to tell you this
 
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
short story um a citizen was concerned
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
about the Financial Health of um our
 
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
nursing home there was a lot of
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
controversy there was a lot of articles
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
in the paper so he call he's a
 
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
healthcare consultant and he understood
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
how to analyze financial statements he
 
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
did this for a living so um he went on
 
00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
the zoom to express his concern and ask
 
00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
a question and he was recognized to
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
speak he then proceeded to express his
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
concern about the health of the nursing
 
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
home financially the commissioner tried
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
to give reassurance that um that the
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
nursing home was was doing well she said
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
the nursing home was just fine and he
 
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
very respectfully said Madam Madam chair
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
chairman I respectfully degree uh
 
00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
disagree because I read financial
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
statements for a living and the at this
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
juncture the commissioner repeatedly
 
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
gaveled uh for this consultant to stop
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
talking as he did and I'm going to say
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
at this juncture for um transparency
 
00:53:22.109 --> 00:53:22.119 align:start position:0%
this gentleman was my husband um but I
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
would have I would have I would have uh
 
00:53:26.349 --> 00:53:26.359 align:start position:0%
put forth this whether it was him or
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
somebody else and and at the next
 
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:31.480 align:start position:0%
meeting another commissioner chastised
 
00:53:32.829 --> 00:53:32.839 align:start position:0%
this man mentioned that he was my
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
husband for his rude behavior and no
 
00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
time was he rude um and he again
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
reiterated that public comment is a
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
privilege and not a right now what are
 
00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:44.799 align:start position:0%
the key highlights of the bill public
 
00:53:46.829 --> 00:53:46.839 align:start position:0%
comment is either written comment
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
addressed to the commission or
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
delegation and delivered prior to a
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
meeting each person shall be granted at
 
00:53:54.789 --> 00:53:54.799 align:start position:0%
least three minutes to speak in person
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
and remote spoken comment is allowed and
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
there should be a sign in process for
 
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
people wishing to speak um so that we
 
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
know that that they're there and that
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
they they have signed up and they they
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
want to be recognized
 
00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:10.839 align:start position:0%
um and that the commissioner delegation
 
00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
does have the right to set up a
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
procedure for recognizing people who are
 
00:54:17.789 --> 00:54:17.799 align:start position:0%
on remotely and every person with a card
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
or on the zoom should be allowed to
 
00:54:22.589 --> 00:54:22.599 align:start position:0%
speak and all meetings shall be open to
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
the public whether in person telephone
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
or by computer
 
00:54:28.349 --> 00:54:28.359 align:start position:0%
if the charter of any city or town or
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines or rules of any public body
 
00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
require a broader access to broader
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
public access to official meetings and
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
Records such guidelines or Rules of
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
Order take presidents over this
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
legislation again as I said before this
 
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
bill is straightforward and bipartisan
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
by enabling public comment citizens can
 
00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
bring a spotlight on any issue and show
 
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
elected officials that their pass may
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
not be the best one for their
 
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
constituents in a democracy the
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
government should serve the people and
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
not vice versa it is CR critically
 
00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
important that citizens participate so
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
that the government and our elected PE
 
00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
our elected officials are serving the
 
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
people therefore it's essential that we
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
create the expectation that people are
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to speak even if there is a
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
disagreement with our elected officials
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and happy to take any
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative for
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
the testimony Representatives uh power
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:26.559 align:start position:0%
taking my question and providing your um
 
00:55:28.349 --> 00:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
testimony so at the beginning of your
 
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
testimony I heard you say that the the
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
gentleman in your example that you cited
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
had um I guess approached well he was on
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
Zoom he was on Zoom so you started off
 
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
and you you mentioned that he had asked
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
a question and then he proceeded to
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
provide I mischaracterized that he did
 
00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
not ask a question because you can't ask
 
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
a question in those meetings so I
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
mischaracterized it he made a statement
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
he made a statement and at which which
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
point he was gaved okay so thank you but
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
I I'll continue on okay I'm sorry didn't
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
mean to interrupt you thank you for
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
clarifying that because that's where I'm
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
going so just then to to be
 
00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
clear it's my understanding that this
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
bill as written you don't intend for the
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
the public providing input or comment to
 
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
be asking questions because clearly
 
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
public comment or input is not a back
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
and forth It's not a place or the time
 
00:56:29.789 --> 00:56:29.799 align:start position:0%
for the public to be asking questions
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
and expecting answers it it is just to
 
00:56:36.029 --> 00:56:36.039 align:start position:0%
provide commentary is that correct dis
 
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
agreed and I misspoke um I misspoke I
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
was speaking too
 
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.309 --> 00:56:47.319 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
yel thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
meetings uh would not would all benefit
 
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
from the same level of openness to the
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
public and having public comments
 
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
so why if any should should
 
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh County Commissioners or or the that
 
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
delegation um be specified out or should
 
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
it be for everyone um I'm going to be
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
really Frank I was advised that this it
 
00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
would be be it would have better chance
 
00:57:29.069 --> 00:57:29.079 align:start position:0%
of Passage doing this way and I think
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
there also if we included local meetings
 
00:57:32.589 --> 00:57:32.599 align:start position:0%
I think that there would have been push
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
back about local control and I think
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
that was the you know that was the
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:42.029 --> 00:57:42.039 align:start position:0%
this F the questions representative
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:57:50.829 --> 00:57:50.839 align:start position:0%
um it's interesting uh I have a couple
 
00:57:56.589 --> 00:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
matters but I'll just do one Mr chair um
 
00:57:58.349 --> 00:57:58.359 align:start position:0%
the posting of the meeting I understand
 
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:00.440 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be on the website and
 
00:58:02.349 --> 00:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
currently it's uh they're sent out to
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
all the delegates when there's a a
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
delegation meeting um but if in the
 
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
entrance of
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
transparency wouldn't it
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
be uh better to require be posted in all
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
towns because like for example in my
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
County um the county building is really
 
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
not accessible even in the town it's in
 
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
and so I was I my thought is would it be
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
you know within this transparency and
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
posting to require to be posted in two
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
places in each Town I'd be totally
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
supportive that that because we do we I
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
get a lot of calls from people you know
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
how do I find out when the meeting's
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
happening I really want to be there
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
when's this issue going to be spoken
 
00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:48.200 align:start position:0%
about so I I would be totally supportive
 
00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:51.710 align:start position:0%
about so I I would be totally supportive
of

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
that further
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.589 align:start position:0%
that further
questions

00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
sorry represent Gilman that's okay it's
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
not really a follow-up so I want to do a
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
second question the other is um a person
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
that wants to ask uh talk in public
 
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:09.640 align:start position:0%
comment you ask uh that they're required
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
to give their name and as printed on the
 
00:59:15.309 --> 00:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
driver's license or ID for
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
identification but they're not required
 
00:59:20.109 --> 00:59:20.119 align:start position:0%
to provide any further personal
 
00:59:22.349 --> 00:59:22.359 align:start position:0%
information um at my select board
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
meetings we ask a person that's from
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
without our from uh without our town
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
from you know surrounding town or city
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
um to identify that and then by
 
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
consensus the board agrees to let this
 
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
person be heard um you know hardly ever
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
say no but I'm wondering if we need to
 
00:59:45.309 --> 00:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
also add the the words in there that um
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
about there be consensus to allow
 
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
somebody from outside the county oh
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
county I I think that would be
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable but not not for somebody who
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
lives in the county and in terms of
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
identification frankly Carol County is
 
01:00:03.029 --> 01:00:03.039 align:start position:0%
pretty small most people know each other
 
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
you know we know you know it's very rare
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
that somebody comes in that somebody
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't know that person but I think it
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
would be reasonable I mean we do get New
 
01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire some hearings there are more
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
people from out of state than in state
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
wanting to test testify and that can be
 
01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.789 align:start position:0%
wanting to test testify and that can be
problematic

01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
y further questions representative Brown
 
01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative burough I have a kind of
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
a question to you in regard to
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative Gilmore's question to you
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
and regard to um notification if you
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
were to revise the bill to say something
 
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
along the lines that it would be
 
01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:43.720 align:start position:0%
required to be posted in the towns of
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
the county that whether or not that
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
would be uh problematic in regard to the
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
to the posting time so you could post it
 
01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
in let's say the county and then if the
 
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
towns don't get it all posted in an
 
01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate time period then that could
 
01:00:59.710 --> 01:00:59.720 align:start position:0%
be an issue for that do you feel that
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
could be a problem or how do you feel
 
01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:02.710 align:start position:0%
could be a problem or how do you feel
about

01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
that again I I actually don't know
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
offand what the what the time period
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
requirement is for both commission and
 
01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
delegation meanings what the period of
 
01:01:14.589 --> 01:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
time is so you know maybe the language
 
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
would be something to the effect of to
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
their best ability you know it could be
 
01:01:21.789 --> 01:01:21.799 align:start position:0%
you know it could be like for example
 
01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:23.839 align:start position:0%
the Conway Daily Sun has an event column
 
01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
they could post it there so I mean I
 
01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:27.160 align:start position:0%
think there are a lot of ways to go
 
01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:29.720 align:start position:0%
there are you know towns have um online
 
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
forms I I think there are ways to do it
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
and do it quickly but you know I I I
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
think that's something that needs to be
 
01:01:38.029 --> 01:01:38.039 align:start position:0%
looked at thank you
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
y representative
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
for taking another question so with
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
regards to um the public comment and in
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
here in the bill under Section Roman
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
numeral 4 that there's the person will
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
fill out a card they won't just stating
 
01:02:00.269 --> 01:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
their name my question is how will what
 
01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
is the how can their residency within
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
the county be be validated or determined
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
if they're only giving their name when
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
you had established that in order to
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
give the public comment the person must
 
01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
be a resident of the
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
county I appreciate the question I'm
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
just thinking ahead and I'm thinking of
 
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
another scenario where would have
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
somebody from another County let's say
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
that there's an issue going on in Carol
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
County that um that that I'm just going
 
01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
to that a town in um Rochester had this
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
similar situation which actually is true
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
they had some similar issues with n
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
Nursing Home in that scenario I would
 
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
think that it would be not a bad idea to
 
01:02:47.269 --> 01:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
let that person speak if there was
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
relevancy to their
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
experience follow up thank you
 
01:02:55.269 --> 01:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
representative for for that response
 
01:02:58.029 --> 01:02:58.039 align:start position:0%
like what I'm getting at is would it
 
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
make sense to have an amendment where
 
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
the person would provide identification
 
01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
supplying their name and like the town
 
01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
so that way the people running in the
 
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
meeting can can know is this person
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
within the county where they can provide
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
the input without any extra consensus
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
and if they're outside of the county
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
then that that is known and then they
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
can people running the meeting can go
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
from there you see what I'm saying yes I
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
do see what you're saying I my response
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
to that to be I would like to see that
 
01:03:32.029 --> 01:03:32.039 align:start position:0%
something that the county decides how to
 
01:03:34.349 --> 01:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
handle that again because our County as
 
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
I said is small it's very different than
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
some of the places in Nash Manchester
 
01:03:40.029 --> 01:03:40.039 align:start position:0%
where you don't know who's walking in
 
01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
the door so you know I was coming in
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
with that framework so I think it might
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.069 --> 01:03:51.079 align:start position:0%
county is your hand up representative
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
Elward Elward
 
01:03:53.279 --> 01:03:55.510 align:start position:0%
Elward Elward
representative

01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:57.069 --> 01:03:57.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question um do you think as a
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
matter of pract
 
01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
practicality that rather than trying to
 
01:04:08.109 --> 01:04:08.119 align:start position:0%
legislate Town involvement on these
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
postings that the county commissioner
 
01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
just encouraged the town to post a link
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
to the County
 
01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.309 align:start position:0%
to the County
website

01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
website
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
um I just again in my experience I just
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
see too many people who want to have a
 
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
say in County government they don't even
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
know that there's a County website and
 
01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
so maybe there's also an education facet
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
to it but I do think you know making a
 
01:04:36.029 --> 01:04:36.039 align:start position:0%
posting in the local paper or something
 
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
like that there's a section you don't
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
even have to pay for it it's events um I
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
I think that would be really helpful
 
01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.990 align:start position:0%
I think that would be really helpful
thank

01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
you further
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
questions see and I do have a couple
 
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative um the first one I just
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
want to clarify
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
is it your intention for this bill that
 
01:04:59.269 --> 01:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
only individuals from the county be
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to speak under this section no
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
as I as I just said I think there are
 
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
scenarios where it's appropriate and I
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
think there are scenarios when it's not
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate okay thank you um on line
 
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.990 align:start position:0%
appropriate okay thank you um on line
number

01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
10 um you have the words penalty
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
retribution or disrespect could you
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
define for me let's just pick one of
 
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
them let's pick disrespect respect and
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
Define what that is well I think the
 
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
example I just gave you with my husband
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
showed contempt and disrespect um for
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
somebody who was just trying to make a
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
comment and uh follow up for the
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
chairman who who's going to make that
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
who's going to decide whether it's
 
01:05:49.549 --> 01:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
disrespect retribution or penalty that
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
is a very good question that is a very
 
01:05:55.789 --> 01:05:55.799 align:start position:0%
good question and my final comment on
 
01:05:59.950 --> 01:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
that line or question would be and after
 
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
it's decided who will make that
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
decision uh what is the remedy for
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
that well I guess in in in let's just
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
let's just say the example that I gave
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
this person being gaveled I think the
 
01:06:16.109 --> 01:06:16.119 align:start position:0%
remedy for that would be to allow them
 
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
to come back and speak and finish what
 
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
they were
 
01:06:20.829 --> 01:06:20.839 align:start position:0%
saying okay thank you very much
 
01:06:20.839 --> 01:06:21.990 align:start position:0%
saying okay thank you very much
representa

01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
representa
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
sis thank you Mr chair and thank thank
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
question uh in um section two of the
 
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
bill on line nine it says any
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
person shall be permitted but then it
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
goes down and limits that to someone
 
01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:44.799 align:start position:0%
with a valid ID I would you be amendable
 
01:06:48.269 --> 01:06:48.279 align:start position:0%
to amending that since it says any
 
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
person should be any person okay what
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
line are you on please first of all I'm
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
online nine okay which states any person
 
01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
shall be permitted goes on and then uh
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
it's lines 22 through through uh 23 I
 
01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
believe person shall be required to give
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
their name as printed on their driver's
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
license I I'm just thinking that those
 
01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
two things cancel each other out by
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
saying any person if it's any person
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
it's any person and if it's a public
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
meeting for example and and I apologize
 
01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:31.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chair this may not sound like a
 
01:07:33.269 --> 01:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
question but it is a
 
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
question in our city council meetings in
 
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
Lebanon where we have Wards and we have
 
01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
public comment periods we ask people to
 
01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
State their name and what Ward they live
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
in but there's no requirement that they
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
show any
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
identification so I'm asking would you
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
be amendable to absolutely the section
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
requires that AB I I think they you know
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
it's every county is so different it's
 
01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
just so different but yes I'd be amable
 
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:10.029 --> 01:08:10.039 align:start position:0%
that further comments or question or
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
questions no comments seeing none thank
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%

01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
again nobody signed in in for or
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
against and I have no more pin cards so
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
hb125 boy the chairman has gone the off
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
done the opposite
 
01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:35.480 align:start position:0%
today we're too far ahead all right well
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.799 --> 01:30:28.470 align:start position:0%
 
11

01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:50.840 --> 01:32:06.229 align:start position:0%
 
going

01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%

okay folks we're going to get going
 
01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:11.990 align:start position:0%
okay folks we're going to get going

01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
here okay we're going to go ahead and
 
01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
open up the public hearing on HB 1242
 
01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
relative to establishment of a
 
01:32:23.229 --> 01:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
countywide Communications District
 
01:32:25.229 --> 01:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
and representative Howard welcome to
 
01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County you're up thank you
 
01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you fellow
 
01:32:31.310 --> 01:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
representatives for having me today uh I
 
01:32:33.790 --> 01:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
know that we hear this a lot but HB 1242
 
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
is fairly straightforward in its
 
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
language uh in that it enables counties
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
to establish Communications districts
 
01:32:42.430 --> 01:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are unaware of what
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
Communications districts are under RSA
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
53- G they operate as a service provider
 
01:32:50.109 --> 01:32:50.119 align:start position:0%
by creating Partnerships with a
 
01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
corporate body for the primary purpose
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
of establishing a communication District
 
01:32:59.109 --> 01:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh or a Broadband Network my bad uh this
 
01:33:00.669 --> 01:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
will not change the operations of
 
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
current Communications districts and
 
01:33:04.510 --> 01:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
will only make the process of
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
establishing a district easier these
 
01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
Partnerships are great but not many
 
01:33:11.109 --> 01:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities are taking advantage of
 
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
this wonderful system because its
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
economies of scale are geared more
 
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
towards a county level operation like
 
01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
what they have done with the Carroll
 
01:33:22.350 --> 01:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
County communications District the need
 
01:33:24.830 --> 01:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
for each town to pass a warrant article
 
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
makes establishment unnecessarily
 
01:33:30.149 --> 01:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
lengthy and a complex process that HB
 
01:33:30.159 --> 01:33:31.470 align:start position:0%
lengthy and a complex process that HB
1242

01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
1242
 
01:33:33.629 --> 01:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
fixes uh while still giving
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities the final say with the
 
01:33:38.189 --> 01:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
included opt out in the bill I hope that
 
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
you'll join me in supporting this
 
01:33:42.270 --> 01:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation to give counties
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
the choice as well as towns uh how they
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
want to approach Broadband in the future
 
01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:50.550 align:start position:0%
want to approach Broadband in the future
thank

01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:52.830 --> 01:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony stand
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
repr representative yella thank you
 
01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question um in
 
01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
your testimony you mentioned Carol
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
County has a communication District
 
01:34:16.669 --> 01:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
um so this bill is allowing counties to
 
01:34:19.390 --> 01:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
have a communication District so I guess
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
my question is um if a communication
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
district for a County already exists
 
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
then why is this legislation necessary
 
01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question so under the
 
01:34:33.790 --> 01:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
current um rsas we have uh establishment
 
01:34:35.709 --> 01:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
through individual towns passing the
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
warrant article so each Town needs to uh
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
band together and basically on an
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
individual basis go and establish this
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh this would change that by instead of
 
01:34:49.149 --> 01:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
trying to make this a proactive process
 
01:34:52.109 --> 01:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
amongst every town if a County or a
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
group of towns want to create a
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
Communications District rather than
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
having uh to go through each of the
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
towns it would be easier to just allow
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
the county to create a referendum and it
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
still allows for the opt out so if towns
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
do not want to participate uh like the
 
01:35:09.790 --> 01:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
town of wolfboro is not a part of the
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
communications District up in Caroll
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
participate representative
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'm a little
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
confused because um as you stated
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
typically um
 
01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
districts are formed for a specific
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
purpose in that the towns or
 
01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities interested come together
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
to form that that district and as you
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
stated in your testimony Carol County
 
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
has a Communications District district
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
which was formed by that procedure town
 
01:35:53.550 --> 01:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
coming together creating the
 
01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:55.669 align:start position:0%
coming together creating the
communications

01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
communications
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
District this bill as written is it true
 
01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
that it's to do the inverse process
 
01:36:07.149 --> 01:36:07.159 align:start position:0%
where the district would be
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
Communications countywide communication
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
District would be established and then
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
towns would join and and I don't
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
understand I don't see there's still a
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
process by which the towns need to
 
01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
join or say I don't want to join so I
 
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
don't really see how this bill is
 
01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
solving anything so under the
 
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
rsas um uh
 
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.870 align:start position:0%
rsas um uh
for

01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
establishment you have to go through a
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
planning committee and basically this
 
01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
would allow the county to establish a
 
01:36:44.189 --> 01:36:44.199 align:start position:0%
planning committee so that they can move
 
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
forward with the process because the
 
01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
corporate body is separate from the
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
county they're not they're not linked
 
01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
necessarily it just allows the inverse
 
01:36:54.669 --> 01:36:54.679 align:start position:0%
to happen because it's a lot easier for
 
01:36:57.629 --> 01:36:57.639 align:start position:0%
the towns to propose a referendum uh
 
01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
like this is a fairly big issue uh up in
 
01:37:04.030 --> 01:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
the north country and so for a number of
 
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
towns up there they may want to say to
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
their County government we would like to
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
propose a referendum to the other towns
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
rather than having to go to each select
 
01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
board and convince them to be a part of
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
this so it would instead propose uh that
 
01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:21.910 align:start position:0%
this so it would instead propose uh that
as

01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh rather to trying to get people to
 
01:37:26.189 --> 01:37:26.199 align:start position:0%
join together there's only a handful of
 
01:37:27.790 --> 01:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
districts in the entire State because
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're incredibly difficult to set up
 
01:37:32.669 --> 01:37:32.679 align:start position:0%
Carol County is kind of the exception uh
 
01:37:34.109 --> 01:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
they they've done a really good job up
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
there and I think that it would be great
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
formed representative majori thank you
 
01:37:51.229 --> 01:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
my question I wonder then if I
 
01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly if there
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
should be language included in the
 
01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
RSA that that um that gives the the
 
01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
county the warrant article are you are
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
you suggesting that the warrant article
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
has to then go to each community on
 
01:38:11.470 --> 01:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
behalf of the county to State what it
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
wants to do and and the and the limits
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
to that maybe I misunderstood so uh
 
01:38:21.149 --> 01:38:21.159 align:start position:0%
basically uh under the way that the uh
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
languages written uh let me hold up one
 
01:38:27.589 --> 01:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
second um it would allow governing
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
bodies uh of municipalities to uh kind
 
01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
of reject whatever is proposed but um it
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
may need a little bit of tweaking in
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
some of the language and I'd be
 
01:38:43.629 --> 01:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
definitely willing to work with you on
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
that represent stavis thank you Mr chair
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
01:38:52.830 --> 01:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
have County Commissioners come to you
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
and requested this uh so actually the uh
 
01:38:58.750 --> 01:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
Association of counties has unanimously
 
01:39:02.350 --> 01:39:02.360 align:start position:0%
voted to support this bill uh and it it
 
01:39:04.149 --> 01:39:04.159 align:start position:0%
it is something that I've discussed with
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:12.189 --> 01:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
Commissioners representative
 
01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman for taking
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
my question and thank you for being here
 
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't there be an economic uh
 
01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:21.910 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't there be an economic uh
scale

01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
scale
 
01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
um effect
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness with this bill that would
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
save money for all the towns within the
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
district as well as time yes uh exactly
 
01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of the primary reason
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:43.229 --> 01:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
bill further
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.790 align:start position:0%

chairman I don't need the promotion
 
01:40:18.189 --> 01:40:18.199 align:start position:0%
today but thank you very much U my name
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
is Kate Horan I am here on behalf of the
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of counties
 
01:40:24.910 --> 01:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
which is all your elected and appointed
 
01:40:27.229 --> 01:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
officials at County government level um
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
I in my haste this morning in the office
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
I forgot my hard copies but all in your
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
inboxes are a copy of the association's
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
letter um so you do have that and I will
 
01:40:38.910 --> 01:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
drop hard copies off with the committee
 
01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
assistant later today just so you can
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
have them um this uh as representative
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
Howard said the association is in
 
01:40:48.109 --> 01:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
support of this bill we see it as a way
 
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
for communication districts uh to be set
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
set up uh more efficiently and at less
 
01:40:58.589 --> 01:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
cost um it is an an optin option so if a
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
town decides that they don't want to or
 
01:41:02.669 --> 01:41:02.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it's an opt out option so if
 
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
towns don't want to participate they
 
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
don't have to um but it we do see it as
 
01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
a benefit for some of our more Northern
 
01:41:11.589 --> 01:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
counties that are still on dialup
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
service to expand their Broadband uh
 
01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
capacities and planning as they move
 
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
through it could also serve as a
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
Communication Center for both
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
constituents and the internet service
 
01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
provider that is involved with the
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
communications District um with that I
 
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
will close my testimony I am not a
 
01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
Communications District expert but I
 
01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
will do my best to answer any questions
 
01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
that you
 
01:41:35.709 --> 01:41:35.719 align:start position:0%
have okay thank you any questions
 
01:41:35.719 --> 01:41:37.510 align:start position:0%
have okay thank you any questions
representative

01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you for the uh
 
01:41:44.669 --> 01:41:44.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take uh ask this question
 
01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
um it says on line 12 and 13 that the
 
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
governing body
 
01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
um is able to exclude themselves and
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's um I assume that means that that
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's not going to the voters to decide
 
01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not they want to be part of
 
01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
this um District or not
 
01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
um how what is
 
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
the logic of not going to the voters
 
01:42:16.350 --> 01:42:16.360 align:start position:0%
instead of so I did I did not write this
 
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
language so that would probably be a
 
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
more appropriate question for
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative Howard but it will it
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
depends upon how the town is set up
 
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
right and what form of government are
 
01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
they an sb2 town are they a town meeting
 
01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
town because I know the ways that they
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh opt in and opt out of things are
 
01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
handled differently in those different
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
towns but I would I would direct you to
 
01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
representative Howard to okay thank you
 
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
but if you wanted to change that
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
language to send it to the voters I
 
01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
that further questions repres uh
 
01:42:50.159 --> 01:42:53.870 align:start position:0%
that further questions repres uh
representative

01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
Solace thank you Mr chairman and thanks
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
01:43:01.470 --> 01:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
question if there's a financial
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
advantage of a county doing this rather
 
01:43:08.109 --> 01:43:08.119 align:start position:0%
than the individual
 
01:43:10.830 --> 01:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
towns why wouldn't we go all the way and
 
01:43:14.189 --> 01:43:14.199 align:start position:0%
have a Statewide Communications
 
01:43:16.109 --> 01:43:16.119 align:start position:0%
District thank you for the question
 
01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
representative lales um I think that's
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
something you should discuss as a
 
01:43:21.629 --> 01:43:21.639 align:start position:0%
committee but I would also point out
 
01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
that I tell you all very frequently that
 
01:43:25.390 --> 01:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
there are 10 counties and each County
 
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
does things 10 different ways um and
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
there are different needs at Coos than
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
there are in Hillsboro and Rockingham
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
just based on their infrastructure so I
 
01:43:37.390 --> 01:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
think the countywide model is a good
 
01:43:40.149 --> 01:43:40.159 align:start position:0%
model because it allows counties who are
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
already working together with their
 
01:43:44.350 --> 01:43:44.360 align:start position:0%

01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
county follow uh go ahead is there
 
01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
anything that would
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
prohibit various counties perhaps
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro and Rockingham or Hillsboro
 
01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
Rockingham and marac could go together
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
is there anything to prohibit that from
 
01:44:11.709 --> 01:44:11.719 align:start position:0%
happening the way I read this language
 
01:44:15.390 --> 01:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
you further questions represent
 
01:44:19.599 --> 01:44:21.709 align:start position:0%
you further questions represent
St

01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
St
 
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:44:26.430 --> 01:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
taking this question if I can get rid of
 
01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
the frog in my throat
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
um the question that representative
 
01:44:35.109 --> 01:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
lalis just asked about malti County in
 
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
line nine of the bill it says one
 
01:44:41.790 --> 01:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
County so in order to give an
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
affirmative answer to representative
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
lellis would that have to be changed um
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
I think because the way that I read it
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
and if this needs to be edited I'm not a
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer it could certainly be done but
 
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
the way I read it is it's two or more
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
towns or one
 
01:44:59.629 --> 01:44:59.639 align:start position:0%
County but you could add on other
 
01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
counties one County would just be the
 
01:45:03.790 --> 01:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
other counties could participate in that
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
Communications District but there would
 
01:45:10.589 --> 01:45:10.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:13.709 --> 01:45:13.719 align:start position:0%
County for the
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very
 
01:45:21.310 --> 01:45:21.320 align:start position:0%
much okay that's all the pink card I
 
01:45:25.629 --> 01:45:25.639 align:start position:0%
have um another blue signin sheet with
 
01:45:29.669 --> 01:45:29.679 align:start position:0%
nobody on it for Pro or con so with that
 
01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:32.719 align:start position:0%
we will go ahead and close the hearing
 
01:45:35.790 --> 01:45:35.800 align:start position:0%

02:03:32.830 --> 02:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
up uh good morning committee uh thank
 
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair for this opportunity uh I
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
am representative sellers I'm from
 
02:03:40.990 --> 02:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
Grafton district 18 I represent 10 towns
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
in southern Grafton
 
02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
County um
 
02:03:48.669 --> 02:03:48.679 align:start position:0%
and you're just do okay so let me just
 
02:03:50.069 --> 02:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh I have some notes that I actually
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
handed out to you folks there that a uh
 
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
constituent actually provided to me
 
02:03:57.629 --> 02:03:57.639 align:start position:0%
which was very helpful and also I'm
 
02:03:59.629 --> 02:03:59.639 align:start position:0%
somewhat aware of this uh issue and
 
02:04:01.470 --> 02:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
being in a small town we have about
 
02:04:06.510 --> 02:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
3,000 residents about 2,000 voters and
 
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
this is basically is to establish um the
 
02:04:15.069 --> 02:04:15.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity so if the town wants to
 
02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
actually if its residents of the Town
 
02:04:19.069 --> 02:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
its voters of the town want to actually
 
02:04:21.790 --> 02:04:21.800 align:start position:0%
create a conservation committee by
 
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
election that's the opportunity right
 
02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
now they're they're signed and that's
 
02:04:29.069 --> 02:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
all they can be they can be appointed or
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
assigned by the select board they don't
 
02:04:33.149 --> 02:04:33.159 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity of
 
02:04:35.189 --> 02:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
voting and therefore you know if you
 
02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
don't have that opportunity in some
 
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
cases and again it's totally up to the
 
02:04:41.069 --> 02:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
town the town doesn't have
 
02:04:43.549 --> 02:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
to uh you know they could decide that no
 
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
we don't want an elected uh conservation
 
02:04:49.229 --> 02:04:49.239 align:start position:0%
committee and which is fine but Town
 
02:04:50.750 --> 02:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
might say yeah you know what it's a good
 
02:04:52.709 --> 02:04:52.719 align:start position:0%
idea let's you know we'll bring it to
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
the voters the voters vote Yes okay from
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
then on out it's now elected so that's
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
what this is all about it's pretty
 
02:05:02.149 --> 02:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
straightforward that way and and in the
 
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
handout I gave I gave to you here this
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
there's some good reasons you know to
 
02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
have it you know and a couple reasons uh
 
02:05:12.069 --> 02:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
with not having it as well and I'm not
 
02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
going to read through them all you have
 
02:05:15.790 --> 02:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
them in front of you at this point but
 
02:05:17.790 --> 02:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
you know overall that's a couple things
 
02:05:22.109 --> 02:05:22.119 align:start position:0%
that stand out it um bullet point two uh
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
distributes centralized control of who
 
02:05:27.790 --> 02:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
serves on the conservation committee you
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
know from the select select board or
 
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
select men to the voters you know again
 
02:05:35.069 --> 02:05:35.079 align:start position:0%
giving the control back to the voters
 
02:05:38.669 --> 02:05:38.679 align:start position:0%
which is to me that's uh that's that's
 
02:05:41.069 --> 02:05:41.079 align:start position:0%
expanding what we have today instead of
 
02:05:43.549 --> 02:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
just being all right we select board we
 
02:05:46.229 --> 02:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
we voted for you and now besides running
 
02:05:48.030 --> 02:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
the whole town we also want you to run
 
02:05:50.750 --> 02:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
the conservation committee too well this
 
02:05:52.549 --> 02:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
allows the voters to say would like to
 
02:05:53.589 --> 02:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
run it as
 
02:05:56.189 --> 02:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
well all right it it would stop you know
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
in a case of uh a resident who is Maybe
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
not well-liked maybe is good for the
 
02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
committee but the select board or select
 
02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
people don't like them or her you know
 
02:06:07.950 --> 02:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
so this would actually stop that you
 
02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
know if that's the case I mean we live
 
02:06:12.549 --> 02:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
in small towns we know this happens you
 
02:06:16.030 --> 02:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
know it does happen
 
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
um the transition doesn't take you know
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take effect like you know
 
02:06:24.189 --> 02:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
that first year it can actually uh it
 
02:06:26.910 --> 02:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
can be over three years so it's not uh
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
all in the same
 
02:06:32.589 --> 02:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
year um this is no different or or very
 
02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
similar to the planning board or zoning
 
02:06:37.069 --> 02:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
board which is elected in the towns all
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
right so think of it that way you know
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
we elect our zoning of planning
 
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
boards other than that I'm available to
 
02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
take questions and uh we'll go from
 
02:06:48.750 --> 02:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
there because I'm sure there will will
 
02:06:50.350 --> 02:06:50.360 align:start position:0%
be some and I'll do my best to answer
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
what I can representative
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:06:59.189 --> 02:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question on uh
 
02:07:01.390 --> 02:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
line 15 and
 
02:07:04.229 --> 02:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
16 the selectman May remove an elected
 
02:07:07.270 --> 02:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
member for caruse after public
 
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
hearing what what are your thoughts on
 
02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
that what what is
 
02:07:16.069 --> 02:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
cause so the again this is set up the
 
02:07:18.750 --> 02:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
same exact way as the planning of Zone
 
02:07:21.629 --> 02:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
board would be so instead of having a
 
02:07:23.229 --> 02:07:23.239 align:start position:0%
different language altogether why not
 
02:07:25.549 --> 02:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
just have the same you know it's because
 
02:07:28.430 --> 02:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
now if you're going in with different um
 
02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
languages you know hey the planning
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
board does it this way and we have to do
 
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
it this way for the conservation
 
02:07:34.750 --> 02:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
committee and we have to do it this way
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
for the zoning board it would get very
 
02:07:39.149 --> 02:07:39.159 align:start position:0%
confusing and and also take up more time
 
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
on the uh select board so thank
 
02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
you rep uh representative
 
02:07:51.549 --> 02:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
Gallagher uh hi I was wondering um if
 
02:07:55.030 --> 02:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
you could tell us a bit more about the
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
motivating case for this legislation
 
02:08:00.709 --> 02:08:00.719 align:start position:0%
like what
 
02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
exactly would the um what exactly might
 
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
the harm be for having a Conservation
 
02:08:11.310 --> 02:08:11.320 align:start position:0%
Commission chosen by the current method
 
02:08:16.149 --> 02:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
that might lead a municipality to want
 
02:08:20.350 --> 02:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
to elect them instead
 
02:08:21.750 --> 02:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
so you're asking what what the harm
 
02:08:24.990 --> 02:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
would be by creating a
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
voted well by not by by not electing
 
02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
them by continuing to do things the
 
02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:31.149 align:start position:0%
them by continuing to do things the
current

02:08:31.149 --> 02:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
way well at this point here on one of
 
02:08:35.669 --> 02:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
the bullet points is uh let's say I've
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
been in town for 10 years and um maybe
 
02:08:40.109 --> 02:08:40.119 align:start position:0%
I'm very outspoken at town meeting and
 
02:08:42.189 --> 02:08:42.199 align:start position:0%
and they don't like what I say and yet I
 
02:08:43.709 --> 02:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
want to be on the conservation committee
 
02:08:46.270 --> 02:08:46.280 align:start position:0%
because I love the conservation and I
 
02:08:47.910 --> 02:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
can't get on it because the select Bo
 
02:08:50.549 --> 02:08:50.559 align:start position:0%
don't they don't like me you know so
 
02:08:53.229 --> 02:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
it's and it's like it's too bad maybe I
 
02:08:55.390 --> 02:08:55.400 align:start position:0%
maybe I have a degree in it as well and
 
02:08:57.549 --> 02:08:57.559 align:start position:0%
it's like I can't be used and therefore
 
02:08:59.709 --> 02:08:59.719 align:start position:0%
that's the harm of not having it you
 
02:09:02.069 --> 02:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
know so you keep it as it is you might
 
02:09:04.350 --> 02:09:04.360 align:start position:0%
have a good qualified person that would
 
02:09:06.750 --> 02:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
like to be on it that just can't get on
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
what representative Elward thank you Mr
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%

mentioned that the selectman May remove
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
an elected member for cause after a
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing and we know in the land
 
02:09:33.189 --> 02:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
use statutes that that is as well for a
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
planning elected planning board member
 
02:09:40.229 --> 02:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
but does not the statute um land use
 
02:09:44.109 --> 02:09:44.119 align:start position:0%
statute specify negligence Mal feasance
 
02:09:44.119 --> 02:09:45.229 align:start position:0%
statute specify negligence Mal feasance
and

02:09:45.229 --> 02:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:48.870 --> 02:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
inefficiency um as the cause for
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
removal can I answer
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman um I'm sitting here as
 
02:09:58.549 --> 02:09:58.559 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor the prime sponsor had asked
 
02:10:01.350 --> 02:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
that I that I'd be here to help answer
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
questions could I respond to that or no
 
02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
yes you may so thank you for the
 
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
question representative um this this to
 
02:10:16.149 --> 02:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
be clear this bill is enabling it's
 
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation therefore was
 
02:10:20.430 --> 02:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
signed into law it would be enabling
 
02:10:23.910 --> 02:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
statute um to answer your question here
 
02:10:28.189 --> 02:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
this um Bill to allow the Conservation
 
02:10:31.669 --> 02:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
Commission to be elected as opposed to
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
appointed appointed the language was
 
02:10:38.350 --> 02:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
taken from um the language um elsewhere
 
02:10:41.629 --> 02:10:41.639 align:start position:0%
in statute for the enabling legislation
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
to elect the planning board and so I I
 
02:10:48.270 --> 02:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
do understand it sounds like you're
 
02:10:50.310 --> 02:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
saying that in that other area of
 
02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
Statute that instead of having
 
02:10:56.510 --> 02:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
um this selectman may remove an elected
 
02:10:58.270 --> 02:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
member for
 
02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
cause I think I hear you saying that
 
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
that is expounded upon and is listed out
 
02:11:07.109 --> 02:11:07.119 align:start position:0%
negligence malfeasance and inefficiency
 
02:11:10.109 --> 02:11:10.119 align:start position:0%
so therefore um the sponsors of this
 
02:11:12.189 --> 02:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
bill would be open to an amendment to
 
02:11:15.629 --> 02:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
provide that um parallelism and clarity
 
02:11:15.639 --> 02:11:17.149 align:start position:0%
provide that um parallelism and clarity

responsibilities are of a Conservation
Commission

02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:57.119 align:start position:0%

chairman by the way I would run for
 
02:12:17.069 --> 02:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
selectman in your town if I were
 
02:12:17.079 --> 02:12:19.549 align:start position:0%
selectman in your town if I were
you

02:12:19.549 --> 02:12:19.559 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:12:19.559 --> 02:12:20.750 align:start position:0%
you
representative

02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:12:23.229 --> 02:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
kill thank you Mr chair thank you uh for
 
02:12:26.830 --> 02:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in in Raymond we
 
02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
experience some of
 
02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
the that that's the word um some of what
 
02:12:35.229 --> 02:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
you described where a person wasn't
 
02:12:36.790 --> 02:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to be on a board because they
 
02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
weren't liked by the selectman do you
 
02:12:41.149 --> 02:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
think that maybe this legislation should
 
02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
include other boards like zoning boards
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
and things like
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
that do you say think the same thing
 
02:12:49.709 --> 02:12:49.719 align:start position:0%
happens with with them well well they're
 
02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
they're right now they're elected
 
02:12:53.149 --> 02:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
according to
 
02:12:55.990 --> 02:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
statute that's already in law they
 
02:12:57.790 --> 02:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
zoning and and zoning and planing boards
 
02:13:00.990 --> 02:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
are elected according if the town wants
 
02:13:04.510 --> 02:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
them at that point I don't know if if I
 
02:13:07.470 --> 02:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
would think if someone is not liked in
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
town they probably wouldn't be liked on
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
any of the
 
02:13:13.990 --> 02:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
boards that's my point all right and and
 
02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
honestly I mean I speak out a lot at
 
02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
town meeting and say you know for could
 
02:13:21.229 --> 02:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
be budget it could be uh any uh other
 
02:13:22.990 --> 02:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
warrant article that they bring up you
 
02:13:25.229 --> 02:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
know and it could be easily enough
 
02:13:27.310 --> 02:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
myself to say well we don't want him on
 
02:13:30.589 --> 02:13:30.599 align:start position:0%
this board because he's too outspoken so
 
02:13:32.910 --> 02:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
I would be concerned that this does not
 
02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
just happen in conservation it could be
 
02:13:41.069 --> 02:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
committee are there any further
 
02:13:46.470 --> 02:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
stavis so if if you are concerned that
 
02:13:51.910 --> 02:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
it could happen on any other commission
 
02:13:54.790 --> 02:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
or Committee in a town why doesn't this
 
02:14:02.350 --> 02:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:04.830 --> 02:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
bodies uh right now the bill actually
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
focuses on the conservation committee
 
02:14:10.310 --> 02:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's it and again it's only to allow
 
02:14:12.109 --> 02:14:12.119 align:start position:0%
the people to vote if they would like to
 
02:14:14.669 --> 02:14:14.679 align:start position:0%
have an elected conservation
 
02:14:17.189 --> 02:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
committee if statue allows other
 
02:14:19.790 --> 02:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
committees to be the same way uh that
 
02:14:21.549 --> 02:14:21.559 align:start position:0%
would have to be brought up at a
 
02:14:23.910 --> 02:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
different time that's not on what I
 
02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
proposed follow up thank you Mr chair
 
02:14:28.109 --> 02:14:28.119 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking this follow-up
 
02:14:31.270 --> 02:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
question so the intent of this
 
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
bill that proposes to change change a
 
02:14:37.109 --> 02:14:37.119 align:start position:0%
significant piece of process for
 
02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities enabling or not for those
 
02:14:41.790 --> 02:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
towns that choose to do it be a major
 
02:14:45.270 --> 02:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
change is to ensure that a person who is
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
maybe not
 
02:14:49.310 --> 02:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
liked might be
 
02:14:53.189 --> 02:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
elected am I am I clear on
 
02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
that well just because you're not liked
 
02:14:57.709 --> 02:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
by the select board doesn't mean you're
 
02:15:00.549 --> 02:15:00.559 align:start position:0%
not liked by the town's people so they
 
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
could be elected because again I as I
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
stated I could have all the credentials
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
in the world that I'm an excellent
 
02:15:09.310 --> 02:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
conservationist but if you're not liked
 
02:15:14.790 --> 02:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:16.870 --> 02:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
appointed are there any further
 
02:15:21.069 --> 02:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:23.549 --> 02:15:23.559 align:start position:0%
sellers seeing none thanks for your
 
02:15:25.470 --> 02:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
testimony and now we will call since I
 
02:15:27.549 --> 02:15:27.559 align:start position:0%
have a pink card representative power I
 
02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
think in the future it' be best to do
 
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
one at a time representative power we'll
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:48.669 --> 02:15:48.679 align:start position:0%

members as a co-sponsor I appreciate the
 
02:16:12.589 --> 02:16:12.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide my testimony with
 
02:16:15.910 --> 02:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
regards to House Bill 1302 for the
 
02:16:18.270 --> 02:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
record I am representative Diane hour I
 
02:16:20.149 --> 02:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of Brookline Mason
 
02:16:22.430 --> 02:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
and Greenville in Hillsboro County
 
02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:23.430 align:start position:0%
and Greenville in Hillsboro County
District

02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
District
 
02:16:26.229 --> 02:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
36 today I would like to offer you an
 
02:16:28.669 --> 02:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
example of the inadequacies of the
 
02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
current method of appointing members to
 
02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
the Conservation Commission that
 
02:16:35.950 --> 02:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
occurred in my house
 
02:16:38.669 --> 02:16:38.679 align:start position:0%
district in an effort to illustrate to
 
02:16:42.830 --> 02:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
you why this bill is needed and why you
 
02:16:44.309 --> 02:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
should consider it
 
02:16:46.950 --> 02:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
carefully so a few years ago there was
 
02:16:50.549 --> 02:16:50.559 align:start position:0%
an opening on a particular Town conser
 
02:16:53.110 --> 02:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission it was
 
02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
advertised the opening because a current
 
02:16:57.950 --> 02:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
member who had been appointed by the
 
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
select board was moving out of town a
 
02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
relatively well-known um resident wanted
 
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
to serve on the Conservation Commission
 
02:17:11.070 --> 02:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
they had a a degree science in in a
 
02:17:15.270 --> 02:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
scientific degree they um had background
 
02:17:18.669 --> 02:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
in conservation in ecology
 
02:17:21.629 --> 02:17:21.639 align:start position:0%
and so obviously when the opening came
 
02:17:23.950 --> 02:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
up the resident contacted the
 
02:17:27.709 --> 02:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission explor expressed
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
interest the person applied the person
 
02:17:32.549 --> 02:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
was interviewed by the Conservation
 
02:17:35.669 --> 02:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
Commission um it was a very productive
 
02:17:38.190 --> 02:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
um interaction and meeting discussion
 
02:17:40.709 --> 02:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
questions were answered and as a result
 
02:17:41.910 --> 02:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:17:45.150 --> 02:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
encounter the Conservation Commission
 
02:17:47.070 --> 02:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
made a recommendation to the select
 
02:17:49.790 --> 02:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
board highly recommen recommending this
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
individual there was no no issues no no
 
02:17:55.629 --> 02:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
questions and furthermore it's my
 
02:17:57.469 --> 02:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
understanding that this was the only
 
02:18:01.150 --> 02:18:01.160 align:start position:0%
applicant to fill this vacant
 
02:18:03.549 --> 02:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
position so without reasonable
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
explanation um this request for this
 
02:18:08.830 --> 02:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
member this resident to be appointed it
 
02:18:11.309 --> 02:18:11.319 align:start position:0%
was denied by the select board and
 
02:18:13.509 --> 02:18:13.519 align:start position:0%
clearly the decision was not due to a
 
02:18:15.750 --> 02:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
lack of the candidates
 
02:18:19.629 --> 02:18:19.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:22.549 --> 02:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
it was because the select board um did
 
02:18:25.549 --> 02:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
not care for this particular individual
 
02:18:29.389 --> 02:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
because um for an issue that was
 
02:18:32.910 --> 02:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
unrelated to the Conservation Commission
 
02:18:35.629 --> 02:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
the individual in fact was taking
 
02:18:38.990 --> 02:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
pictures of trees that were being cut
 
02:18:45.270 --> 02:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
down um on a um project within the town
 
02:18:48.030 --> 02:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
and was wondering and questioning well
 
02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
why are these trees being removed there
 
02:18:52.309 --> 02:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
was no discussion um the proof of
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
concept renderings showed the trees
 
02:18:58.230 --> 02:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
there the person was simply asking
 
02:19:02.190 --> 02:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
questions so um long story short this
 
02:19:05.549 --> 02:19:05.559 align:start position:0%
incident resulted in this resident not
 
02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
being appointed to the conservation um
 
02:19:11.469 --> 02:19:11.479 align:start position:0%
commission by the select board despite
 
02:19:13.549 --> 02:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
the Conservation Commission members
 
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
wanting this person as a result of this
 
02:19:20.070 --> 02:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
denial the conservation um Commission in
 
02:19:22.309 --> 02:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
this particular Town ended up having a
 
02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
vacancy for several
 
02:19:28.469 --> 02:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
months despite having a person that was
 
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
ready willing and able um to to fill
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
that position wor yet the con the
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission really needed
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
this this this help on their committee
 
02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
and they had to unnecessarily operate
 
02:19:46.990 --> 02:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
during a very busy time with four board
 
02:19:50.910 --> 02:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
members and and not five in some towns
 
02:19:53.070 --> 02:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
voters might want to have the
 
02:19:55.590 --> 02:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission be more
 
02:19:58.110 --> 02:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
accountable to them the voters when
 
02:20:00.030 --> 02:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
members are appointed by the select
 
02:20:03.070 --> 02:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
board there's indirect accountability at
 
02:20:05.389 --> 02:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
best house bill
 
02:20:08.550 --> 02:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
1302 provides important enabling
 
02:20:11.389 --> 02:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
legislation for this option to elect
 
02:20:14.190 --> 02:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission members by the
 
02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
voters a town may choose to adopt
 
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
this provision or they can simply stay
 
02:20:23.870 --> 02:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
with appointing members by the select
 
02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
board towns can and importantly too
 
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
towns can also resend this option or the
 
02:20:31.870 --> 02:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
decision and they can go back to
 
02:20:35.830 --> 02:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
appointing members if they so desire
 
02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
moreover recently in my town where
 
02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
Brookline War there was warrant articles
 
02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
to CH to change from appointed um to
 
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
elected planning board board members and
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
also um to change from appointed to
 
02:20:55.349 --> 02:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
elected zoning board members and in
 
02:20:58.190 --> 02:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
these past um with more than a two-third
 
02:21:02.349 --> 02:21:02.359 align:start position:0%
super majority vote and I I say that um
 
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
just to to emphasize that these boards
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
that the land use boards it we have
 
02:21:11.349 --> 02:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation on the stat on in
 
02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
statute to allow this to go from
 
02:21:16.150 --> 02:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
appointed to elected and this bill
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
simply just allow is um providing the
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the same procedure
 
02:21:24.790 --> 02:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation for the
 
02:21:28.349 --> 02:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission in some towns um
 
02:21:31.389 --> 02:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
yeah voters want to be able to directly
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
decide who serves on these important
 
02:21:38.349 --> 02:21:38.359 align:start position:0%
boards so um one more point is this year
 
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
in Brooklyn the our Conservation
 
02:21:42.990 --> 02:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
Commission is recommending through the
 
02:21:47.830 --> 02:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
select board a $4.3 million Bond for
 
02:21:50.349 --> 02:21:50.359 align:start position:0%
conservation land purchase and our
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
operating budget is $8 million that's
 
02:21:56.510 --> 02:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
pretty significant and pretty important
 
02:21:58.830 --> 02:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
um and um such a purchase has a
 
02:22:02.750 --> 02:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
significant tax impact so to be very
 
02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
clear the con the members of that
 
02:22:06.750 --> 02:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission they serve a
 
02:22:10.270 --> 02:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
very important role in local governance
 
02:22:12.830 --> 02:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
so finally to be clear conservation
 
02:22:14.309 --> 02:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
Commissions in New Hampshire are
 
02:22:17.389 --> 02:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
becoming increasingly influential in
 
02:22:20.750 --> 02:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
important conservation measures some of
 
02:22:25.429 --> 02:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
which involve significant long-term
 
02:22:28.910 --> 02:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
purchases therefore having the option to
 
02:22:31.349 --> 02:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
elect Conservation Commission members is
 
02:22:34.469 --> 02:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
a very reasonable measure which is why
 
02:22:37.910 --> 02:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is very important in closing I
 
02:22:40.870 --> 02:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to vote the committee
 
02:22:42.990 --> 02:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation of ought to pass on this
 
02:22:46.389 --> 02:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
bill in support of direct accountability
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
to the voters
 
02:22:50.990 --> 02:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
in municipalities that choose to adopt
 
02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
this enabling statute with that I will
 
02:22:57.349 --> 02:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
you representative Guthrie thank you and
 
02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I know that
 
02:23:09.070 --> 02:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
the uh uh elected select board uh
 
02:23:12.190 --> 02:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
sometime uh inadequate maybe because
 
02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:13.309 align:start position:0%
sometime uh inadequate maybe because
they're

02:23:13.309 --> 02:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:23:19.110 --> 02:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
elected uh and uh my point is that if if
 
02:23:22.830 --> 02:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
they act as you have described and the
 
02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor has described isn't that
 
02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
correction if there is a need for a
 
02:23:32.389 --> 02:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
correction made at the polls when the
 
02:23:34.870 --> 02:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
Selectmen themselves
 
02:23:36.790 --> 02:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
run thank you for the question
 
02:23:39.309 --> 02:23:39.319 align:start position:0%
representative I could you please I am
 
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
not following your question could you
 
02:23:42.830 --> 02:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
please restate the question sorry sorry
 
02:23:47.070 --> 02:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
about that uh don't the uh any
 
02:23:50.070 --> 02:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
correction because of the actions of the
 
02:23:53.309 --> 02:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
selectman in the appointing of the
 
02:23:56.950 --> 02:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
county of the commission uh isn't that
 
02:23:59.230 --> 02:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
corrected at the
 
02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
polls by uh the vote that's given to the
 
02:24:06.750 --> 02:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
Selectmen that are acting in that manner
 
02:24:08.349 --> 02:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative so I sure to be clear
 
02:24:13.870 --> 02:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
you're saying that if if the
 
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
Selectmen you
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
know don't or or for lack of better
 
02:24:22.590 --> 02:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
words mess up or or or
 
02:24:25.070 --> 02:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
don't don't appoint somebody to the
 
02:24:28.070 --> 02:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission or or whatever
 
02:24:32.429 --> 02:24:32.439 align:start position:0%
they they it can be I I guess corrected
 
02:24:35.190 --> 02:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
um at at the at The Ballot
 
02:24:38.670 --> 02:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
Box yeah but the PO the point that we're
 
02:24:40.110 --> 02:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
trying to make here with this
 
02:24:45.030 --> 02:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
legislation is that that's really that
 
02:24:49.429 --> 02:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
that's somewhat indirect and and and
 
02:24:52.269 --> 02:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
that's select boards make many many
 
02:24:54.990 --> 02:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
decisions and I don't really see with
 
02:24:57.230 --> 02:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
regards to the Conservation Commission
 
02:25:01.990 --> 02:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
who who they appoint voters to um take
 
02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
action based based on
 
02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
that I think what is important to
 
02:25:09.070 --> 02:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
understand as I explained in my
 
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
testimony it's not this one you
 
02:25:16.150 --> 02:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
know story or incident that that that
 
02:25:18.630 --> 02:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
happened in my District you
 
02:25:21.269 --> 02:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
know that's some evidence but I the
 
02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
bigger and the the the bigger emphasis
 
02:25:27.429 --> 02:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
in the more important point is that
 
02:25:29.750 --> 02:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions are they serve
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
a very important function and
 
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
therefore to provide a enabling
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
legislation so
 
02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
that voters if the town so chooses to
 
02:25:47.070 --> 02:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
have those Conservation Commission
 
02:25:49.790 --> 02:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
members elected this is just another
 
02:25:53.550 --> 02:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
tool in the tool box and then and
 
02:25:55.830 --> 02:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
then members of the Conservation
 
02:25:58.030 --> 02:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
Commission are directly accountable to
 
02:25:58.040 --> 02:25:59.309 align:start position:0%
Commission are directly accountable to
the

02:25:59.309 --> 02:25:59.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:26:01.990 --> 02:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
voters and I think it's just a better a
 
02:26:05.349 --> 02:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
better um process Mr chairman to follow
 
02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
up quickly if I could uh very quickly
 
02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
and you know the sponsors be is to
 
02:26:17.510 --> 02:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
be uh gets an adab boy for making it so
 
02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh we have a choice instead of being a
 
02:26:24.230 --> 02:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
directive but knowing that how important
 
02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
the con the Conservation Commission is
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
and how sometimes technical it is as the
 
02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor indicated he had the background
 
02:26:36.309 --> 02:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
and should have been appointed knowing
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
that how do we justify that anybody can
 
02:26:41.950 --> 02:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
run for the County Commission whoever
 
02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:44.349 align:start position:0%
run for the County Commission whoever
they

02:26:44.349 --> 02:26:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:48.389 --> 02:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
are thank you representative uh again at
 
02:26:50.030 --> 02:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
the end of your question you said
 
02:26:52.030 --> 02:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
running for County Commissioner I'm
 
02:26:54.750 --> 02:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm confused yeah I I'm sorry
 
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for picking me up on that but
 
02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
the fact is that anybody anybody can for
 
02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
can run for the Conservation Commission
 
02:27:05.190 --> 02:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
no matter what kind of background they
 
02:27:08.269 --> 02:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
have and there's no uh double check on
 
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
that where there is when the it's
 
02:27:13.269 --> 02:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
appointed by the SE selectman thank you
 
02:27:14.309 --> 02:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
02:27:16.309 --> 02:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
question my answer to that would be it
 
02:27:18.830 --> 02:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
it's no different than any other office
 
02:27:21.870 --> 02:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
every elected office is very important
 
02:27:24.309 --> 02:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
do you know you could say ask the same
 
02:27:25.790 --> 02:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
question with regards to the select
 
02:27:28.030 --> 02:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
board I mean anybody can run for select
 
02:27:29.710 --> 02:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
board do do they have business
 
02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
experience do they have a you know
 
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
running anything experienced they have
 
02:27:37.710 --> 02:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
Financial experience at So my answer to
 
02:27:40.510 --> 02:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
to to all of that would be when a person
 
02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
runs there's interaction with the voters
 
02:27:46.230 --> 02:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know they campaign there's websites
 
02:27:49.269 --> 02:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
there's forums there's debates all that
 
02:27:51.750 --> 02:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
can be uncovered and discovered during
 
02:27:55.230 --> 02:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
that process representative
 
02:27:57.870 --> 02:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:27:59.590 --> 02:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
02:28:04.670 --> 02:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
question um I'm new to local control so
 
02:28:07.950 --> 02:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
under line
 
02:28:14.269 --> 02:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
13 when the town has adopted the
 
02:28:17.230 --> 02:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
provisions to make this possible
 
02:28:20.590 --> 02:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
is it not the selectman that
 
02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
would recommend an article to
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
adopt thank you for the question
 
02:28:28.670 --> 02:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative so if this is enabling
 
02:28:31.469 --> 02:28:31.479 align:start position:0%
statute there's two ways that this could
 
02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
get on the the warrant the first would
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
be the the selectman could be asked or
 
02:28:40.429 --> 02:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better word petitioned by
 
02:28:44.269 --> 02:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
the voters in in the town to place this
 
02:28:47.870 --> 02:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
enabling statute on on the warrant and
 
02:28:52.070 --> 02:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
secondly the legislature in its
 
02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
um what's the word I'm looking for
 
02:28:57.990 --> 02:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
wisdom thank you in its wisdom has
 
02:29:03.030 --> 02:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
allowed um the citizens to put warrants
 
02:29:05.550 --> 02:29:05.560 align:start position:0%
on the ballot through a process called a
 
02:29:08.349 --> 02:29:08.359 align:start position:0%
petition to Warrant article I've been
 
02:29:09.429 --> 02:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
there thank
 
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
you major thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:29:15.550 --> 02:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um have
 
02:29:16.990 --> 02:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
you contacted the New Hampshire
 
02:29:19.630 --> 02:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
Association of conservation commissions
 
02:29:21.950 --> 02:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
and and if so did they have any input
 
02:29:23.950 --> 02:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative thank
 
02:29:27.309 --> 02:29:27.319 align:start position:0%
you for the question so um I am a i a
 
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this legislation and I
 
02:29:33.870 --> 02:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
have personally not contacted that
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
agency are the questions representative
 
02:29:39.710 --> 02:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you for taking the
 
02:29:41.670 --> 02:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
question you keep on talking about
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
accountability and um are
 
02:29:49.830 --> 02:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
you is it your belief that this this
 
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
legislation is um important because of
 
02:29:57.630 --> 02:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
the uh requirement in article 8 of The
 
02:29:59.070 --> 02:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution that requires the
 
02:30:01.830 --> 02:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
government be open and accessible and
 
02:30:05.790 --> 02:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
accountable to the people of the that
 
02:30:07.950 --> 02:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
they serve thank you representative
 
02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um in my mind
 
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
this enabling um legislation like I said
 
02:30:18.469 --> 02:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
is another tool another option and to me
 
02:30:21.230 --> 02:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
it's it and it allows the
 
02:30:24.990 --> 02:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
voters more direct I guess democracy if
 
02:30:28.150 --> 02:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
you would by being able to vote and
 
02:30:34.750 --> 02:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:37.630 --> 02:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
Commission representative Gilman thank
 
02:30:38.990 --> 02:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:40.510 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you
representative

02:30:40.510 --> 02:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:30:43.269 --> 02:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
um conservation commissions have their
 
02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
own chapter unlike the planning board
 
02:30:48.790 --> 02:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
zba Etc
 
02:30:52.630 --> 02:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
um and those other bodies
 
02:30:56.349 --> 02:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
are uh regulatory they can make their
 
02:31:00.070 --> 02:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
own subdivisions and uh and the zba has
 
02:31:02.830 --> 02:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
you know the zoning ordinance but the
 
02:31:02.840 --> 02:31:06.389 align:start position:0%
you know the zoning ordinance but the
Conservation

02:31:06.389 --> 02:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:10.230 --> 02:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
Commission is made to
 
02:31:15.990 --> 02:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
um oversee and uh maintain Etc but they
 
02:31:17.309 --> 02:31:17.319 align:start position:0%
can't make a
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
decision about to purchase or whatever
 
02:31:23.230 --> 02:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
piece of property without the governing
 
02:31:27.870 --> 02:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
body and so my question is um and maybe
 
02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
this applies to all the land use boards
 
02:31:34.870 --> 02:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
but uh would you expect to find uh
 
02:31:37.309 --> 02:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
regular amount of people who are willing
 
02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
to um run for an election and pay money
 
02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
for what is a volunteer job given New
 
02:31:47.269 --> 02:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's run by volunteers
 
02:31:48.150 --> 02:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:31:52.510 --> 02:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh it's unclear to me um
 
02:31:55.710 --> 02:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
what what your referencing with regards
 
02:32:00.630 --> 02:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
to paying money um in my district the Lo
 
02:32:06.110 --> 02:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
local races nobody um pays money to to
 
02:32:09.550 --> 02:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
per I I I assume that you're perhaps
 
02:32:12.670 --> 02:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
referencing like to run a campaign
 
02:32:16.349 --> 02:32:16.359 align:start position:0%
um that just doesn't happen and you know
 
02:32:21.910 --> 02:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
in my um District so I don't have um
 
02:32:24.230 --> 02:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
that's I can only answer it to that
 
02:32:28.269 --> 02:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
degree and so I think the question to me
 
02:32:30.830 --> 02:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
that you're asking is would there be a
 
02:32:30.840 --> 02:32:31.830 align:start position:0%
that you're asking is would there be a
problem

02:32:31.830 --> 02:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:32:35.750 --> 02:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
with having um people run and I would
 
02:32:37.830 --> 02:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
say no and again I would remind the
 
02:32:39.550 --> 02:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
committee that this is enabling
 
02:32:42.510 --> 02:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
legislation if a particular Town didn't
 
02:32:44.830 --> 02:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
want it didn't think it was good then
 
02:32:48.630 --> 02:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
there's no obligation to to adopt this
 
02:32:51.309 --> 02:32:51.319 align:start position:0%
the for example I all
 
02:32:53.630 --> 02:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
right you answered the question very
 
02:32:56.590 --> 02:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you further questions seeing
 
02:32:58.150 --> 02:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
none I have one representative I know
 
02:33:01.389 --> 02:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
you'll know the answer to this uh back
 
02:33:03.389 --> 02:33:03.399 align:start position:0%
as many others have mentioned line 15
 
02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
and 16 the select May remove the elected
 
02:33:10.590 --> 02:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
member for cause um it's been said that
 
02:33:13.230 --> 02:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
some of the other committees that are
 
02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
elected the Selectmen have that
 
02:33:18.590 --> 02:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
could you point me to the AR just for my
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
personal U edification point me to the
 
02:33:26.670 --> 02:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
RSA where that happens and the only
 
02:33:29.870 --> 02:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
reason I ask that is I find
 
02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:32.230 align:start position:0%
reason I ask that is I find
it

02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:33:35.630 --> 02:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
almost antithetical to an election to be
 
02:33:38.070 --> 02:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
to have one body be able to remove
 
02:33:40.510 --> 02:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
another body and if that exists already
 
02:33:42.469 --> 02:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
that might require some future
 
02:33:44.510 --> 02:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you for the question
 
02:33:48.190 --> 02:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:52.110 --> 02:33:52.120 align:start position:0%
so you're asking so to be clear I didn't
 
02:33:55.550 --> 02:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
write this bill OS drafted the bill
 
02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
additionally I'm not the prime sponsor
 
02:34:00.550 --> 02:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
however I do understand that this the
 
02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
language for this this bill is mirrors
 
02:34:07.230 --> 02:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
the language the enabling statute for
 
02:34:10.550 --> 02:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
planning boards and the zba so I would
 
02:34:13.269 --> 02:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
refer you to to those statutes and
 
02:34:15.070 --> 02:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't have those
 
02:34:17.670 --> 02:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
memorized thank you representative
 
02:34:19.830 --> 02:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:34:22.349 --> 02:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so to follow up
 
02:34:26.469 --> 02:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
if I may on uh the chair's
 
02:34:26.479 --> 02:34:28.990 align:start position:0%
if I may on uh the chair's
question

02:34:28.990 --> 02:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:34:32.910 --> 02:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
so an elected official put into office
 
02:34:35.670 --> 02:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
under the terms of this enabling
 
02:34:38.309 --> 02:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
legislation is answerable to the people
 
02:34:40.670 --> 02:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
who elected him or her by virtue of the
 
02:34:43.150 --> 02:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
fact that they were elected yet once
 
02:34:45.750 --> 02:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
that elected official is in office they
 
02:34:48.750 --> 02:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
could be be removed by the same nasty
 
02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
select board that didn't want them to be
 
02:34:53.030 --> 02:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
there in the first place then what would
 
02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
be the point of electing them at all
 
02:34:56.510 --> 02:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
02:34:59.510 --> 02:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative again I would refer you
 
02:35:04.990 --> 02:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
to the fact that this bill mirrors the
 
02:35:08.389 --> 02:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
language for this bill was taken
 
02:35:11.349 --> 02:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
directly from the other
 
02:35:13.950 --> 02:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
statutes with regards to the other local
 
02:35:16.190 --> 02:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
land use board so I think if you're
 
02:35:18.269 --> 02:35:18.279 align:start position:0%
going to ask the question then that's a
 
02:35:22.230 --> 02:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
question that should apply to all three
 
02:35:22.240 --> 02:35:24.110 align:start position:0%
question that should apply to all three
um

02:35:24.110 --> 02:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:26.110 --> 02:35:26.120 align:start position:0%
boards follow
 
02:35:28.910 --> 02:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
up then I'll go back to my original
 
02:35:30.990 --> 02:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
question to representative sellers which
 
02:35:33.030 --> 02:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
is why does this only apply to the
 
02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:37.469 align:start position:0%
is why does this only apply to the
Conservation

02:35:37.469 --> 02:35:37.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:39.710 --> 02:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
Commission thank you for the question I
 
02:35:43.070 --> 02:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
I don't understand um the
 
02:35:45.990 --> 02:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
question why does this bill only mention
 
02:35:48.230 --> 02:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
mention the Conservation Commission if
 
02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
it follows that the other boards are
 
02:35:54.870 --> 02:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
under the same rule I apologize I I I'm
 
02:35:56.670 --> 02:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
not follow following the line of
 
02:35:59.670 --> 02:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
question you're asking why is this bill
 
02:36:01.469 --> 02:36:01.479 align:start position:0%
only pertain to the Conservation
 
02:36:04.269 --> 02:36:04.279 align:start position:0%
Commission in in what context are you
 
02:36:08.630 --> 02:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
asking that question I it B basically I
 
02:36:10.349 --> 02:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
think the answer to the question would
 
02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
be it pertains to this because it
 
02:36:16.830 --> 02:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
pertains to this it's the conserv
 
02:36:18.790 --> 02:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
composition of the Conservation
 
02:36:21.510 --> 02:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
Commission it it
 
02:36:25.469 --> 02:36:25.479 align:start position:0%
there the sponsors have not taken upon
 
02:36:27.190 --> 02:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
themselves to go into other sections
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
they're specifically focusing on
 
02:36:31.429 --> 02:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission whether that's
 
02:36:33.790 --> 02:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
right or wrong I guess I that would be
 
02:36:36.830 --> 02:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
the answer represent FR yes thank you Mr
 
02:36:38.750 --> 02:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:36:44.429 --> 02:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
question um is it true that
 
02:36:49.110 --> 02:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
the ZB ba and planning boards currently
 
02:36:52.389 --> 02:36:52.399 align:start position:0%
can be either appointed or
 
02:36:54.830 --> 02:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
elected they thank you for the question
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative I believe that is true
 
02:37:00.429 --> 02:37:00.439 align:start position:0%
because we there's enabling legislation
 
02:37:03.550 --> 02:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
I mean statute so they can be appointed
 
02:37:06.030 --> 02:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
or they could be elected yeah followup
 
02:37:09.110 --> 02:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair go ahead uh do you happen to
 
02:37:12.870 --> 02:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
know any historical background as to why
 
02:37:17.510 --> 02:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
the Conservation Commission is appointed
 
02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:18.710 align:start position:0%
the Conservation Commission is appointed
rather

02:37:18.710 --> 02:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
rather
 
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
than elected up to up to the point of
 
02:37:23.670 --> 02:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
your bill thank you for the question
 
02:37:27.309 --> 02:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:29.710 --> 02:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
not represent
 
02:37:34.230 --> 02:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so to go a bit more into
 
02:37:37.510 --> 02:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
the part about the select board removing
 
02:37:40.349 --> 02:37:40.359 align:start position:0%
them uh what I'm thinking of is the
 
02:37:43.710 --> 02:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
parallels between that and
 
02:37:46.710 --> 02:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
impeachment um where other elected
 
02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
bodies can remove someone from another
 
02:37:52.710 --> 02:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
Branch but um with cases of impeachment
 
02:37:57.190 --> 02:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's usually a 2third super majority so
 
02:37:59.269 --> 02:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
what would you think would would you be
 
02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
open to maybe say um remov by a with a
 
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
super majority vote or something for the
 
02:38:10.590 --> 02:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
um removal
 
02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
provision thank you for the question
 
02:38:17.670 --> 02:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative um it appears to me that
 
02:38:17.680 --> 02:38:18.590 align:start position:0%
representative um it appears to me that
this

02:38:18.590 --> 02:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:38:21.150 --> 02:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
this this sentence here is causing
 
02:38:24.349 --> 02:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
confusion so I I am open
 
02:38:27.910 --> 02:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
to as a co-sponsor I would be open to an
 
02:38:29.870 --> 02:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that would rectify the
 
02:38:32.030 --> 02:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
confusion I would also note that it does
 
02:38:34.030 --> 02:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
say after a public
 
02:38:37.230 --> 02:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
hearing representative Elward thank you
 
02:38:40.590 --> 02:38:40.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um
 
02:38:44.550 --> 02:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
representative under 673 colon 13
 
02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
removal of
 
02:38:51.309 --> 02:38:51.319 align:start position:0%
members it allows for uh an elected
 
02:38:54.910 --> 02:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
member to be removed by the board of
 
02:38:57.269 --> 02:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
Selectmen after a public
 
02:39:00.710 --> 02:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
hearing for causes
 
02:39:04.550 --> 02:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
enumerated in uh Roman 1 which
 
02:39:08.590 --> 02:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
are inefficiency neglect of Duty or
 
02:39:12.349 --> 02:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
malfeasance in office do you believe
 
02:39:12.359 --> 02:39:13.750 align:start position:0%
malfeasance in office do you believe
that

02:39:13.750 --> 02:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:39:16.150 --> 02:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
this was what
 
02:39:19.150 --> 02:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
um line 15 and
 
02:39:24.269 --> 02:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
16 was referencing or or used as a model
 
02:39:25.190 --> 02:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:39:28.830 --> 02:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
representative um again I didn't draft
 
02:39:32.190 --> 02:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
this bill OLS did and I'm not the prime
 
02:39:35.510 --> 02:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor but it is my understanding that
 
02:39:38.910 --> 02:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
it was the intent was to model so that
 
02:39:39.950 --> 02:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:39:44.349 --> 02:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
consistency after the other um enabling
 
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
statute so if you're telling me that
 
02:39:50.790 --> 02:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
negligence malfeasance and inefficiency
 
02:39:55.750 --> 02:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
are listed out specifically then I I I
 
02:39:58.030 --> 02:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
would prefer that that would be listed
 
02:39:59.870 --> 02:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
out specifically and not replaced by
 
02:40:04.110 --> 02:40:04.120 align:start position:0%
four cause because clearly those three
 
02:40:06.510 --> 02:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
reasons are very specific and I would
 
02:40:12.190 --> 02:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
prefer that for the most part or when um
 
02:40:14.710 --> 02:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
when it makes sense to have things
 
02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:16.630 align:start position:0%
when it makes sense to have things
consistent

02:40:16.630 --> 02:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:17.990 align:start position:0%
consistent
thank

02:40:17.990 --> 02:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:40:20.349 --> 02:40:20.359 align:start position:0%

um do you think the language that was
 
02:40:32.469 --> 02:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
written by OS um as far as for cause was
 
02:40:36.070 --> 02:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
a specific legal
 
02:40:38.070 --> 02:40:38.080 align:start position:0%

can't I can't comment as to the thought
 
02:40:48.670 --> 02:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
process um I'm not an attorney so we
 
02:40:50.269 --> 02:40:50.279 align:start position:0%
somebody would have to follow up with
 
02:40:54.389 --> 02:40:54.399 align:start position:0%
OSS and ask that specific pointed
 
02:40:56.510 --> 02:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
question representative Holland you had
 
02:40:59.510 --> 02:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
your hand up before uh actually my
 
02:41:01.469 --> 02:41:01.479 align:start position:0%
question was kind of answered was like
 
02:41:04.389 --> 02:41:04.399 align:start position:0%
it was that's fine very good further
 
02:41:06.590 --> 02:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:41:08.030 --> 02:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony I have one
 
02:41:14.429 --> 02:41:14.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:14.439 --> 02:41:19.830 align:start position:0%
 
RoR

02:41:19.830 --> 02:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:21.309 --> 02:41:21.319 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee for
 
02:41:24.030 --> 02:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to comment on House Bill
 
02:41:27.030 --> 02:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
1302 my name is Barbara RoR I'm the
 
02:41:28.750 --> 02:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
02:41:31.670 --> 02:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
Association of conservation commissions
 
02:41:33.510 --> 02:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
um for those of you who don't know who
 
02:41:36.389 --> 02:41:36.399 align:start position:0%
nhacc is we are a nonprofit organization
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
we serve 217 Municipal conservation
 
02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
commissions here in New Hampshire we
 
02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
support commissions so that they can be
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
successful and protecting their local
 
02:41:49.269 --> 02:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
natural resources we give them the tools
 
02:41:50.830 --> 02:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
they need so that they can go back to
 
02:41:52.670 --> 02:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
their communities and do all this good
 
02:41:56.389 --> 02:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
work and we are opposed to House Bill
 
02:41:59.790 --> 02:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
1302 because we believe that overall it
 
02:42:02.990 --> 02:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
will um reduce the number of willing
 
02:42:05.269 --> 02:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
volunteers to serve in these committees
 
02:42:06.790 --> 02:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
and we we understand that it's an
 
02:42:09.910 --> 02:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
optional process but it there's some
 
02:42:12.750 --> 02:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
complications in this that maybe I'll
 
02:42:14.710 --> 02:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
I'll kind of go through as we as I go
 
02:42:16.269 --> 02:42:16.279 align:start position:0%
further but first I'd like to just
 
02:42:18.630 --> 02:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
highlight conservation commissions and
 
02:42:20.469 --> 02:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
they play an important role in their
 
02:42:22.630 --> 02:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
local communities they're charged with
 
02:42:24.590 --> 02:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
the protection of natural resources and
 
02:42:27.230 --> 02:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
Water Resources in their communities and
 
02:42:29.389 --> 02:42:29.399 align:start position:0%
most governing bodies in New Hampshire
 
02:42:32.230 --> 02:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
take this responsibility very serious
 
02:42:34.990 --> 02:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
and they follow the intent of
 
02:42:38.030 --> 02:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
36a conservation commissions are taking
 
02:42:40.510 --> 02:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
the lead on land conservation projects
 
02:42:42.190 --> 02:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
coordinating everything from purchase
 
02:42:43.550 --> 02:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
and sale to
 
02:42:45.870 --> 02:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
fundraising and thanks to conservation
 
02:42:48.030 --> 02:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
commissions cities and towns are now
 
02:42:50.190 --> 02:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
using sophisticated technology to
 
02:42:52.429 --> 02:42:52.439 align:start position:0%
identify their critical natural
 
02:42:54.670 --> 02:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
resources for protection in their Master
 
02:42:57.990 --> 02:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
plans and conservation plans volunteers
 
02:43:01.309 --> 02:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
are on the ground maintaining Trails
 
02:43:04.269 --> 02:43:04.279 align:start position:0%
managing invasive species and showcasing
 
02:43:07.510 --> 02:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
best management practices um on land
 
02:43:09.710 --> 02:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
conservation and town forests so that
 
02:43:13.670 --> 02:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
their neighbors can um learn by
 
02:43:15.950 --> 02:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
example um New Hampshire conservation
 
02:43:17.230 --> 02:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
commissions are active in their
 
02:43:19.469 --> 02:43:19.479 align:start position:0%
communities Ed with uh educational
 
02:43:21.830 --> 02:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
programs and Hikes to help citizens
 
02:43:23.790 --> 02:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
better understand the benefits of
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
protecting their natural environment so
 
02:43:28.510 --> 02:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
they do provide a per important public
 
02:43:30.510 --> 02:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
service to their communities New
 
02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:32.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would not have the same level
 
02:43:35.630 --> 02:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
of Clean Water fresh air and protected
 
02:43:38.349 --> 02:43:38.359 align:start position:0%
natural habitat um without Municipal
 
02:43:40.710 --> 02:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
conservation Comm commissions who care
 
02:43:42.469 --> 02:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
so deeply for their
 
02:43:42.479 --> 02:43:44.269 align:start position:0%
so deeply for their
communities

02:43:44.269 --> 02:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:43:44.279 --> 02:43:45.910 align:start position:0%
communities
um

02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:48.070 --> 02:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
and Conservation Commission members
 
02:43:50.429 --> 02:43:50.439 align:start position:0%
simply want to do their part for their
 
02:43:52.710 --> 02:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
environment and their Community um and
 
02:43:54.790 --> 02:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
this is often a welcome service in most
 
02:43:57.030 --> 02:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
most towns and so one of our greatest
 
02:43:58.670 --> 02:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
concerns with this bill is that it would
 
02:44:00.429 --> 02:44:00.439 align:start position:0%
lead to a lower number of local
 
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission
 
02:44:04.950 --> 02:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
volunteers um and I again we understand
 
02:44:08.070 --> 02:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
that it's optional but it could kind of
 
02:44:11.349 --> 02:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
snowball out of control if if towns you
 
02:44:14.790 --> 02:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
know um if you know if it does become
 
02:44:16.790 --> 02:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
the the option for
 
02:44:20.510 --> 02:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
towns so I know that the uh volunteers
 
02:44:22.750 --> 02:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
that I've talked with are not interested
 
02:44:25.309 --> 02:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
in running for a camp running a campaign
 
02:44:29.150 --> 02:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
for election um and they in many towns
 
02:44:31.790 --> 02:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
it does cost a lot of money and time to
 
02:44:33.750 --> 02:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
become elected and so there is that
 
02:44:35.910 --> 02:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
concern there that we would be losing
 
02:44:37.830 --> 02:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
some good people who just would not want
 
02:44:40.950 --> 02:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
to go through that process um and it and
 
02:44:43.110 --> 02:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
it seems like an additional layer for
 
02:44:44.150 --> 02:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
for a
 
02:44:46.790 --> 02:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
volunteer um we want citizens appointed
 
02:44:48.309 --> 02:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
to conservation commissions who are
 
02:44:50.309 --> 02:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
willing to do the work and not simply
 
02:44:52.070 --> 02:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
because they're popular in town or
 
02:44:54.030 --> 02:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
because their name is easily
 
02:44:56.510 --> 02:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
recognized and another piece that's
 
02:44:57.910 --> 02:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
important to consider is that
 
02:44:59.830 --> 02:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
relationship with their select board and
 
02:45:01.830 --> 02:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
I and I know that can be you know may
 
02:45:04.750 --> 02:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
not always be smooth and and run easily
 
02:45:07.630 --> 02:45:07.640 align:start position:0%
but um because the con the select board
 
02:45:10.389 --> 02:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
is responsible for in appointing the
 
02:45:12.349 --> 02:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission members they
 
02:45:14.670 --> 02:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
typically have a better understanding of
 
02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:15.910 align:start position:0%
typically have a better understanding of
those

02:45:15.910 --> 02:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:45:17.950 --> 02:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
those members they they know what their
 
02:45:20.750 --> 02:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
um interests are and they have a better
 
02:45:22.830 --> 02:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
kind of working relationship with them
 
02:45:25.230 --> 02:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
because they've they have chosen them to
 
02:45:28.150 --> 02:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
be on those commissions and and because
 
02:45:30.110 --> 02:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
I I think another important thing to
 
02:45:32.070 --> 02:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
consider here is that the Conservation
 
02:45:35.190 --> 02:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
Commission is advisory um and that was
 
02:45:38.110 --> 02:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
brought up before so in order for
 
02:45:40.190 --> 02:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
commissions to be successful they need
 
02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
to work closely with their planning
 
02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
board and their select board so we do
 
02:45:46.950 --> 02:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
want volun who can work with other
 
02:45:50.349 --> 02:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
people and who can um you know work with
 
02:45:51.990 --> 02:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
their select board and they they need to
 
02:45:53.830 --> 02:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
get along every year at our our
 
02:45:56.750 --> 02:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
conference we have a workshop on working
 
02:45:58.590 --> 02:45:58.600 align:start position:0%
with other boards because we believe
 
02:46:00.429 --> 02:46:00.439 align:start position:0%
that's that's how we you know New
 
02:46:02.590 --> 02:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire runs we work together we get
 
02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
things done so I don't know if that that
 
02:46:09.030 --> 02:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
would work so well if someone's just
 
02:46:11.750 --> 02:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
elected um and I also want to clarify
 
02:46:13.550 --> 02:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
that conservation commissions are not
 
02:46:16.830 --> 02:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
land use boards because they're advisory
 
02:46:20.830 --> 02:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
they do not um approve or deny permits
 
02:46:22.830 --> 02:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
there's no regulatory role that they
 
02:46:24.630 --> 02:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
have like a land use board planning
 
02:46:27.750 --> 02:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
board or zba so they don't really follow
 
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
the same structure as those other land
 
02:46:32.670 --> 02:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
use boards so just to clarify they're
 
02:46:34.429 --> 02:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
not a land use
 
02:46:38.750 --> 02:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
board um and and I also want to let you
 
02:46:41.269 --> 02:46:41.279 align:start position:0%
know that many towns have instituted a a
 
02:46:43.510 --> 02:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
very thorough interview process for
 
02:46:46.269 --> 02:46:46.279 align:start position:0%
appointments um they often require
 
02:46:47.670 --> 02:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
resumés or
 
02:46:50.309 --> 02:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
applications um many commission members
 
02:46:52.990 --> 02:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
are initially appointed as alternates so
 
02:46:55.469 --> 02:46:55.479 align:start position:0%
they gain experience before they become
 
02:46:58.870 --> 02:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
um voting members and um most
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities do rely on
 
02:47:02.550 --> 02:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations from conservation
 
02:47:05.269 --> 02:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
commissions for those new members it is
 
02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
certainly an unfortunate story and that
 
02:47:11.110 --> 02:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
may happen from time to time that the
 
02:47:12.710 --> 02:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
select board doesn't take a
 
02:47:14.309 --> 02:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation from a Conservation
 
02:47:17.269 --> 02:47:17.279 align:start position:0%
Commission but I from what I've seen
 
02:47:21.230 --> 02:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's rare and typically not the
 
02:47:24.550 --> 02:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
case and if it if it is the case you
 
02:47:25.950 --> 02:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
know we need to work on it we need to
 
02:47:29.110 --> 02:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
figure that out so I I ask that you
 
02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
don't threaten this thoughtful local
 
02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
process that's currently in place
 
02:47:35.269 --> 02:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
there's really no guarantee or evidence
 
02:47:37.190 --> 02:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
that elections would result in a more
 
02:47:39.950 --> 02:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
capable or committed group of local
 
02:47:39.960 --> 02:47:41.830 align:start position:0%

the election of Conservation Commission
 
02:47:50.070 --> 02:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
members um and this is not a practice in
 
02:47:52.910 --> 02:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
other states as well um and it's mainly
 
02:47:56.150 --> 02:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
because they're advisory um New

02:48:21.269 --> 02:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
questions you may
 
02:48:23.190 --> 02:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
have thank you very much for your
 
02:48:25.710 --> 02:48:25.720 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Elward thank
 
02:48:27.510 --> 02:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
02:48:30.910 --> 02:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
testimony today um it's my understanding
 
02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:32.070 align:start position:0%
testimony today um it's my understanding
there's

02:48:32.070 --> 02:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:34.150 align:start position:0%
there's
204

02:48:34.150 --> 02:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
204
 
02:48:37.150 --> 02:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state how many of
 
02:48:39.550 --> 02:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
those um municipalities have
 
02:48:41.710 --> 02:48:41.720 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions thank you for
 
02:48:45.269 --> 02:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
the question um I believe there's 23 4
 
02:48:48.830 --> 02:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
towns in New Hampshire um and 217 of
 
02:48:51.150 --> 02:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
those towns have conservation
 
02:48:54.870 --> 02:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
commissions and about 195 of those Town
 
02:48:57.630 --> 02:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
those commissions are members of the New
 
02:48:59.429 --> 02:48:59.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of conservation
 
02:49:02.309 --> 02:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
commissions follow up go
 
02:49:06.030 --> 02:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chairman do you think
 
02:49:09.830 --> 02:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
um the difference between 234 and
 
02:49:14.790 --> 02:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
27 might have something to do with types
 
02:49:18.110 --> 02:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
the complaints we've heard today that
 
02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:20.070 align:start position:0%
the complaints we've heard today that
perhaps

02:49:20.070 --> 02:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
02:49:23.309 --> 02:49:23.319 align:start position:0%
um there's a barrier somehow that this
 
02:49:25.590 --> 02:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to
 
02:49:28.309 --> 02:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
fix I I mean it does sound like there
 
02:49:31.910 --> 02:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
have been issues for certain towns and I
 
02:49:33.870 --> 02:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
you know I in some cases I'm not
 
02:49:36.990 --> 02:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
surprised I mean it's a tough uh
 
02:49:39.389 --> 02:49:39.399 align:start position:0%
position to be on a select board and to
 
02:49:42.590 --> 02:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
appoint members and um you know I think
 
02:49:46.030 --> 02:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't always work so we need to be
 
02:49:48.389 --> 02:49:48.399 align:start position:0%
aware of that and and try our best to to
 
02:49:51.229 --> 02:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
solve it but we believe
 
02:49:54.389 --> 02:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
actually you know the current process
 
02:49:54.399 --> 02:49:56.150 align:start position:0%
actually you know the current process
works

02:49:56.150 --> 02:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
works
 
02:49:59.550 --> 02:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
and the the proposed um proposing
 
02:50:01.830 --> 02:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
elections I think is kind of would have
 
02:50:04.150 --> 02:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
more unintended consequences than we'd
 
02:50:06.710 --> 02:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
be prepared to to deal with
 
02:50:08.750 --> 02:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative majori thank you Mr
 
02:50:09.950 --> 02:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking a
 
02:50:11.590 --> 02:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
question which is just clarification I
 
02:50:13.030 --> 02:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
was writing something else down did you
 
02:50:15.309 --> 02:50:15.319 align:start position:0%
say that did did I hear correctly that
 
02:50:17.830 --> 02:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
no other no other surrounding States
 
02:50:20.309 --> 02:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
elect that's correct no other um
 
02:50:21.550 --> 02:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
surrounding States elect their
 
02:50:24.670 --> 02:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission members thank
 
02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:26.830 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission members thank
you

02:50:26.830 --> 02:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:50:29.309 --> 02:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
02:50:31.389 --> 02:50:31.399 align:start position:0%
thanks for your your testimony I happen
 
02:50:34.190 --> 02:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
to be a leon to my Conservation
 
02:50:37.070 --> 02:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
Commission and would you say it's fair
 
02:50:40.309 --> 02:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
it's fair to say that not only do the
 
02:50:43.990 --> 02:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
selectman appoint the Conservation
 
02:50:46.070 --> 02:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
Commission me members but they they have
 
02:50:49.630 --> 02:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
a close relationship as they go forward
 
02:50:53.229 --> 02:50:53.239 align:start position:0%
doing their job yes I would say ideally
 
02:50:55.269 --> 02:50:55.279 align:start position:0%
they do have a close uh working
 
02:50:56.950 --> 02:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
relationship with their commission
 
02:50:59.550 --> 02:50:59.560 align:start position:0%
members and again it's important because
 
02:51:01.469 --> 02:51:01.479 align:start position:0%
commissions are advisory so if they want
 
02:51:03.990 --> 02:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
to achieve goals they really need the
 
02:51:06.309 --> 02:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
support of Select board and planning
 
02:51:09.670 --> 02:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
board to to um you know move certain
 
02:51:12.190 --> 02:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
projects forward thank you thank you Mr
 
02:51:15.550 --> 02:51:15.560 align:start position:0%
chairman representative Gallagher
 
02:51:19.990 --> 02:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh so I heard uh two separate claims in
 
02:51:23.670 --> 02:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
there one um that it will
 
02:51:27.710 --> 02:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
make um make it harder to find
 
02:51:32.349 --> 02:51:32.359 align:start position:0%
volunteers for this position and two
 
02:51:32.359 --> 02:51:34.550 align:start position:0%
volunteers for this position and two
that

02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:51:39.550 --> 02:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
um people um R running in elections
 
02:51:43.190 --> 02:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
would have to raise more money which
 
02:51:45.510 --> 02:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
they might want to do but don't you kind
 
02:51:48.510 --> 02:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
of think those two claims are intention
 
02:51:50.990 --> 02:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
with one another like if you're the only
 
02:51:53.790 --> 02:51:53.800 align:start position:0%
one running would you really have to
 
02:51:56.110 --> 02:51:56.120 align:start position:0%
raise money then like I was on a post in
 
02:51:57.550 --> 02:51:57.560 align:start position:0%
my last election and didn't raise
 
02:52:00.349 --> 02:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:03.309 --> 02:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
it I I mean that's it's certainly
 
02:52:06.389 --> 02:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
possible that you would not need to
 
02:52:08.750 --> 02:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
spend money to run an election you know
 
02:52:11.030 --> 02:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
to run for Conservation Commission
 
02:52:13.710 --> 02:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
member but I do know in many communities
 
02:52:16.150 --> 02:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
it can be expensive and that was my only
 
02:52:18.150 --> 02:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
point that it can be expensive can be
 
02:52:21.670 --> 02:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
time consum time consuming and I believe
 
02:52:25.469 --> 02:52:25.479 align:start position:0%
it would be um detrimental to a certain
 
02:52:27.229 --> 02:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
number of volunteers that wouldn't want
 
02:52:28.750 --> 02:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
to go through that
 
02:52:31.030 --> 02:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
process further
 
02:52:33.309 --> 02:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have two quick
 
02:52:36.070 --> 02:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
ones um you mentioned no other states
 
02:52:38.510 --> 02:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
surrounding states have uh elected
 
02:52:39.990 --> 02:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions are there any
 
02:52:42.830 --> 02:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
states that do that not that I'm aware
 
02:52:45.830 --> 02:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
of so um okay it's mostly a New England
 
02:52:49.269 --> 02:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
thing um other states have more of what
 
02:52:52.510 --> 02:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
you'd consider Conservation District or
 
02:52:52.520 --> 02:52:55.910 align:start position:0%
you'd consider Conservation District or
environmental

02:52:55.910 --> 02:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:58.469 --> 02:52:58.479 align:start position:0%
commissions okay thank you um the second
 
02:53:01.269 --> 02:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
one you mentioned a couple of times that
 
02:53:04.070 --> 02:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
this is enabling but you could see this
 
02:53:06.309 --> 02:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
quote snowballing out of control could
 
02:53:08.670 --> 02:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
you give me a very simplified example of
 
02:53:10.990 --> 02:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
how it would snowball out of control
 
02:53:14.830 --> 02:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
sure um I I think you know while it
 
02:53:19.110 --> 02:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
could often get good um members in there
 
02:53:22.070 --> 02:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
um talented um
 
02:53:24.590 --> 02:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
thoughtful um Conservation Commission
 
02:53:27.110 --> 02:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
members I believe it could also uh run
 
02:53:28.870 --> 02:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
in the opposite direction where you
 
02:53:32.870 --> 02:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
could um elect members who aren't really
 
02:53:34.510 --> 02:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
interested in protecting natural
 
02:53:38.790 --> 02:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
resources who may um you know have an
 
02:53:41.510 --> 02:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
opposing view of what the commission
 
02:53:44.630 --> 02:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
should be working on um and and and I
 
02:53:46.830 --> 02:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
think my other main concern though
 
02:53:49.229 --> 02:53:49.239 align:start position:0%
really when I say snowball is that you
 
02:53:51.910 --> 02:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
know we'd have you know a select board
 
02:53:54.150 --> 02:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
here and a commission here and they
 
02:53:56.429 --> 02:53:56.439 align:start position:0%
would not be working together and then
 
02:53:59.710 --> 02:53:59.720 align:start position:0%
you would really be very ineffective so
 
02:54:02.750 --> 02:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
that that's my main concern when I say
 
02:54:04.550 --> 02:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
snowballs you're going to have these two
 
02:54:06.389 --> 02:54:06.399 align:start position:0%
different boards and they're not going
 
02:54:08.550 --> 02:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
to work together and basically they
 
02:54:10.790 --> 02:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
won't be
 
02:54:15.389 --> 02:54:15.399 align:start position:0%
effective thank you further questions
 
02:54:18.070 --> 02:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:54:20.670 --> 02:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
uh we have thank you very much blue
 
02:54:23.349 --> 02:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
sheet we have one individual signed in
 
02:54:25.630 --> 02:54:25.640 align:start position:0%
against and that was it on the blue
 
02:54:28.110 --> 02:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
sheet seeing no more pink cards close
 
02:54:31.429 --> 02:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
the hearing on HB 1302 we are scheduled
 
02:54:34.950 --> 02:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
to be back at 1:30 for what will be a
 
02:54:37.870 --> 02:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
very interesting
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:43.279 --> 02:55:00.349 align:start position:0%
 
then

02:55:00.349 --> 02:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:04.389 --> 02:55:04.399 align:start position:0%

02:55:13.200 --> 03:52:38.030 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:38.040 --> 03:53:37.950 align:start position:0%

resort and I see the prime sponsor is
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:37.159 --> 04:02:38.670 align:start position:0%
 
floor

04:02:38.670 --> 04:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
floor
 
04:02:40.950 --> 04:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good afternoon
 
04:02:42.630 --> 04:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
04:02:45.590 --> 04:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
committee my name is uh representative
 
04:02:49.910 --> 04:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
Barbara compa belnap 7 for the
 
04:02:52.790 --> 04:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
record this bill
 
04:02:56.510 --> 04:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
covers addresses three different
 
04:02:59.229 --> 04:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
situations um and I'll just do a quick
 
04:03:00.990 --> 04:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
overview and then I'll expound on each
 
04:03:05.469 --> 04:03:05.479 align:start position:0%
of them the first one is to
 
04:03:08.870 --> 04:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of Revenue that the
 
04:03:11.790 --> 04:03:11.800 align:start position:0%
county receives from Gunstock from
 
04:03:14.269 --> 04:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
1.75% to
 
04:03:18.189 --> 04:03:18.199 align:start position:0%
3% the second section is regarding
 
04:03:20.389 --> 04:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
meetings and the third section is
 
04:03:22.510 --> 04:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
requiring forensic
 
04:03:25.750 --> 04:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
audit I'll speak to the first
 
04:03:30.269 --> 04:03:30.279 align:start position:0%
part when this we went to this form of
 
04:03:33.070 --> 04:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
contribution to from Gunstock to the
 
04:03:35.870 --> 04:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
county the original bill was going to
 
04:03:39.670 --> 04:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
ask for 5%
 
04:03:43.790 --> 04:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
um and it was decided upon at that time
 
04:03:47.229 --> 04:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:53.189 --> 04:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
1.75% uh to get a 100% Buy in but at the
 
04:03:55.149 --> 04:03:55.159 align:start position:0%
time when I spoke to the prime sponsor
 
04:03:59.590 --> 04:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
of this bill several of the sponsors um
 
04:04:01.950 --> 04:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
that have now sent in letters to this
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:09.750 --> 04:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
that we're asking for this
 
04:04:09.760 --> 04:04:11.670 align:start position:0%
that we're asking for this
increase

04:04:11.670 --> 04:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:04:11.680 --> 04:04:13.510 align:start position:0%
increase
because

04:04:13.510 --> 04:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:04:18.149 --> 04:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
Gunstock is an asset of the county it is
 
04:04:19.550 --> 04:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
the county
 
04:04:23.790 --> 04:04:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:26.710 --> 04:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
stock and it is the county
 
04:04:30.229 --> 04:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that if gun stock defaults on
 
04:04:32.910 --> 04:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
anything it is them that has to pick up
 
04:04:32.920 --> 04:04:34.110 align:start position:0%
anything it is them that has to pick up
the

04:04:34.110 --> 04:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
tab and that has happened in the
 
04:04:36.960 --> 04:04:39.349 align:start position:0%
tab and that has happened in the
past

04:04:39.349 --> 04:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
past
 
04:04:43.870 --> 04:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
dollars so I am coming here for a modest
 
04:04:50.229 --> 04:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
increase of
 
04:04:53.149 --> 04:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
1.25% of gross
 
04:04:53.159 --> 04:04:55.229 align:start position:0%
1.25% of gross
income

04:04:55.229 --> 04:04:55.239 align:start position:0%
income
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:04.349 --> 04:05:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:07.950 --> 04:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
section being subject to 91a public
 
04:05:10.990 --> 04:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
meetings shall be recorded you will hear
 
04:05:13.510 --> 04:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
testimony that they have since the
 
04:05:15.950 --> 04:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
current Commissioners have put that in
 
04:05:20.189 --> 04:05:20.199 align:start position:0%
policy however policies can be changed
 
04:05:23.229 --> 04:05:23.239 align:start position:0%
policies do not have to be adhered to
 
04:05:26.590 --> 04:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
this is a public mountain and again it
 
04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
is owned by the county
 
04:05:30.429 --> 04:05:30.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and
 
04:05:33.510 --> 04:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
therefore it should be in statute that
 
04:05:37.070 --> 04:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
all meetings except those that are not
 
04:05:43.550 --> 04:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:46.389 --> 04:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
recorded and then the final section the
 
04:05:46.399 --> 04:05:48.110 align:start position:0%
recorded and then the final section the
forensic

04:05:48.110 --> 04:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
forensic
 
04:05:51.149 --> 04:05:51.159 align:start position:0%
audit the reason I'm bringing this forth
 
04:05:53.030 --> 04:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
and asking for it to be put
 
04:05:56.910 --> 04:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
in statute is
 
04:05:59.910 --> 04:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
one yes can we ask for a forensic audit
 
04:06:04.309 --> 04:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
of Gunstock yes is it subject to
 
04:06:08.189 --> 04:06:08.199 align:start position:0%
politics yes is it subject to the whim
 
04:06:11.309 --> 04:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
of whoever's on the delegation
 
04:06:14.070 --> 04:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
yes I have had experience at the county
 
04:06:16.670 --> 04:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
level when we wanted to do a forensic
 
04:06:19.110 --> 04:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
audit and was met
 
04:06:21.349 --> 04:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
with you know you're accusing us of
 
04:06:23.870 --> 04:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing a forensic audit is not
 
04:06:26.269 --> 04:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
accusing anyone of
 
04:06:28.670 --> 04:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing it is about keeping honest
 
04:06:28.680 --> 04:06:30.510 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing it is about keeping honest
people

04:06:30.510 --> 04:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
honest and then at the county level when
 
04:06:35.149 --> 04:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
we decided Well we won't you don't want
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
a forensic audit we do an audit
 
04:06:38.910 --> 04:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
committee they then asked us to do a
 
04:06:38.920 --> 04:06:40.149 align:start position:0%
committee they then asked us to do a
forensic

04:06:40.149 --> 04:06:40.159 align:start position:0%
forensic
 
04:06:43.550 --> 04:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
audit I mean that's how it's played out
 
04:06:45.750 --> 04:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
in politics
 
04:06:49.309 --> 04:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
right at Gunstock we're asking for a
 
04:06:51.950 --> 04:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
forensic audit to be done once every
 
04:06:56.309 --> 04:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
five years not every year but twice a
 
04:06:59.670 --> 04:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
decade and that would be a random year
 
04:07:02.070 --> 04:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
the first year to be audited would be
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:11.070 --> 04:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
2021 part of the reason for this is
 
04:07:15.510 --> 04:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
that what we found at Gunstock and that
 
04:07:19.429 --> 04:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
the traditional audit never caught was
 
04:07:21.750 --> 04:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
political contributions being
 
04:07:24.030 --> 04:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
made by the
 
04:07:27.830 --> 04:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
mountain that is taxpayer money whether
 
04:07:29.550 --> 04:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
you're a Democrat or
 
04:07:32.189 --> 04:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
Republican your County government should
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
not be giving money to political
 
04:07:36.720 --> 04:07:38.830 align:start position:0%
not be giving money to political
candidates

04:07:38.830 --> 04:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
04:07:42.070 --> 04:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
it was a public citizen that found this
 
04:07:45.429 --> 04:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
era and it had been going on for
 
04:07:48.710 --> 04:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:51.149 --> 04:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
decade the other thing you have to
 
04:07:55.149 --> 04:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:59.229 --> 04:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
done it doesn't look it looks at certain
 
04:08:02.670 --> 04:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
criteria it doesn't look at
 
04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
everything and it's also they put out
 
04:08:09.870 --> 04:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
questions they ask for certain
 
04:08:13.189 --> 04:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
information and if they can only go on
 
04:08:14.750 --> 04:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
the information
 
04:08:17.870 --> 04:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
given and I can let you know that I
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
originally I was assigned to an audit
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:26.990 --> 04:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
Gunstock it was disbanded pretty
 
04:08:29.710 --> 04:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
quickly but what I did discover in that
 
04:08:29.720 --> 04:08:30.830 align:start position:0%
quickly but what I did discover in that
short

04:08:30.830 --> 04:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
short
 
04:08:33.429 --> 04:08:33.439 align:start position:0%
time was that all the information that
 
04:08:35.750 --> 04:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
the Auditors asked for was not giving to
 
04:08:38.790 --> 04:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
them and I am quoting directly from the
 
04:08:41.910 --> 04:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
meeting that I was on a phone call with
 
04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
Auditors there are only two check
 
04:08:49.630 --> 04:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
signers and you you will hear that now
 
04:08:51.389 --> 04:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
the commission now is looking at the
 
04:08:53.830 --> 04:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
check register but a check register
 
04:08:55.870 --> 04:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
really doesn't do a whole
 
04:08:58.429 --> 04:08:58.439 align:start position:0%
lot it doesn't look at the small dollar
 
04:09:00.309 --> 04:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
amounts it doesn't look at the checks
 
04:09:01.990 --> 04:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
that had no endorsements on the back of
 
04:09:03.950 --> 04:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
them that were cash at other
 
04:09:06.510 --> 04:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
Banks this is what I
 
04:09:10.429 --> 04:09:10.439 align:start position:0%
discovered and I think it would be in
 
04:09:12.950 --> 04:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the county
 
04:09:16.030 --> 04:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to have this
 
04:09:18.750 --> 04:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
done I'm not saying that any wrongdoing
 
04:09:20.950 --> 04:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
has been
 
04:09:20.960 --> 04:09:22.830 align:start position:0%
has been
done

04:09:22.830 --> 04:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:09:25.630 --> 04:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
but it could someone
 
04:09:29.189 --> 04:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
could someone may have we don't know it
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
has never been done we know that they
 
04:09:33.710 --> 04:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
wrote checks out for political
 
04:09:35.670 --> 04:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
contributions and no one caught it for
 
04:09:40.790 --> 04:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:43.670 --> 04:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
years I will I will take any questions
 
04:09:45.590 --> 04:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
that the committee may
 
04:09:47.870 --> 04:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
have thank you for the testimony
 
04:09:47.880 --> 04:09:49.429 align:start position:0%
have thank you for the testimony
representative

04:09:49.429 --> 04:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:09:51.429 --> 04:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
majority thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:09:53.229 --> 04:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh just for
 
04:09:55.830 --> 04:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
clarity looking in in section three
 
04:09:57.309 --> 04:09:57.319 align:start position:0%
where you asked for the forensic audit
 
04:09:58.790 --> 04:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
to go back to
 
04:10:01.349 --> 04:10:01.359 align:start position:0%
2021 and and if I heard you correctly it
 
04:10:02.750 --> 04:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
was because there were political
 
04:10:05.670 --> 04:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
contributions that were made uh but this
 
04:10:07.149 --> 04:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
is where I want to get the clarity you
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
said going back at least a
 
04:10:11.790 --> 04:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
decade um and I just looked up real
 
04:10:13.550 --> 04:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
quick how many Republican versus
 
04:10:16.469 --> 04:10:16.479 align:start position:0%
Democrats so it seems like if that is if
 
04:10:17.790 --> 04:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
that is true the contributions would
 
04:10:21.030 --> 04:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
have been going to um uh candidates from
 
04:10:22.830 --> 04:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
both parties and I'm wondering if you
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
know what the Attorney General's opinion
 
04:10:27.790 --> 04:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
is on those contributions being made if
 
04:10:30.269 --> 04:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
those indeed were being made to both
 
04:10:32.109 --> 04:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
parties does that make the question make
 
04:10:33.870 --> 04:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
any sense thank you for your question
 
04:10:35.710 --> 04:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
and yes I can tell you that a cease and
 
04:10:37.790 --> 04:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
assist letter by the Attorney General
 
04:10:40.990 --> 04:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
was given to uh Tom
 
04:10:41.000 --> 04:10:42.950 align:start position:0%
was given to uh Tom
day

04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:10:45.670 --> 04:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner said well we put it
 
04:10:47.950 --> 04:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
in our policy that that can't happen
 
04:10:52.030 --> 04:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:56.590 --> 04:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
you repr with Holland thank you um so
 
04:10:58.910 --> 04:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a forensic audit once
 
04:11:02.630 --> 04:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
every five years currently does Gunstock
 
04:11:05.950 --> 04:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
or I mean I assume that uh in terms of
 
04:11:08.070 --> 04:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh your towns there I don't know how it
 
04:11:10.309 --> 04:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
works because it's County wise are
 
04:11:12.389 --> 04:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
conducting a yearly audit anyway that
 
04:11:14.910 --> 04:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
has you know focuses really on the
 
04:11:16.990 --> 04:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
financial control systems to stop a lot
 
04:11:18.950 --> 04:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
of what you're talking about is that
 
04:11:20.070 --> 04:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
actually occurring are you doing a
 
04:11:22.269 --> 04:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
yearly audit for the county thank you
 
04:11:23.950 --> 04:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yes Gunstock is
 
04:11:27.910 --> 04:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
required to have a yearly audit but as I
 
04:11:32.469 --> 04:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
stated a yearly audit doesn't delve into
 
04:11:36.750 --> 04:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
things um it's re they're based on what
 
04:11:37.950 --> 04:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
is given to to them what they've
 
04:11:39.269 --> 04:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
requested and what has been given to
 
04:11:43.630 --> 04:11:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:46.389 --> 04:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
minutia representative uh
 
04:11:48.429 --> 04:11:48.439 align:start position:0%
kill thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:11:52.710 --> 04:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you testified that
 
04:11:54.550 --> 04:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
specific political candidates had
 
04:11:55.990 --> 04:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
received contributions from from
 
04:11:58.149 --> 04:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
Gunstock can can you comment to which
 
04:12:00.149 --> 04:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
political candidates those
 
04:12:02.870 --> 04:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
were uh thank you for the question uh to
 
04:12:04.269 --> 04:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge they were
 
04:12:06.269 --> 04:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
candidates for
 
04:12:06.279 --> 04:12:10.510 align:start position:0%
candidates for
Governor

04:12:10.510 --> 04:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:10.520 --> 04:12:12.389 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:12:12.389 --> 04:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:12:15.510 --> 04:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:12:18.389 --> 04:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
welcome um do you know the cost of a
 
04:12:18.399 --> 04:12:19.990 align:start position:0%
welcome um do you know the cost of a
forensic

04:12:19.990 --> 04:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
forensic
 
04:12:22.590 --> 04:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
audit uh thank you for the question so a
 
04:12:24.229 --> 04:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
forensic audit can go anywhere from
 
04:12:26.510 --> 04:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
$5,000 to about
 
04:12:30.030 --> 04:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
$50,000 but if you a averaged a at the
 
04:12:32.590 --> 04:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
top end that would be about $110,000 per
 
04:12:35.030 --> 04:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
year if you ACR that
 
04:12:38.469 --> 04:12:38.479 align:start position:0%
expense thank you representative
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
04:12:44.269 --> 04:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so how is the 3%
 
04:12:47.790 --> 04:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
number to to go from 1.75 to
 
04:12:52.030 --> 04:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
3% uh thank you for that question um
 
04:12:54.910 --> 04:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
during the original B bill it was always
 
04:12:56.910 --> 04:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
intended to come back and revisit it
 
04:13:00.149 --> 04:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
that amount and originally I thought
 
04:13:02.269 --> 04:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
about going to the 5% that we originally
 
04:13:04.910 --> 04:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
going to do back when we first filed
 
04:13:07.710 --> 04:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
this method of payment but
 
04:13:11.429 --> 04:13:11.439 align:start position:0%
um I figured a modest increase of
 
04:13:13.710 --> 04:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
1.25% was a better
 
04:13:17.710 --> 04:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
approach um and please note that there's
 
04:13:20.349 --> 04:13:20.359 align:start position:0%
you know if they do well the county does
 
04:13:22.990 --> 04:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
well if they don't do well the county
 
04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
you know it's reliant on how well
 
04:13:28.189 --> 04:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
Gunstock does thank you follow up
 
04:13:31.109 --> 04:13:31.119 align:start position:0%
followup go ahead so is the Gunstock
 
04:13:36.149 --> 04:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:39.149 --> 04:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
county thank you for the question and
 
04:13:42.349 --> 04:13:42.359 align:start position:0%
that is the million dooll question it is
 
04:13:46.070 --> 04:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
a county-owned asset beloved by I'd say
 
04:13:49.309 --> 04:13:49.319 align:start position:0%
everybody in in the county I mean my
 
04:13:51.750 --> 04:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
kids and I both learn to uh snowboard
 
04:13:56.229 --> 04:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
there um every enjoys it it's beautiful
 
04:14:01.229 --> 04:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:04.750 --> 04:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
um but you have to understand that it is
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
the county
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that are on the hook if
 
04:14:11.950 --> 04:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
Gunstock ever defaults on
 
04:14:15.830 --> 04:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
anything so yes could it be a profit
 
04:14:20.149 --> 04:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
Center but we're also um the the so the
 
04:14:22.109 --> 04:14:22.119 align:start position:0%
county taxpayers should be the
 
04:14:25.990 --> 04:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
recipient of when they do well and when
 
04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
they don't do well well we have end up
 
04:14:29.590 --> 04:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
paying the
 
04:14:31.389 --> 04:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
bill thank
 
04:14:35.309 --> 04:14:35.319 align:start position:0%
you representative of power thank you Mr
 
04:14:36.590 --> 04:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:14:39.030 --> 04:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
question with regards to the profit the
 
04:14:40.309 --> 04:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
profits of
 
04:14:42.910 --> 04:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
Gunstock are you aware or do you know
 
04:14:45.149 --> 04:14:45.159 align:start position:0%
how the profits if there have been any
 
04:14:47.469 --> 04:14:47.479 align:start position:0%
in the past years how are they how was
 
04:14:49.790 --> 04:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
that money
 
04:14:54.349 --> 04:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
used um some of it's reinvested back
 
04:14:57.510 --> 04:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
into the mountain obviously they use it
 
04:14:58.950 --> 04:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
for operating
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
expenses the county does
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
enjoy uh this year we we got over
 
04:15:06.000 --> 04:15:07.510 align:start position:0%
enjoy uh this year we we got over
$300,000

04:15:07.510 --> 04:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
$300,000
 
04:15:10.469 --> 04:15:10.479 align:start position:0%
but we've also given Gunstock over a
 
04:15:12.630 --> 04:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars in Opera funds for
 
04:15:12.640 --> 04:15:13.870 align:start position:0%
million dollars in Opera funds for
Capital

04:15:13.870 --> 04:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
Capital
 
04:15:17.910 --> 04:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
Improvements and we have given
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
Gunstock a lot of dollars in the past
 
04:15:21.359 --> 04:15:23.349 align:start position:0%
Gunstock a lot of dollars in the past
for

04:15:23.349 --> 04:15:23.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:15:27.389 --> 04:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
defaults so I can't go into that but I
 
04:15:29.229 --> 04:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
am sure that there are many folks behind
 
04:15:32.030 --> 04:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
me that will give you a better answer
 
04:15:32.040 --> 04:15:33.590 align:start position:0%
me that will give you a better answer
than

04:15:33.590 --> 04:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:15:37.469 --> 04:15:37.479 align:start position:0%
I representative elt thank you Mr
 
04:15:39.750 --> 04:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:15:42.910 --> 04:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
question regarding uh the second issue
 
04:15:45.109 --> 04:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
about meetings to be recorded did you
 
04:15:48.510 --> 04:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
say that they already they currently are
 
04:15:50.710 --> 04:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
recording uh thank you for the question
 
04:15:53.229 --> 04:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
yes this current uh border Commissioners
 
04:15:55.309 --> 04:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
did put into a policy that they record
 
04:15:56.710 --> 04:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
the Gunstock
 
04:16:00.309 --> 04:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
meetings but it is only a policy which
 
04:16:03.229 --> 04:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
means they do not have to if they don't
 
04:16:05.910 --> 04:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
want to thank
 
04:16:05.920 --> 04:16:08.269 align:start position:0%
want to thank
you

04:16:08.269 --> 04:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative correct thank you Mr
 
04:16:12.630 --> 04:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:16:15.910 --> 04:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
question um on the subject of your
 
04:16:19.750 --> 04:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
contribution to the county uh I'm not
 
04:16:22.670 --> 04:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
sure that I understand why it's based on
 
04:16:26.590 --> 04:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
the gross operating or the gross revenue
 
04:16:29.269 --> 04:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
less uh donations and
 
04:16:34.429 --> 04:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
grants um rather than
 
04:16:38.389 --> 04:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
um your quote profit after
 
04:16:40.830 --> 04:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
expenses could you please explain why
 
04:16:42.750 --> 04:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
that uh the
 
04:16:46.510 --> 04:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
rationale thank you for the question
 
04:16:48.910 --> 04:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
representative well the reason it went
 
04:16:52.830 --> 04:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:55.950 --> 04:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
because there was a lot of questions uh
 
04:17:00.189 --> 04:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
in the previous years with uh use meming
 
04:17:03.790 --> 04:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
of understandings um with what actual
 
04:17:03.800 --> 04:17:05.229 align:start position:0%
of understandings um with what actual
profit

04:17:05.229 --> 04:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
profit
 
04:17:07.830 --> 04:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
was um did it
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
include uh the depreciation which is a
 
04:17:15.710 --> 04:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
non-cash item was it uh how was it
 
04:17:18.429 --> 04:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
accounted for did we move things around
 
04:17:20.349 --> 04:17:20.359 align:start position:0%
to make it look like there was a less
 
04:17:23.510 --> 04:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
profit I am not suggesting that that was
 
04:17:26.309 --> 04:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
done but if you use depreciation and
 
04:17:28.910 --> 04:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
amortization and you deduct that from
 
04:17:28.920 --> 04:17:30.469 align:start position:0%
amortization and you deduct that from
your

04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:17:33.550 --> 04:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
profit you're you're that is a non-cash
 
04:17:35.910 --> 04:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
item that does that would have a drastic
 
04:17:39.389 --> 04:17:39.399 align:start position:0%
effect on what is given to the
 
04:17:43.349 --> 04:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
county followup Please Mr chair go ahead
 
04:17:47.590 --> 04:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
um so if let's say for example this
 
04:17:53.229 --> 04:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
year um you had to replace a ski
 
04:17:58.710 --> 04:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
lift your profit would be wiped out but
 
04:18:00.750 --> 04:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
you but you did have enough money to
 
04:18:03.469 --> 04:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
replace that ski lift would you then
 
04:18:05.189 --> 04:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
still owe the
 
04:18:08.750 --> 04:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:11.070 --> 04:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the
 
04:18:15.630 --> 04:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
question so we have a formula here um
 
04:18:17.790 --> 04:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
Gunstock has been thriving for the past
 
04:18:22.109 --> 04:18:22.119 align:start position:0%
few few years um but in previous years
 
04:18:24.550 --> 04:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
before that they used to come to the
 
04:18:28.950 --> 04:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
county and ask for a for for better
 
04:18:34.229 --> 04:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
terms a loan um and the county taxpayers
 
04:18:37.229 --> 04:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
or the delegation would grant that loan
 
04:18:39.030 --> 04:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
so that it would tie them over until
 
04:18:40.670 --> 04:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
they got into the winter season and
 
04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
started with their operating revenues
 
04:18:46.389 --> 04:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
again but they're like I
 
04:18:49.750 --> 04:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
said uh they haven't done that for a
 
04:18:52.950 --> 04:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
while but it is the county taxpayers no
 
04:18:56.950 --> 04:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
matter how you slice this that is
 
04:19:00.510 --> 04:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for the debts of Gunstock if
 
04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:08.710 --> 04:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
cash represent Elward thank you Mr

chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:19:14.710 --> 04:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
question over the last decade let's say
 
04:19:16.910 --> 04:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
approximately has the
 
04:19:21.990 --> 04:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
gross revenue increased or decreased on
 
04:19:24.910 --> 04:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
average I would say uh thank you for the
 
04:19:28.389 --> 04:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
question again um I would say under the
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:38.189 --> 04:19:38.199 align:start position:0%

four and four Republicans being
 
04:21:35.950 --> 04:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
against public input from uh from the

04:21:42.030 --> 04:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
chairman of the Gunstock area commission

um provided their thoughts on this bill
 
04:21:51.750 --> 04:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
and his thoughts were I'm going to make
 
04:21:54.870 --> 04:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
a synopsis you can go into it in deeper
 
04:21:57.149 --> 04:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
terms to increase the percentage payable
 
04:21:59.830 --> 04:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
to the bellnap county of
 
04:22:04.750 --> 04:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
1.75% of gross revenues to 3% of gross
 
04:22:07.590 --> 04:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
revenues could put undue Financial
 
04:22:10.429 --> 04:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
pressure on Gunstock Mountain Resort
 
04:22:12.750 --> 04:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
this could impact employment maintenance
 
04:22:16.109 --> 04:22:16.119 align:start position:0%
and future projects secondly as a
 
04:22:19.630 --> 04:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
fingent atic the delegation AR already
 
04:22:23.189 --> 04:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
retains the right by vote to request a
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
forensic audit and lastly the guny area
 
04:22:31.309 --> 04:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
committee also records their meetings so
 
04:22:34.510 --> 04:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
all aspects of this bill are
 
04:22:38.109 --> 04:22:38.119 align:start position:0%
currently uh taking
 
04:22:40.670 --> 04:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
place and
 
04:22:44.229 --> 04:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
as the uh sponsor of the bill indicated
 
04:22:46.950 --> 04:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
that even though they were policies
 
04:22:48.950 --> 04:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
instituted by the
 
04:22:51.590 --> 04:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
committee and that the committee could
 
04:22:55.469 --> 04:22:55.479 align:start position:0%
change it well we all sit here changing
 
04:23:00.790 --> 04:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
rsas also so as one cycle we can change
 
04:23:03.550 --> 04:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
in RSA the next cycle we can change in
 
04:23:08.830 --> 04:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
RSA again so but the we don't set up
 
04:23:11.269 --> 04:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
policies and stuff with the intent of
 
04:23:13.550 --> 04:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
knowing that we're going to change it we
 
04:23:15.910 --> 04:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
do this with the goodness of knowing
 
04:23:18.229 --> 04:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
that we want to fulfill something that
 
04:23:23.309 --> 04:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
the general public finds is needed in
 
04:23:26.429 --> 04:23:26.439 align:start position:0%
which case the Gunstock committee itself
 
04:23:29.870 --> 04:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
indicated it was needed to so that bnap
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:35.279 --> 04:23:37.309 align:start position:0%
 
tape

04:23:37.309 --> 04:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
tape
 
04:23:39.510 --> 04:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
so the delegation discussion the
 
04:23:41.790 --> 04:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
delegation agreed that increasing the
 
04:23:45.429 --> 04:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
percentage payable to belck County from
 
04:23:48.630 --> 04:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
1.75% of gross
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
revenue and I want I just want to make a
 
04:23:53.790 --> 04:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
comment with the gross revenues think
 
04:23:57.990 --> 04:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
about any company that you would say I
 
04:24:00.269 --> 04:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
want to take
 
04:24:02.830 --> 04:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
1.75% right off the
 
04:24:07.550 --> 04:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
top Le on now I want to take 3% % right
 
04:24:12.070 --> 04:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
off the top and think about how would a
 
04:24:15.109 --> 04:24:15.119 align:start position:0%
company survive knowing right out of the
 
04:24:20.870 --> 04:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:24.189 --> 04:24:24.199 align:start position:0%
gross before you buy any more equipment
 
04:24:27.070 --> 04:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
before you buy or pay for your labor
 
04:24:29.630 --> 04:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
your health care or anything else you're
 
04:24:32.590 --> 04:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
going to take this right off the top so
 
04:24:35.349 --> 04:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
if that's not a crippling effect I'm not
 
04:24:37.349 --> 04:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
quite sure what what would
 
04:24:37.359 --> 04:24:41.830 align:start position:0%
quite sure what what would
be

04:24:41.830 --> 04:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:45.630 --> 04:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
um now we also have I don't think
 
04:24:48.349 --> 04:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
anybody's from the counties here the
 
04:24:51.910 --> 04:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
county also had a meeting the Board of
 
04:24:54.469 --> 04:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and they also
 
04:24:58.189 --> 04:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
voted in their meeting to
 
04:25:01.710 --> 04:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
itl so the the County Commission itself
 
04:25:05.070 --> 04:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
does not support this bill in any aspect
 
04:25:05.080 --> 04:25:06.670 align:start position:0%
does not support this bill in any aspect
whatsoever

04:25:06.670 --> 04:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
04:25:09.309 --> 04:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
the county delegation does not support
 
04:25:11.269 --> 04:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
this bill in
 
04:25:11.279 --> 04:25:13.790 align:start position:0%
this bill in
any

04:25:13.790 --> 04:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:25:17.309 --> 04:25:17.319 align:start position:0%
fashion and I'm gonna let the the uh
 
04:25:20.189 --> 04:25:20.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner is here for Gunstock and
 
04:25:22.229 --> 04:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
I'll let him speak for
 
04:25:22.239 --> 04:25:24.309 align:start position:0%
I'll let him speak for
himself

04:25:24.309 --> 04:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
himself
 
04:25:28.870 --> 04:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
so the forensic AIT itself as we did
 
04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
have one and it did show there was uh
 
04:25:36.630 --> 04:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
one adjustment that needed and and the
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
letter was written and that has been
 
04:25:43.349 --> 04:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
taken care of that was the uh
 
04:25:48.070 --> 04:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
$5,000 checks that were written for uh
 
04:25:50.630 --> 04:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
whoever's campaign it was it was written
 
04:25:54.269 --> 04:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
to and by the end of it all being done
 
04:25:56.990 --> 04:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
it was an over a
 
04:25:57.000 --> 04:25:59.349 align:start position:0%
it was an over a
$50,000

04:25:59.349 --> 04:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
$50,000
 
04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:08.309 --> 04:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
$5,000 done now to me I'm not quite sure
 
04:26:10.790 --> 04:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's a good return on your investment
 
04:26:14.349 --> 04:26:14.359 align:start position:0%
as a county taxpayer
 
04:26:18.229 --> 04:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
because the taxpayer was on the hook for
 
04:26:21.590 --> 04:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
all of this money so as we keep trying
 
04:26:25.550 --> 04:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
to save our our taxpayer by charging
 
04:26:27.990 --> 04:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
them more
 
04:26:31.429 --> 04:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
money for something that can be done by
 
04:26:31.439 --> 04:26:32.389 align:start position:0%
money for something that can be done by
the

04:26:32.389 --> 04:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:26:32.399 --> 04:26:34.510 align:start position:0%
the
delegation

04:26:34.510 --> 04:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
04:26:38.790 --> 04:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
anyway so with that I'm done and I'm
 
04:26:42.990 --> 04:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:46.030 --> 04:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative power thank you
 
04:26:47.469 --> 04:26:47.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:26:49.510 --> 04:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
question I missed what you did you say
 
04:26:50.710 --> 04:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:26:53.149 --> 04:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
donations the improper
 
04:26:56.510 --> 04:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
donations that were made through to the
 
04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
to the governor race did you was not
 
04:27:04.269 --> 04:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
determined to be improper until after
 
04:27:06.670 --> 04:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office did the
 
04:27:09.590 --> 04:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
research and stuff the verbiage that was
 
04:27:13.389 --> 04:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
in all of the documents that were
 
04:27:17.630 --> 04:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
available at that time left it unclear
 
04:27:20.750 --> 04:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's why the yearly audits missed it
 
04:27:23.030 --> 04:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
because it was unclear that they were
 
04:27:26.269 --> 04:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
actually doing something wrong there was
 
04:27:30.790 --> 04:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
nothing phous going on there was nothing
 
04:27:34.870 --> 04:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
to where they were intentionally trying
 
04:27:38.269 --> 04:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
to take tax taxpayers money and and give
 
04:27:42.670 --> 04:27:42.680 align:start position:0%
it away uh to candidates and stuff it
 
04:27:44.790 --> 04:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
was the way the paperwork was the
 
04:27:47.189 --> 04:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office made their
 
04:27:49.630 --> 04:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
determination they sent the letter and
 
04:27:53.469 --> 04:27:53.479 align:start position:0%
it's been corrected since then yes
 
04:27:56.189 --> 04:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
follow go ahead thank you Mr chair
 
04:27:59.670 --> 04:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
um that was an answer to a question I
 
04:28:03.030 --> 04:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
kind I wasn't asking I was trying to
 
04:28:07.469 --> 04:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
find out how much money had been
 
04:28:11.030 --> 04:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
donated this was to cover a $5,000
 
04:28:12.950 --> 04:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's all I was thank you for verifying
 
04:28:12.960 --> 04:28:17.469 align:start position:0%
that's all I was thank you for verifying
that

04:28:17.469 --> 04:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:20.670 --> 04:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
thanks excuse me representative kill
 
04:28:21.910 --> 04:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:28:23.790 --> 04:28:23.800 align:start position:0%
my question we heard previous testimony
 
04:28:26.630 --> 04:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
that the payments went on for a decade
 
04:28:29.309 --> 04:28:29.319 align:start position:0%
so if it went on for 10 years wouldn't
 
04:28:30.469 --> 04:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
that be
 
04:28:33.790 --> 04:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
$50,000 I'm
 
04:28:40.269 --> 04:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
not aware of of how much that is uh over
 
04:28:43.870 --> 04:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
the years but it was not hidden to the
 
04:28:47.109 --> 04:28:47.119 align:start position:0%
fact quick quick followup go ahead do
 
04:28:48.670 --> 04:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
you think it's appropriate for any
 
04:28:50.389 --> 04:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars to be going towards a
 
04:28:54.070 --> 04:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
candidate no I do not and that is why
 
04:28:56.109 --> 04:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
it's been rectified when this was
 
04:28:58.429 --> 04:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
brought to everybody's attention it has
 
04:28:58.439 --> 04:29:01.550 align:start position:0%
brought to everybody's attention it has
been

04:29:01.550 --> 04:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:04.469 --> 04:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
rectified representative Gilman thank
 
04:29:06.309 --> 04:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:29:09.269 --> 04:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
question um in the uh letter of
 
04:29:12.510 --> 04:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
testimony from the Gunstock area
 
04:29:15.149 --> 04:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
commission they refer to an amount that
 
04:29:18.630 --> 04:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
was actually borrowed from the county um
 
04:29:22.269 --> 04:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
as a revenue anticipation note do you
 
04:29:26.389 --> 04:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
know I I'm assuming but do you know uh
 
04:29:29.750 --> 04:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
that that Revenue anticipation note was
 
04:29:32.910 --> 04:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
paid because it's in anticipation of
 
04:29:35.469 --> 04:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
getting the revenue in a seasonal place
 
04:29:38.109 --> 04:29:38.119 align:start position:0%
is going to anticipate getting Revenue
 
04:29:41.990 --> 04:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
at a these notes have all been paid back
 
04:29:44.910 --> 04:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
there was nothing held onto the
 
04:29:44.920 --> 04:29:46.750 align:start position:0%
there was nothing held onto the
taxpayers

04:29:46.750 --> 04:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
04:29:51.469 --> 04:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
uh coughers to do this and then actually
 
04:29:53.950 --> 04:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
it was a bond they covered a bond to
 
04:29:56.349 --> 04:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
give them through to the point where
 
04:29:59.950 --> 04:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
they can uh operate into this and the
 
04:30:03.590 --> 04:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
last several years they have uh improved
 
04:30:05.990 --> 04:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
themselves so that they have not had to
 
04:30:10.950 --> 04:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:13.990 --> 04:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
bonds representative PR again thank you
 
04:30:16.590 --> 04:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh thank you for taking my
 
04:30:20.269 --> 04:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
question previous testimony I believe
 
04:30:23.309 --> 04:30:23.319 align:start position:0%
indicated that there were one or more
 
04:30:26.149 --> 04:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
defaults on money lent from the county
 
04:30:28.750 --> 04:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
can you elaborate on that for us I'm not
 
04:30:33.109 --> 04:30:33.119 align:start position:0%
aware of any defaults um I'm sure the uh
 
04:30:35.830 --> 04:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
committee chairman and Dom delay who
 
04:30:38.189 --> 04:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
might be speaking also would be able to
 
04:30:42.030 --> 04:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:44.710 --> 04:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
question okay seeing no more questions
 
04:30:45.830 --> 04:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:30:47.469 --> 04:30:47.479 align:start position:0%
representative bogert uh just for those
 
04:30:50.109 --> 04:30:50.119 align:start position:0%
in the audience uh so you're aware we go
 
04:30:52.429 --> 04:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
through the representatives first before
 
04:30:56.229 --> 04:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
we uh go to anybody else besides a rep
 
04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:04.560 --> 04:31:08.269 align:start position:0%
 
mcarter

04:31:08.269 --> 04:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:10.189 --> 04:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you committee
 
04:31:12.389 --> 04:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
I'm getting over a sinus infection so I
 
04:31:14.429 --> 04:31:14.439 align:start position:0%
don't always sound like this sound kind
 
04:31:17.149 --> 04:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
of like a robot um I don't really have
 
04:31:19.389 --> 04:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
anything to contribute with regards to
 
04:31:22.830 --> 04:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
questions about the financial health or
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh non-health about the Gunstock
 
04:31:28.910 --> 04:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
Mountain what I can contribute is for
 
04:31:31.030 --> 04:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
some reason Gunstock is a political
 
04:31:33.910 --> 04:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
lightning rod you are probably all very
 
04:31:37.910 --> 04:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
well aware of this um um in my opinion
 
04:31:40.830 --> 04:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
being a county owned facility like
 
04:31:44.670 --> 04:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
Gunstock is it should be a revenue
 
04:31:47.389 --> 04:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
Center not a profit Center and I think
 
04:31:49.109 --> 04:31:49.119 align:start position:0%
that is a huge distinction that needs to
 
04:31:52.510 --> 04:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
be made so I don't believe that the
 
04:31:55.469 --> 04:31:55.479 align:start position:0%
3% uh that this bill States uh would
 
04:31:58.109 --> 04:31:58.119 align:start position:0%
come back to the county is a lot to ask
 
04:32:00.590 --> 04:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
when my property tax is living in belnap
 
04:32:03.349 --> 04:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
County are approaching $10,000 a year
 
04:32:05.830 --> 04:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
for a very modest home at and I'm not
 
04:32:10.109 --> 04:32:10.119 align:start position:0%
alone there so I think the uh newspapers
 
04:32:12.309 --> 04:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
up there touting how successful and
 
04:32:14.590 --> 04:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
wonderful Gunstock is it's a valuable
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
resource for anyone to come to it really
 
04:32:19.590 --> 04:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
is it's a beautiful place uh if it's
 
04:32:21.790 --> 04:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
there truly for the benefit of belnap
 
04:32:24.790 --> 04:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
County then the profits should be sent
 
04:32:27.229 --> 04:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
back to the residents of belnap County
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your time any questions
 
04:32:31.070 --> 04:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:32:33.910 --> 04:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you for your
 
04:32:36.469 --> 04:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
testimony uh next up representative
 
04:32:36.479 --> 04:32:43.349 align:start position:0%
testimony uh next up representative
Harvey

04:32:43.349 --> 04:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:46.109 --> 04:32:46.119 align:start position:0%
bolier thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:32:48.349 --> 04:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
members of the municipal committee my
 
04:32:50.590 --> 04:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
name is representative Juliet Harvey
 
04:32:53.189 --> 04:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
bully I represent home in samton for the
 
04:32:57.830 --> 04:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
record in Bop County and um I'm uh
 
04:33:00.670 --> 04:33:00.680 align:start position:0%
speaking against the bill and I won't
 
04:33:02.070 --> 04:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
take up too much of your time because
 
04:33:04.750 --> 04:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
the main reason is uh we haven't had a
 
04:33:08.269 --> 04:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
chance or opportunity to discuss this in
 
04:33:11.269 --> 04:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
our delegation meetings so we we have
 
04:33:16.709 --> 04:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
not um debated this issue we haven't um
 
04:33:19.590 --> 04:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
discussed different percentages and I'm
 
04:33:23.390 --> 04:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
not um particularly opposed to changing
 
04:33:27.429 --> 04:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
the amount either but I think it's um
 
04:33:29.830 --> 04:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
probably the most prudent thing to do
 
04:33:32.910 --> 04:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
would be for um us delegates to come
 
04:33:35.750 --> 04:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
together discuss the changes the pro the
 
04:33:38.070 --> 04:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
cons and and how it should should be
 
04:33:41.670 --> 04:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
dealt with over the long term 10 years
 
04:33:45.349 --> 04:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
or so um you've got to weigh things like
 
04:33:45.359 --> 04:33:46.189 align:start position:0%
or so um you've got to weigh things like
uh

04:33:46.189 --> 04:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:49.949 --> 04:33:49.959 align:start position:0%
weather um years where Gunstock is going
 
04:33:51.670 --> 04:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
to have fewer
 
04:33:53.869 --> 04:33:53.879 align:start position:0%
profits there's so many different
 
04:33:57.029 --> 04:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
variables that we really need to discuss
 
04:33:59.990 --> 04:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
um and and that is how we came to you
 
04:34:02.109 --> 04:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
know what it how the law is written
 
04:34:04.990 --> 04:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
today and the amount the percentage that
 
04:34:08.750 --> 04:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
is currently um on the record uh a
 
04:34:11.470 --> 04:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
number of years ago representative Dum
 
04:34:14.670 --> 04:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
reminded us um that we got together that
 
04:34:16.750 --> 04:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
the delegation got together and really
 
04:34:19.910 --> 04:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
worked very hard to come up with the 1%
 
04:34:22.150 --> 04:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
that's in the law that's written as it
 
04:34:25.869 --> 04:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
is today and it came about as a as quite
 
04:34:29.390 --> 04:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
a bit of hard work uh that the whole
 
04:34:33.349 --> 04:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
delegation was involved in and um I
 
04:34:35.830 --> 04:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
think you know that that is
 
04:34:38.750 --> 04:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
going to be the wisest way forward is
 
04:34:41.230 --> 04:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
for us to decide as a delegation and
 
04:34:44.070 --> 04:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
then come to you folks in committee
 
04:34:45.551 --> 04:34:45.561 align:start position:0%
unless of course you would like to see
 
04:34:49.590 --> 04:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
us back every single year with changes
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
to this percentage going up and down and
 
04:34:56.551 --> 04:34:56.561 align:start position:0%
um that is my biggest argument against
 
04:34:58.949 --> 04:34:58.959 align:start position:0%
the bill as it as is as it is written
 
04:35:02.830 --> 04:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
today is that it was not a product of
 
04:35:05.830 --> 04:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
the delegation as a whole uh and I just
 
04:35:07.551 --> 04:35:07.561 align:start position:0%
wanted to also say that representative
 
04:35:09.590 --> 04:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
Harry Bean who's the chair would like to
 
04:35:13.070 --> 04:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
be here he asked me to at tell you that
 
04:35:15.269 --> 04:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
he is opposed to the bill and he has uh
 
04:35:17.470 --> 04:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony to that
 
04:35:22.269 --> 04:35:22.279 align:start position:0%
effect um and other than that um thank
 
04:35:26.029 --> 04:35:26.039 align:start position:0%
you for your time unless you have any
 
04:35:29.230 --> 04:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:35:31.349 --> 04:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:35:33.869 --> 04:35:33.879 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I need some
 
04:35:35.910 --> 04:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
clarification so in your your testimony
 
04:35:38.910 --> 04:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
you stated that the the belnap county
 
04:35:41.670 --> 04:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
delegation had not had the opportunity
 
04:35:45.709 --> 04:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
to discuss this bill and the issue here
 
04:35:49.150 --> 04:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
at hand however as a Committee Member I
 
04:35:51.390 --> 04:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
I have a letter that says that on
 
04:35:51.400 --> 04:35:52.750 align:start position:0%
I have a letter that says that on
December

04:35:52.750 --> 04:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
December
 
04:35:52.760 --> 04:35:54.830 align:start position:0%
December
14th

04:35:54.830 --> 04:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
14th
 
04:35:58.310 --> 04:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
2023 that the bellnap county delegation
 
04:36:00.990 --> 04:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
both discussed and voted on a
 
04:36:03.310 --> 04:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation with regards to this bill
 
04:36:04.750 --> 04:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
and it was signed by the chair of the
 
04:36:07.709 --> 04:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
Bell County delegation so I'm just
 
04:36:10.429 --> 04:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
confused as to what actually took place
 
04:36:14.150 --> 04:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
and in your statement did you means what
 
04:36:16.470 --> 04:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
did you mean by your statement thank you
 
04:36:18.750 --> 04:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
very much um for allowing me to clarify
 
04:36:22.910 --> 04:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
that um I believe I said it's not a the
 
04:36:27.470 --> 04:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
the uh the 3% for instance the the
 
04:36:30.709 --> 04:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
verbiage in the bill was not a product
 
04:36:34.709 --> 04:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
of a subcommittee or any sort of um it
 
04:36:37.189 --> 04:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
was never even on the agenda prior to
 
04:36:40.910 --> 04:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
the time that we voted so we knew that
 
04:36:42.670 --> 04:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
um the committee was going to hear the
 
04:36:45.029 --> 04:36:45.039 align:start position:0%
the we didn't have time
 
04:36:47.990 --> 04:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
to uh even talk about amendments we
 
04:36:50.789 --> 04:36:50.799 align:start position:0%
simply took a vote because of the
 
04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
upcoming hearing um but in years
 
04:36:58.029 --> 04:36:58.039 align:start position:0%
past rep according to representative D
 
04:37:00.910 --> 04:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
who was there at the time a couple terms
 
04:37:04.510 --> 04:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
back he said that the whole delegation
 
04:37:06.709 --> 04:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
had work worked on it for instance in a
 
04:37:08.949 --> 04:37:08.959 align:start position:0%
subcommittee although I I'm not sure if
 
04:37:10.510 --> 04:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
it was a subcommittee at the time but I
 
04:37:13.949 --> 04:37:13.959 align:start position:0%
can get that information and it took it
 
04:37:15.910 --> 04:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
sounded like several months to come up
 
04:37:25.029 --> 04:37:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:29.869 --> 04:37:29.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:32.910 --> 04:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
still representative
 
04:37:35.949 --> 04:37:35.959 align:start position:0%
Gallagher so you mentioned
 
04:37:40.590 --> 04:37:40.600 align:start position:0%
um that the delegation had had a chance
 
04:37:45.109 --> 04:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
to um give feedback on it uh so I'm
 
04:37:47.910 --> 04:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
wondering is is that something the
 
04:37:51.269 --> 04:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
bellat county delegation normally does
 
04:37:53.830 --> 04:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
about legislation because at least in my
 
04:37:56.109 --> 04:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
County delegation the mar County
 
04:37:59.109 --> 04:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
delegation I can't remember ever having
 
04:38:03.629 --> 04:38:03.639 align:start position:0%
had a time where we've voted on
 
04:38:06.551 --> 04:38:06.561 align:start position:0%
legislation that was than to be
 
04:38:10.070 --> 04:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
considered by the rest of the house we
 
04:38:13.029 --> 04:38:13.039 align:start position:0%
generally just stick to the
 
04:38:18.109 --> 04:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
budget um stuff so can you um tell me
 
04:38:19.230 --> 04:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
what you mean
 
04:38:19.240 --> 04:38:23.109 align:start position:0%
what you mean
[Music]

04:38:23.109 --> 04:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:26.949 --> 04:38:26.959 align:start position:0%
there um I'll do my best I'm I'm I think
 
04:38:30.150 --> 04:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
the question is have we ever discussed
 
04:38:33.070 --> 04:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
things before as a delegation as far
 
04:38:35.830 --> 04:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
as statutory law law that's going to be
 
04:38:38.990 --> 04:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
heard is that the
 
04:38:41.750 --> 04:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
question um yeah basically is this is
 
04:38:44.990 --> 04:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
this normal PR would doing so be normal
 
04:38:47.869 --> 04:38:47.879 align:start position:0%
practice for your
 
04:38:50.670 --> 04:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
delegation um thank you for that um I
 
04:38:53.949 --> 04:38:53.959 align:start position:0%
know we have not um to be honest excuse
 
04:38:56.510 --> 04:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
me we haven't uh discussed anything but
 
04:38:58.990 --> 04:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
there was a bill before your committee
 
04:39:01.310 --> 04:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
last year I believe it had to do with
 
04:39:05.029 --> 04:39:05.039 align:start position:0%
term uh length of term for Sheriff's the
 
04:39:05.039 --> 04:39:06.390 align:start position:0%
term uh length of term for Sheriff's the
sheriff's

04:39:06.390 --> 04:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
sheriff's
 
04:39:10.750 --> 04:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh um position and I think one of the
 
04:39:13.869 --> 04:39:13.879 align:start position:0%
reasons and I'm just guessing one of the
 
04:39:17.070 --> 04:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
reasons it it didn't pass is because we
 
04:39:19.750 --> 04:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have any kind of opinion from the
 
04:39:21.910 --> 04:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
county the county didn't decide on this
 
04:39:25.070 --> 04:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
and then present it to Municipal now I
 
04:39:27.269 --> 04:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
could be that is just the uh the Scuttle
 
04:39:29.590 --> 04:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
butt I heard about that but I I think
 
04:39:32.590 --> 04:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
it's personally I think it's a good
 
04:39:34.789 --> 04:39:34.799 align:start position:0%
practice and I'm hoping that moving
 
04:39:36.708 --> 04:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
moving forward with our County
 
04:39:39.830 --> 04:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
delegation if we have such um
 
04:39:42.788 --> 04:39:42.798 align:start position:0%
legislation going forward that we all
 
04:39:45.030 --> 04:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
get the opportunity to address it and
 
04:39:48.070 --> 04:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
put it on the agenda at least and um
 
04:39:49.830 --> 04:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
discuss it it would be nice to have a
 
04:39:53.270 --> 04:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
vote before we go and um bring it
 
04:39:55.948 --> 04:39:55.958 align:start position:0%
presented to the municipal committee and
 
04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
and take up your valuable
 
04:40:00.868 --> 04:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
time thank
 
04:40:04.350 --> 04:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
04:40:04.360 --> 04:40:05.390 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
kahill

04:40:05.390 --> 04:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
kahill
 
04:40:06.708 --> 04:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:40:08.230 --> 04:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
my question I was I was just looking
 
04:40:10.310 --> 04:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
some for some clarification on
 
04:40:11.868 --> 04:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
representative Po's question I I was
 
04:40:13.670 --> 04:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
going to ask the same question we just
 
04:40:16.070 --> 04:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from the previous um
 
04:40:18.868 --> 04:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
gentleman that you guys met and voted on
 
04:40:21.590 --> 04:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
it as a delegation to decide whether or
 
04:40:23.788 --> 04:40:23.798 align:start position:0%
not this should go
 
04:40:26.868 --> 04:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
forward and I guess my question is what
 
04:40:28.510 --> 04:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
did you vote on did did you look at the
 
04:40:32.430 --> 04:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:36.150 --> 04:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
vote um thank you for the question
 
04:40:38.470 --> 04:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative K Hill uh we didn't
 
04:40:41.030 --> 04:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
really de I mean to my recollection we
 
04:40:43.030 --> 04:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
did not uh
 
04:40:46.590 --> 04:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
debate the merits of the bill the bill
 
04:40:49.310 --> 04:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
was the language was passed
 
04:40:53.708 --> 04:40:53.718 align:start position:0%
out um and yes we did discuss the
 
04:40:57.310 --> 04:40:57.320 align:start position:0%
procedure for the vote what it meant we
 
04:41:01.110 --> 04:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh didn't discuss it in in depth um but
 
04:41:03.590 --> 04:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
it was you know obviously it's presented
 
04:41:05.750 --> 04:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
and and we V voted on it but it was
 
04:41:09.150 --> 04:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
rather quick because as I said before we
 
04:41:10.470 --> 04:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
knew that it was coming before the
 
04:41:13.708 --> 04:41:13.718 align:start position:0%
committee and it would be wises to make
 
04:41:15.510 --> 04:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
a a
 
04:41:18.750 --> 04:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation um to present to your
 
04:41:21.350 --> 04:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
committee but no we we've never had it
 
04:41:25.190 --> 04:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
on an agenda formally in our delegation
 
04:41:28.830 --> 04:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
and we certainly didn't debate
 
04:41:31.868 --> 04:41:31.878 align:start position:0%
on um what sort
 
04:41:35.110 --> 04:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
of percentage would be appropriate what
 
04:41:38.150 --> 04:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
are some of the long-term impacts um are
 
04:41:40.350 --> 04:41:40.360 align:start position:0%
we going to make this change every year
 
04:41:43.070 --> 04:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
seasonally or are we going to um is
 
04:41:44.550 --> 04:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
gunar going to have a bad year and then
 
04:41:47.390 --> 04:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a new um percentage
 
04:41:50.310 --> 04:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
to bring before the um committee is it
 
04:41:53.270 --> 04:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
going to go like that every few years we
 
04:41:56.110 --> 04:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
change so we didn't uh it was it was
 
04:41:59.310 --> 04:41:59.320 align:start position:0%
pretty cursory I have to to say I hope
 
04:42:00.948 --> 04:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
that answers your
 
04:42:03.230 --> 04:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
04:42:05.708 --> 04:42:05.718 align:start position:0%
yella thank you
 
04:42:08.708 --> 04:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question um
 
04:42:11.948 --> 04:42:11.958 align:start position:0%
prior to the legislation being submitted
 
04:42:16.470 --> 04:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
did you are you aware of any
 
04:42:19.270 --> 04:42:19.280 align:start position:0%

additional information or um are you
 
04:42:36.788 --> 04:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
essentially waiting for for for the the
 
04:42:39.830 --> 04:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
state to decide make movement on that
 
04:42:43.150 --> 04:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
before you take any action thank you um
 
04:42:47.110 --> 04:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yella um
 
04:42:51.350 --> 04:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
I'm uh I'm not aware of um first we
 
04:42:53.190 --> 04:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
didn't even I didn't even see because
 
04:42:56.310 --> 04:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
the bill was um the verbiage of the bill
 
04:42:58.430 --> 04:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't available for quite a while it
 
04:43:02.628 --> 04:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
was um is we knew that there was a bill
 
04:43:04.550 --> 04:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh to do with an LSR to do with gun
 
04:43:06.190 --> 04:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
stock but we we couldn't actually read
 
04:43:08.868 --> 04:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
it um so we got that fairly late in the
 
04:43:13.550 --> 04:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
game and I am not aware of anything I'm
 
04:43:17.030 --> 04:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
only aware that a couple terms back
 
04:43:19.390 --> 04:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
representative D said that they as a
 
04:43:22.270 --> 04:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
delegation worked on it at length
 
04:43:25.030 --> 04:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps over a number of months to come
 
04:43:26.590 --> 04:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
up with the
 
04:43:28.910 --> 04:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
1.75% and then since then it's never
 
04:43:31.350 --> 04:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
been raised in delegation like let's
 
04:43:31.360 --> 04:43:32.510 align:start position:0%
been raised in delegation like let's
change

04:43:32.510 --> 04:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:43:36.030 --> 04:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
it uh you you know it was never on the
 
04:43:37.868 --> 04:43:37.878 align:start position:0%
agenda at all or discussed in any way
 
04:43:41.708 --> 04:43:41.718 align:start position:0%
that I have any uh Rec recollection
 
04:43:44.390 --> 04:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
of thank you further
 
04:43:46.430 --> 04:43:46.440 align:start position:0%

representative U twice you mentioned the
 
04:43:52.030 --> 04:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
1% that's currently in the law what
 
04:43:56.190 --> 04:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
figure were you uh referring
 
04:43:58.910 --> 04:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
to the I think I think it's
 
04:44:01.628 --> 04:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
1.75% is crossed
 
04:44:04.470 --> 04:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
out the the current LA understood you
 
04:44:07.070 --> 04:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
twice I heard you say 1% though so I was

I've been involved with the first

I've been involved with the first
responder

Triad uh with the fire um mostly with
 
04:45:21.070 --> 04:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
the ambulance working with fire and the
 
04:45:23.788 --> 04:45:23.798 align:start position:0%
town and the
 
04:45:26.030 --> 04:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
police so what I'm going to share with
 
04:45:27.830 --> 04:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
you today
 
04:45:31.270 --> 04:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
is since I left in
 
04:45:34.868 --> 04:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
2011 two people have been charged and
 
04:45:37.788 --> 04:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
convicted with felonies of
 
04:45:42.070 --> 04:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
embezzlement one person working with him
 
04:45:44.590 --> 04:45:44.600 align:start position:0%
as he was an instructor this is all
 
04:45:48.708 --> 04:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:53.190 --> 04:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
Connecticut as a EMT instructor he
 
04:45:56.230 --> 04:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
became the town Plymouth Connecticut
 
04:46:01.948 --> 04:46:01.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:05.270 --> 04:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
$800,000 in three years
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
yes it was
 
04:46:10.510 --> 04:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
caught the thing and once again the
 
04:46:13.070 --> 04:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
second gentleman was with the Fire
 
04:46:16.230 --> 04:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
Department volunteer fire of the town he
 
04:46:18.310 --> 04:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
only embezzled
 
04:46:22.670 --> 04:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:25.910 --> 04:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
also as we know I'm
 
04:46:29.948 --> 04:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
assuming things happened
 
04:46:33.350 --> 04:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
that we don't know why without a
 
04:46:33.360 --> 04:46:34.910 align:start position:0%
that we don't know why without a
forensic

04:46:34.910 --> 04:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
forensic
 
04:46:39.390 --> 04:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
it we would not find out why we have
 
04:46:41.310 --> 04:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
audits if the
 
04:46:44.750 --> 04:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
delegation wishes to call one and they
 
04:46:47.590 --> 04:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
did call one and it was a big uproar
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
personalities politics everything got
 
04:46:53.270 --> 04:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
involved by putting in statute
 
04:46:57.670 --> 04:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
eliminates all of that it's there it's
 
04:46:59.670 --> 04:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
an arbitary year they
 
04:47:02.190 --> 04:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
pick and going
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
forward the delegation still can call an
 
04:47:08.430 --> 04:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
audit if it needs it to be within the 5
 
04:47:11.190 --> 04:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
years something else happens but I've
 
04:47:14.270 --> 04:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
seen the politics I've seen the personal
 
04:47:17.990 --> 04:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
um attacks from both sides on calling it
 
04:47:20.830 --> 04:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
audit you bring in people you elected or
 
04:47:22.190 --> 04:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
appointed to
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
it where and basically that's the whole
 
04:47:29.270 --> 04:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
jits from life experience and once again
 
04:47:32.788 --> 04:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
the gun stock area you probably
 
04:47:35.548 --> 04:47:35.558 align:start position:0%
heard the
 
04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
expenditures are equivalent or real
 
04:47:41.628 --> 04:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
close to the whole County's expenditure
 
04:47:44.150 --> 04:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's not a little little bit of money
 
04:47:46.590 --> 04:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
that's handled right now there's no
 
04:47:46.600 --> 04:47:49.270 align:start position:0%
that's handled right now there's no
Treasurer

04:47:49.270 --> 04:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
Treasurer
 
04:47:51.390 --> 04:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not even going to say who
 
04:47:54.150 --> 04:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
does the books I'm not sure my point is
 
04:47:55.910 --> 04:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
my life
 
04:47:57.708 --> 04:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
experience we don't think it's going to
 
04:47:59.510 --> 04:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
happen New Hampshire I didn't think it
 
04:48:01.030 --> 04:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
was going to happen in my small town of
 
04:48:04.788 --> 04:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
Plymouth by people I actually knew
 
04:48:06.670 --> 04:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
why do you why do we need to put it on
 
04:48:09.910 --> 04:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
the delegation to go through this whole
 
04:48:11.990 --> 04:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
political um
 
04:48:14.948 --> 04:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
charade with the public and
 
04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
everything if there is another audit
 
04:48:20.750 --> 04:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
someone thinks needed once again to
 
04:48:23.830 --> 04:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
summarize in statute it will be there it
 
04:48:26.670 --> 04:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be five years that's
 
04:48:29.670 --> 04:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
could be amended in my part just so the
 
04:48:32.830 --> 04:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
people who are handling the money knows
 
04:48:35.548 --> 04:48:35.558 align:start position:0%
that somewhere there's a mechanism
 
04:48:38.788 --> 04:48:38.798 align:start position:0%
that's going to pull up a a year within
 
04:48:40.708 --> 04:48:40.718 align:start position:0%
those five years and take a look at the
 
04:48:43.270 --> 04:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
books um that's
 
04:48:45.750 --> 04:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
about my end of it and I'm willing to
 
04:48:47.708 --> 04:48:47.718 align:start position:0%
take questions thank you thank you for
 
04:48:50.350 --> 04:48:50.360 align:start position:0%
your testimony questions representative
 
04:48:52.470 --> 04:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:48:54.590 --> 04:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question my question is
 
04:48:57.470 --> 04:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
with regards to this um required
 
04:49:00.750 --> 04:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
mandated forensic audit are you aware of
 
04:49:03.430 --> 04:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
any other areas of our New Hampshire
 
04:49:03.440 --> 04:49:04.470 align:start position:0%
any other areas of our New Hampshire
statute

04:49:04.470 --> 04:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:49:08.548 --> 04:49:08.558 align:start position:0%
that requires a similar forensic audit
 
04:49:11.310 --> 04:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
and the second qu part of that is just
 
04:49:14.390 --> 04:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
confirm that the commission Gunstock
 
04:49:16.310 --> 04:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
commission is going to pay for this
 
04:49:19.430 --> 04:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
audit If This Were to become
 
04:49:22.948 --> 04:49:22.958 align:start position:0%
law if I understand it right um I don't
 
04:49:25.070 --> 04:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
have the RSA in front of me but the
 
04:49:25.080 --> 04:49:26.788 align:start position:0%
have the RSA in front of me but the
county

04:49:26.788 --> 04:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
county
 
04:49:31.270 --> 04:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
delegation has a statute to call for
 
04:49:34.708 --> 04:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
Audits and the second part I believe is
 
04:49:41.150 --> 04:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
I think the audit is by excuse
 
04:49:44.670 --> 04:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
me it's going to be by Statute and the
 
04:49:47.390 --> 04:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
auditor would pick a year
 
04:49:52.548 --> 04:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:56.350 --> 04:49:56.360 align:start position:0%
chosen do you have a follow-up
 
04:49:58.070 --> 04:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative thank thank you
 
04:50:00.510 --> 04:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
representative um I'll restate my
 
04:50:02.990 --> 04:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
question and I'll just I'll just keep it
 
04:50:04.510 --> 04:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
to one
 
04:50:08.548 --> 04:50:08.558 align:start position:0%
so my I'm curious to to to know and to
 
04:50:11.310 --> 04:50:11.320 align:start position:0%
understand do you know if there's any
 
04:50:11.320 --> 04:50:15.310 align:start position:0%
understand do you know if there's any
other

04:50:15.310 --> 04:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:17.948 --> 04:50:17.958 align:start position:0%
areas I'll I'll withdraw my
 
04:50:20.190 --> 04:50:20.200 align:start position:0%
question may
 
04:50:23.310 --> 04:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
I representative major thank you Mr
 
04:50:24.430 --> 04:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you taking my
 
04:50:26.750 --> 04:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
question and and just so I'm clear and
 
04:50:28.030 --> 04:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
want to see if you understand it the
 
04:50:30.628 --> 04:50:30.638 align:start position:0%
same way the audit can go back to
 
04:50:34.430 --> 04:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
2016 correct because it says in order to
 
04:50:37.310 --> 04:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
be clear that it shall start in the year
 
04:50:41.310 --> 04:50:41.320 align:start position:0%
2021 and include any 5-year period
 
04:50:43.350 --> 04:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
previously and therefore if I read the
 
04:50:45.430 --> 04:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
plain language your friend a AIT of a
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
random year in the preceding five years
 
04:50:50.230 --> 04:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
and the first year is 2021 that it can
 
04:50:55.868 --> 04:50:55.878 align:start position:0%
go back to 2016 or what's 21 minus
 
04:50:58.650 --> 04:50:58.660 align:start position:0%
5 hold on wait a minute carry the
 
04:50:58.660 --> 04:51:01.270 align:start position:0%
5 hold on wait a minute carry the
[Laughter]

04:51:01.270 --> 04:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:51:06.390 --> 04:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
and yes to your question yes it it could
 
04:51:13.270 --> 04:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
go back five years but that's how it's
 
04:51:16.030 --> 04:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
introduced I I leave it up it's in your
 
04:51:19.110 --> 04:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
hands if it needs to be changed to
 
04:51:24.190 --> 04:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
eliminate the pass and start fresh if if
 
04:51:28.470 --> 04:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
that's how the committee wishes to go um
 
04:51:31.830 --> 04:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
I don't see anything wrong but yes one
 
04:51:33.548 --> 04:51:33.558 align:start position:0%
year within those six yes it could go
 
04:51:35.708 --> 04:51:35.718 align:start position:0%
back back to something that has been
 
04:51:35.718 --> 04:51:37.190 align:start position:0%
back back to something that has been
addressed

04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
04:51:40.470 --> 04:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
already and this committee does have the
 
04:51:43.150 --> 04:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
experience to decide which way it should
 
04:51:45.548 --> 04:51:45.558 align:start position:0%
go when it should
 
04:51:48.270 --> 04:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
start further
 
04:51:50.470 --> 04:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
04:51:52.948 --> 04:51:52.958 align:start position:0%

04:52:02.638 --> 04:52:06.150 align:start position:0%
 
day

04:52:06.150 --> 04:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:09.070 --> 04:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
um if he wants
 
04:52:12.110 --> 04:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
to what was his
 
04:52:17.110 --> 04:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
name um he may speak before you but in
 
04:52:18.948 --> 04:52:18.958 align:start position:0%

04:52:21.708 --> 04:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
up will be the honorable Mike Sylvia and
 
04:52:24.510 --> 04:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
then I'll have him speak yes and he can
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:32.638 --> 04:52:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:52:41.990 --> 04:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:44.270 --> 04:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my name is Mike
 
04:52:46.470 --> 04:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
Sylvia I'm from the town of Belmont
 
04:52:49.190 --> 04:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
repres representing myself I am former
 
04:52:52.708 --> 04:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
representative for five terms and former
 
04:52:57.110 --> 04:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:59.830 --> 04:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
delegation we're here today
 
04:53:01.830 --> 04:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
because there was a problem a couple
 
04:53:05.628 --> 04:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
years ago in the summer of 22 that's
 
04:53:07.270 --> 04:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
when things came to a
 
04:53:09.868 --> 04:53:09.878 align:start position:0%
boil and one of the gentlemen that's
 
04:53:11.150 --> 04:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
going to speak to you next and you can
 
04:53:13.230 --> 04:53:13.240 align:start position:0%
have some questions for
 
04:53:17.590 --> 04:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
him prior contrary to his
 
04:53:21.590 --> 04:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
contract walked out of his job as the
 
04:53:25.230 --> 04:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
CEO president of Gunstock Mountain
 
04:53:28.230 --> 04:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
resort with him
 
04:53:30.670 --> 04:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
coincidentally three key members of
 
04:53:32.548 --> 04:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
management walked out
 
04:53:32.558 --> 04:53:35.868 align:start position:0%
management walked out
also

04:53:35.868 --> 04:53:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:37.868 --> 04:53:37.878 align:start position:0%
in my
 
04:53:42.030 --> 04:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
mind this comes to the level of
 
04:53:45.430 --> 04:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
sabotage Gunstock was shut down because
 
04:53:48.070 --> 04:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
of the walk out of these people and it
 
04:53:49.948 --> 04:53:49.958 align:start position:0%
threw everybody into a
 
04:53:49.958 --> 04:53:51.948 align:start position:0%
threw everybody into a
crisis

04:53:51.948 --> 04:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
and they all had to do something we had
 
04:53:58.230 --> 04:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:00.948 --> 04:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
open we know the way that things went
 
04:54:05.030 --> 04:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
because shortly after this walk out
 
04:54:07.628 --> 04:54:07.638 align:start position:0%
the man in the corner office said hey
 
04:54:09.070 --> 04:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
those folks can have a job with the
 
04:54:11.070 --> 04:54:11.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we'll put them in
 
04:54:12.670 --> 04:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
parks and recreations whatever we got to
 
04:54:15.948 --> 04:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
do those good people deserve
 
04:54:18.350 --> 04:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
jobs what he should have been doing is
 
04:54:20.430 --> 04:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
talking to his attorney
 
04:54:22.910 --> 04:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
general that didn't
 
04:54:25.430 --> 04:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
happen that's why we're here and that's
 
04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
why we need forensic
 
04:54:31.070 --> 04:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
orders because as you know now
 
04:54:34.270 --> 04:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
$1,500 was given to the man in the
 
04:54:34.280 --> 04:54:35.350 align:start position:0%
$1,500 was given to the man in the
corner

04:54:35.350 --> 04:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
corner
 
04:54:38.350 --> 04:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
office in two separate checks over two
 
04:54:41.110 --> 04:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
different years and this was a mistake
 
04:54:45.590 --> 04:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
by the CEO because prior
 
04:54:50.150 --> 04:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
to him writing directly a check to the
 
04:54:51.708 --> 04:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
campaign of
 
04:54:55.230 --> 04:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
a gubernatorial
 
04:54:57.590 --> 04:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
candidate they used a different system
 
04:55:00.270 --> 04:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
much more popular system it's called
 
04:55:01.948 --> 04:55:01.958 align:start position:0%
lobbying and
 
04:55:05.830 --> 04:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
lobbyist and you usually in the past
 
04:55:08.390 --> 04:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
money was filtered through ski New
 
04:55:08.400 --> 04:55:09.788 align:start position:0%
money was filtered through ski New
Hampshire

04:55:09.788 --> 04:55:09.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:55:12.470 --> 04:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps the lobbyist who was here today
 
04:55:15.310 --> 04:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
sitting next to the former CEO the soon
 
04:55:17.390 --> 04:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
to be former CEO thank God he's
 
04:55:21.868 --> 04:55:21.878 align:start position:0%
retiring um those donations were made to
 
04:55:25.430 --> 04:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
the uh lobbying firm that represents the
 
04:55:28.590 --> 04:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
ski industry for New Hampshire I'm sure
 
04:55:31.708 --> 04:55:31.718 align:start position:0%
they don't say where those monies are
 
04:55:34.708 --> 04:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
going to go anything like that
 
04:55:37.030 --> 04:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're here I said I'd take
 
04:55:39.190 --> 04:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
two minutes I'm probably about there so
 
04:55:41.070 --> 04:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
if you have questions I'd be happy to
 
04:55:45.510 --> 04:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:45.520 --> 04:55:47.948 align:start position:0%
 
Gallagher

04:55:47.948 --> 04:55:47.958 align:start position:0%
Gallagher
 
04:55:47.958 --> 04:55:49.788 align:start position:0%
Gallagher
um

04:55:49.788 --> 04:55:49.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:52.510 --> 04:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
so in
 
04:55:56.708 --> 04:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
2022 um the whole Gunstock
 
04:55:59.310 --> 04:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
issue uh
 
04:56:03.788 --> 04:56:03.798 align:start position:0%
was a pretty major issue in the
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
legislative elections that year would do
 
04:56:09.270 --> 04:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
you think it would be fair to interpret
 
04:56:13.990 --> 04:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
the results of the 2022 election as a
 
04:56:16.590 --> 04:56:16.600 align:start position:0%
referendum of Voters opinions on the
 
04:56:16.600 --> 04:56:17.230 align:start position:0%
referendum of Voters opinions on the
Gunstock

04:56:17.230 --> 04:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
Gunstock
 
04:56:17.240 --> 04:56:18.590 align:start position:0%
Gunstock
[Music]

04:56:18.590 --> 04:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:56:18.600 --> 04:56:20.230 align:start position:0%
[Music]
matter

04:56:20.230 --> 04:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
matter
 
04:56:22.270 --> 04:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
well I don't know how much you know
 
04:56:24.510 --> 04:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
about the uh media industry and who
 
04:56:27.390 --> 04:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
knows in the forensic audit the new Hamp
 
04:56:30.510 --> 04:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
the Laconia daily Sun's um payments for
 
04:56:34.150 --> 04:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
advertising might be looked at um um but
 
04:56:37.310 --> 04:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
there was a uh a campaign which had
 
04:56:40.110 --> 04:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
started previously in previous October
 
04:56:42.868 --> 04:56:42.878 align:start position:0%
November with citizens for gun Gunstock
 
04:56:46.948 --> 04:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
which then morphed into citizens for
 
04:56:50.510 --> 04:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
bellnap um there was a big lobbying U
 
04:56:53.310 --> 04:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
push on a lot of money spent and uh
 
04:56:54.910 --> 04:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
probably in the order of
 
04:56:59.190 --> 04:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
$50,000 to select certain candidates to
 
04:57:01.868 --> 04:57:01.878 align:start position:0%
win and replace and naturally I was top
 
04:57:04.270 --> 04:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
Target because certain people don't like
 
04:57:06.670 --> 04:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
me because I like the
 
04:57:09.230 --> 04:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
truth for
 
04:57:12.788 --> 04:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
questions CA I have one rep uh honorable
 
04:57:12.798 --> 04:57:13.628 align:start position:0%
questions CA I have one rep uh honorable
Mr

04:57:13.628 --> 04:57:13.638 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
04:57:16.548 --> 04:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
honorable um you mentioned
 
04:57:19.868 --> 04:57:19.878 align:start position:0%
2022 that Gunstock was shut down did the
 
04:57:22.990 --> 04:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
did Gunstock end up having a uh a losing
 
04:57:26.548 --> 04:57:26.558 align:start position:0%
money year did they or if you're not if
 
04:57:28.430 --> 04:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
you can't answer it that no I I believe
 
04:57:31.150 --> 04:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
they made money actually um the there
 
04:57:33.350 --> 04:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
was they the the shutdown happened just
 
04:57:34.788 --> 04:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
before soulfest which they were trying
 
04:57:37.350 --> 04:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
to get rid of in in the first place and
 
04:57:39.868 --> 04:57:39.878 align:start position:0%
of course it's a Summer Event so uh they
 
04:57:42.708 --> 04:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
they managed to um get rid of The
 
04:57:44.868 --> 04:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
Unwanted Gunstock Commissioners replace
 
04:57:48.548 --> 04:57:48.558 align:start position:0%
them with a favorable U body and uh
 
04:57:52.150 --> 04:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
proceeded on and uh did a fine time as
 
04:57:54.628 --> 04:57:54.638 align:start position:0%
far as the uh profitability of gun stock
 
04:57:59.070 --> 04:57:59.080 align:start position:0%
let's always remember that back in 2000
 
04:58:01.070 --> 04:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh they essentially went underwater and
 
04:58:03.390 --> 04:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
dumped $6 million of debt on to the
 
04:58:03.400 --> 04:58:04.310 align:start position:0%
dumped $6 million of debt on to the
county

04:58:04.310 --> 04:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
county
 
04:58:07.548 --> 04:58:07.558 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so that was a big hit and
 
04:58:10.628 --> 04:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
hardly a profit Center thank you very
 
04:58:12.110 --> 04:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
much further
 
04:58:14.270 --> 04:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
questions see you then thank you very
 
04:58:15.590 --> 04:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
04:58:26.350 --> 04:58:26.360 align:start position:0%

Gunstock area commission the five member

04:58:50.628 --> 04:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
Resort the commission stands in
 
04:58:53.190 --> 04:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
unanimous opposition to the passage of
 
04:58:57.670 --> 04:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1414 dfn in urges this
 
04:59:00.030 --> 04:59:00.040 align:start position:0%
committee to issue a recommendation of
 
04:59:02.030 --> 04:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to
 
04:59:02.040 --> 04:59:03.670 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to
legislate

04:59:03.670 --> 04:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
04:59:06.390 --> 04:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
in a typical situation the basis for
 
04:59:08.948 --> 04:59:08.958 align:start position:0%
most legislation is that it should be
 
04:59:11.590 --> 04:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
formed with the intention of fixing a
 
04:59:14.430 --> 04:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
problem while responding to the needs
 
04:59:17.070 --> 04:59:17.080 align:start position:0%
and wishes of a majority of the public
 
04:59:17.080 --> 04:59:18.230 align:start position:0%
and wishes of a majority of the public
being

04:59:18.230 --> 04:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:59:21.030 --> 04:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
represented the proposed bill before you
 
04:59:24.548 --> 04:59:24.558 align:start position:0%
does neither it seeks to fix a problem
 
04:59:27.910 --> 04:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
that does not exist and is in no way
 
04:59:30.910 --> 04:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
serving any measurable numbers of the
 
04:59:34.390 --> 04:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
belnap county citizens this B Bill
 
04:59:36.868 --> 04:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
contains three components that seeks to
 
04:59:39.750 --> 04:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
modify the current law that directs the
 
04:59:41.670 --> 04:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
operation and maintenance of the gun
 
04:59:45.830 --> 04:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
stock area this was last revised in 2020
 
04:59:48.390 --> 04:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
and became effective September of that
 
04:59:52.310 --> 04:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
year in the form of House Bill
 
04:59:55.070 --> 04:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
1442 since that time it has proven
 
04:59:57.750 --> 04:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
itself to be a sound piece of
 
05:00:00.510 --> 05:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
legislation that maintains a just
 
05:00:03.110 --> 05:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
balance between allowing the area to to
 
05:00:07.190 --> 05:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
build and maintain self Su
 
05:00:10.030 --> 05:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
sustainability while providing a payback
 
05:00:11.310 --> 05:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
to belnap
 
05:00:15.310 --> 05:00:15.320 align:start position:0%
county in that 2020 legislation it
 
05:00:16.910 --> 05:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
provided that
 
05:00:20.350 --> 05:00:20.360 align:start position:0%
1.75% of yearly gross operating income
 
05:00:22.470 --> 05:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
shall be turned over to the bellnap
 
05:00:26.270 --> 05:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
County Treasurer within 45 days of the
 
05:00:30.430 --> 05:00:30.440 align:start position:0%
receipt and approval of the annual
 
05:00:34.030 --> 05:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
audit in the most recent fiscal cycle
 
05:00:36.788 --> 05:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
this amounted to just over
 
05:00:39.990 --> 05:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
$352,000 delivered to belnap County
 
05:00:42.708 --> 05:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
prior to September 2020 rather than
 
05:00:45.590 --> 05:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
delivering money to count to the county
 
05:00:47.990 --> 05:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
Gunstock was borrowing money
 
05:00:50.670 --> 05:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
underwritten by belnap County to
 
05:00:53.948 --> 05:00:53.958 align:start position:0%
facilitate the revenue anticipation note
 
05:00:57.548 --> 05:00:57.558 align:start position:0%
or ran as we was referred to earlier it
 
05:00:59.788 --> 05:00:59.798 align:start position:0%
is the opinion of the Gunstock area
 
05:01:02.150 --> 05:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
commission that the current percentage
 
05:01:05.110 --> 05:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
amounts strikes a fair balance between
 
05:01:07.910 --> 05:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
providing a monetary benefit to the
 
05:01:10.990 --> 05:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
citizens and taxpayers of belnap County
 
05:01:13.750 --> 05:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
while allowing the gun stock area to
 
05:01:16.910 --> 05:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
cover all expenses and plan for the
 
05:01:20.190 --> 05:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
ongoing current and future needs while
 
05:01:23.830 --> 05:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
remaining on the chared cost of
 
05:01:25.990 --> 05:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency the first component of
 
05:01:28.270 --> 05:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation before you
 
05:01:31.830 --> 05:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
seeks to change the percent to 3% nearly
 
05:01:35.030 --> 05:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
double to make a change at this time
 
05:01:37.628 --> 05:01:37.638 align:start position:0%
when many of the past Financial stresses
 
05:01:40.910 --> 05:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
and difficulties have been identified
 
05:01:44.350 --> 05:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
and corrected could begin to remove
 
05:01:46.750 --> 05:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
important operational and future
 
05:01:49.470 --> 05:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
investment capital and could start a
 
05:01:52.628 --> 05:01:52.638 align:start position:0%
process to chip away and put at risk
 
05:01:55.788 --> 05:01:55.798 align:start position:0%
what has been achieved since
 
05:01:58.868 --> 05:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
2020 gun Stock's Financial benefit to
 
05:02:01.510 --> 05:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
belnap county is very significant in the
 
05:02:04.750 --> 05:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
areas such as local Employment Services
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
provided by local businesses and
 
05:02:09.110 --> 05:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
contractors and of course the
 
05:02:12.548 --> 05:02:12.558 align:start position:0%
substantial tourism draw across the
 
05:02:15.670 --> 05:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
seasons this requires continued
 
05:02:19.350 --> 05:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
investment maintenance and an ability to
 
05:02:22.230 --> 05:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
attract staff in a competitive labor
 
05:02:25.150 --> 05:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
market to tamper with this valuable
 
05:02:27.708 --> 05:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
County asset could result in
 
05:02:30.150 --> 05:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
ramifications far greater than the
 
05:02:32.270 --> 05:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
actual dollars that might show on the
 
05:02:34.070 --> 05:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
treasur is ledger
 
05:02:37.390 --> 05:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
book the second component of this bill
 
05:02:39.910 --> 05:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
seeks to require the video recording of
 
05:02:42.788 --> 05:02:42.798 align:start position:0%
all Gunstock area meetings the
 
05:02:45.230 --> 05:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
commission is already governed by the
 
05:02:47.150 --> 05:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
relevant laws of the State of New
 
05:02:49.310 --> 05:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as they pertain to public
 
05:02:52.310 --> 05:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
bodies all of its business is conducted
 
05:02:54.310 --> 05:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
in full compliance with the right to
 
05:02:56.670 --> 05:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
know law RSA
 
05:03:00.190 --> 05:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
91a currently through policy our
 
05:03:03.310 --> 05:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
meetings are in fact being recorded and
 
05:03:05.628 --> 05:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
made available to the public on a
 
05:03:08.670 --> 05:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
voluntary basis to put such a
 
05:03:11.230 --> 05:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
requirement into law that goes above and
 
05:03:13.910 --> 05:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
beyond that which is required of all
 
05:03:16.788 --> 05:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
other public bodies in the state of New
 
05:03:19.390 --> 05:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not seem to be a
 
05:03:22.948 --> 05:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
necessary step the third component of
 
05:03:25.868 --> 05:03:25.878 align:start position:0%
this bill which I'd like to speak to is
 
05:03:28.708 --> 05:03:28.718 align:start position:0%
the mandated uh
 
05:03:32.070 --> 05:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
Financial uh forensic audit within the
 
05:03:32.080 --> 05:03:33.270 align:start position:0%
Financial uh forensic audit within the
5year

05:03:33.270 --> 05:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
5year
 
05:03:36.190 --> 05:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
periods this aspect of the bill before
 
05:03:37.590 --> 05:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
you for
 
05:03:40.708 --> 05:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
consideration is redundant when one
 
05:03:43.270 --> 05:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
reads and applies the words of the
 
05:03:46.190 --> 05:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
existing governing law as modified back
 
05:03:46.200 --> 05:03:46.948 align:start position:0%
existing governing law as modified back
in

05:03:46.948 --> 05:03:46.958 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:03:51.150 --> 05:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
2022 quote all Financial transactions of
 
05:03:54.390 --> 05:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
the commission shall be audited annually
 
05:03:58.990 --> 05:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
and at such other times and in such
 
05:04:01.990 --> 05:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
manner as the County Convention May
 
05:04:02.000 --> 05:04:03.628 align:start position:0%
manner as the County Convention May
determine

05:04:03.628 --> 05:04:03.638 align:start position:0%
determine
 
05:04:05.990 --> 05:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
there is simply no need for the mandated
 
05:04:09.948 --> 05:04:09.958 align:start position:0%
forensic audit all records and financial
 
05:04:12.750 --> 05:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
information is available under current
 
05:04:17.350 --> 05:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
91a law if such evidence is discovered
 
05:04:19.470 --> 05:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
that could call for further scrutiny
 
05:04:22.590 --> 05:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
provided by an audit of this nature the
 
05:04:25.350 --> 05:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
County Convention can examine it and
 
05:04:28.510 --> 05:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
call for one if they should determine to
 
05:04:32.910 --> 05:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
do so I would further add uh in to
 
05:04:35.430 --> 05:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
answer to in answer to a question
 
05:04:38.470 --> 05:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
earlier approximately 15 years ago the
 
05:04:40.510 --> 05:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
County Administrator was caught in
 
05:04:43.510 --> 05:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
bezeling money from belnap County I
 
05:04:45.830 --> 05:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
attended the trial and watched her
 
05:04:49.190 --> 05:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
walked away in handcuffs she was
 
05:04:52.310 --> 05:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
convicted I'm not aware and I could be
 
05:04:55.270 --> 05:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
mistaken but I don't believe that belnap
 
05:04:58.190 --> 05:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
County subjects itself to a forensic
 
05:05:02.190 --> 05:05:02.200 align:start position:0%
audit now you would think that if there
 
05:05:04.868 --> 05:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
ever was a situation that perhaps might
 
05:05:07.150 --> 05:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
call for it there was it and I'll
 
05:05:08.990 --> 05:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
further add that I'm a member of the
 
05:05:10.990 --> 05:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
commission a five member commission that
 
05:05:13.548 --> 05:05:13.558 align:start position:0%
is appointed by the county
 
05:05:17.070 --> 05:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
delegation now at what point are we
 
05:05:19.390 --> 05:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
going to say that we can't trust any
 
05:05:21.990 --> 05:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
member of government any person in a
 
05:05:24.788 --> 05:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
public body I took an oath as did my
 
05:05:27.548 --> 05:05:27.558 align:start position:0%
fellow Commissioners and when we when
 
05:05:30.270 --> 05:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
the current commission began operation
 
05:05:32.548 --> 05:05:32.558 align:start position:0%
we looked deeply we took into
 
05:05:35.510 --> 05:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
consideration the concerns of the other
 
05:05:38.628 --> 05:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
reps that spoke here prior and we did a
 
05:05:42.190 --> 05:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
deep dive we actually conducted a if you
 
05:05:45.470 --> 05:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
will forensic audit of our own of this
 
05:05:49.470 --> 05:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
2021 um budget and we spent many hours
 
05:05:52.070 --> 05:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
going through check by check in and went
 
05:05:54.910 --> 05:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
down every issue that representative
 
05:05:58.548 --> 05:05:58.558 align:start position:0%
ktoa had brought to the audit firm in
 
05:06:01.708 --> 05:06:01.718 align:start position:0%
the course of their traditional audit
 
05:06:01.718 --> 05:06:03.590 align:start position:0%
the course of their traditional audit
now

05:06:03.590 --> 05:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:06:07.548 --> 05:06:07.558 align:start position:0%
I I guess um perhaps if if we're not
 
05:06:09.548 --> 05:06:09.558 align:start position:0%
going to trust the Gunstar commission
 
05:06:12.830 --> 05:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
who are duly appointed where members of
 
05:06:14.628 --> 05:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
the government here in the state of New
 
05:06:17.270 --> 05:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if we can't trust us and we
 
05:06:19.430 --> 05:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
can't trust the county delegation that
 
05:06:22.230 --> 05:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
oversees us and have to put into law
 
05:06:24.788 --> 05:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
some additional
 
05:06:27.670 --> 05:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
requirements where do we stop do we stop
 
05:06:29.868 --> 05:06:29.878 align:start position:0%
there do we go to the general court the
 
05:06:34.830 --> 05:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
Senate where does it end um the this
 
05:06:37.868 --> 05:06:37.878 align:start position:0%
entire bill just again I'll close and
 
05:06:41.990 --> 05:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
say that it it seeks to fix a problem
 
05:06:46.990 --> 05:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
that does not exist and it seeks to add
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
extraordinary costs above and beyond
 
05:06:51.788 --> 05:06:51.798 align:start position:0%
what we've already been doing and by the
 
05:06:54.868 --> 05:06:54.878 align:start position:0%
way it rained for the entire week of
 
05:06:57.670 --> 05:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
Christmas we lost the Saturday of Martin
 
05:07:01.270 --> 05:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
Luther King weekend uh Revenue thus far
 
05:07:03.310 --> 05:07:03.320 align:start position:0%
this year is almost a million dollars
 
05:07:05.990 --> 05:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
behind last year we are very weather
 
05:07:08.788 --> 05:07:08.798 align:start position:0%
driven and we can go from one year to
 
05:07:11.390 --> 05:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
the next from having a very successful
 
05:07:14.948 --> 05:07:14.958 align:start position:0%
year to having a very difficult year and
 
05:07:18.070 --> 05:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
the monies that we may save in our
 
05:07:20.868 --> 05:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
profits will help to carry us through so
 
05:07:23.030 --> 05:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
that we don't have to come back to
 
05:07:26.470 --> 05:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
bellnap County taxpayers ever again and
 
05:07:28.990 --> 05:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
ask them to foot the bill it's a much
 
05:07:32.070 --> 05:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
better um experience to go there once a
 
05:07:35.150 --> 05:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
year and hand over a nice check but we
 
05:07:37.350 --> 05:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
don't want to jeopardize all that has
 
05:07:40.628 --> 05:07:40.638 align:start position:0%
been achieved in the last four years and
 
05:07:42.990 --> 05:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your time and I'm happy

questions seeing none thank you very
 
05:07:52.390 --> 05:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
much we'll call we've got two more pink

cards up here I'll say the names just in
 
05:07:57.310 --> 05:07:57.320 align:start position:0%
case anybody else was thinking of
 
05:07:59.590 --> 05:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
speaking uh Tom day you're up next and
 
05:08:24.110 --> 05:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:25.708 --> 05:08:25.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for listening
 
05:08:28.230 --> 05:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
to my testimony my name is Tom day I'm
 
05:08:29.830 --> 05:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
the president and general manager of
 
05:08:32.830 --> 05:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
Gunstock Mountain Resort um I've been in
 
05:08:34.708 --> 05:08:34.718 align:start position:0%
the ski industry for 40 years and I've
 
05:08:36.990 --> 05:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
been at Gunstock for four the ski
 
05:08:38.430 --> 05:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
business is totally weather related and
 
05:08:40.548 --> 05:08:40.558 align:start position:0%
the operating costs are based on that
 
05:08:42.310 --> 05:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
we're constantly adjusting operating
 
05:08:44.628 --> 05:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
plans to to basically deal with the
 
05:08:47.230 --> 05:08:47.240 align:start position:0%
weather problems that we have we're in
 
05:08:49.990 --> 05:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
business for 13 weeks really we have 13
 
05:08:53.270 --> 05:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
weeks to make money and as uh uh
 
05:08:55.270 --> 05:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner Lambert mentioned during
 
05:08:59.310 --> 05:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
this past um Christmas week we it rained
 
05:09:02.350 --> 05:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
pretty much every day and uh we did end
 
05:09:03.750 --> 05:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
up without with the Martin Luther King
 
05:09:05.350 --> 05:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
hit we ended up a million dollars behind
 
05:09:07.868 --> 05:09:07.878 align:start position:0%
what our normal budgeted revenues were
 
05:09:10.628 --> 05:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
so it's it's just it's it's and that's
 
05:09:12.948 --> 05:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
unrecoverable you can't add you can't
 
05:09:15.470 --> 05:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
add 10 more days to a month you can't
 
05:09:17.590 --> 05:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
add another holiday you're just you're
 
05:09:20.030 --> 05:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
when it's gone by it's gone
 
05:09:22.628 --> 05:09:22.638 align:start position:0%
by the Gunstock commission as we've
 
05:09:24.708 --> 05:09:24.718 align:start position:0%
talked about quite a bit so I won't go
 
05:09:27.788 --> 05:09:27.798 align:start position:0%
go too much into it pays 1.7 the Gunstar
 
05:09:30.910 --> 05:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
pays 1.75 of gross revenue to the
 
05:09:33.030 --> 05:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
Commission in the past three years we've
 
05:09:38.030 --> 05:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
paid over $675,000 on that thing to that
 
05:09:41.990 --> 05:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
um the the but the positive the positive
 
05:09:44.470 --> 05:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
impact of Gunstock in the community is
 
05:09:46.910 --> 05:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
is is is important and we've heard a lot
 
05:09:49.910 --> 05:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
about how well G Gunstock does and what
 
05:09:51.390 --> 05:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
it does I think once again it's
 
05:09:53.390 --> 05:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
important to recognize that since 2020
 
05:09:54.750 --> 05:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
we have not borrowed a revenue
 
05:09:57.150 --> 05:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
anticipation note and and that's I took
 
05:09:59.750 --> 05:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
over in 2020 and I couldn't figure out
 
05:10:01.030 --> 05:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
why we needed to borrow a million
 
05:10:03.030 --> 05:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
dollars to keep our business running so
 
05:10:06.470 --> 05:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
in 2019 our Revenue was $12 million and
 
05:10:09.628 --> 05:10:09.638 align:start position:0%
in 2023 our Revenue was $20 million
 
05:10:12.430 --> 05:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
we've spent we've um in four years we've
 
05:10:14.390 --> 05:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
done $12 million worth of improvements
 
05:10:16.788 --> 05:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
to the resort and didn't borrow a dime
 
05:10:19.150 --> 05:10:19.160 align:start position:0%
just last summer alone we did $6 million
 
05:10:22.590 --> 05:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
of of improvements the the thought of
 
05:10:24.948 --> 05:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
even having to go to ask for Revenue
 
05:10:27.788 --> 05:10:27.798 align:start position:0%
anticipation note is is not is alien to
 
05:10:30.708 --> 05:10:30.718 align:start position:0%
me but we can get into that situation if
 
05:10:33.190 --> 05:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
we're if we have a bad window like this
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
but we don't want to have to do that
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
again um the forensic audits you've
 
05:10:39.310 --> 05:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
heard about it um that you've heard
 
05:10:41.510 --> 05:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
about the numbers and the cost of the
 
05:10:44.030 --> 05:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
forensic audit um I'm not that familiar
 
05:10:45.390 --> 05:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
with it I can tell you that I know
 
05:10:47.390 --> 05:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
forensic audits basically look at every
 
05:10:49.708 --> 05:10:49.718 align:start position:0%
check and we' we generate between 3,000
 
05:10:53.510 --> 05:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
and 4,000 checks in a in a year so um
 
05:10:56.830 --> 05:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
that would be a fairly expensive process
 
05:10:58.628 --> 05:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
and and I know there's been a lot of
 
05:11:02.070 --> 05:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
discussion about um about that uh prior
 
05:11:05.110 --> 05:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
to to this hearing today and we are very
 
05:11:06.750 --> 05:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
successful I think something else is
 
05:11:08.670 --> 05:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
important to recognize too is we have
 
05:11:12.910 --> 05:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
$5.2 Million worth of payroll 62% of
 
05:11:15.350 --> 05:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
those people live in bellnap County um
 
05:11:17.910 --> 05:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
we are a main driver for the revenue in
 
05:11:20.110 --> 05:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
in the town and if we don't have a good
 
05:11:22.390 --> 05:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
season um they don't have a good season
 
05:11:24.470 --> 05:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
either and and I've talked to plenty of
 
05:11:26.750 --> 05:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
the local businesses and they're they're
 
05:11:28.350 --> 05:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
suffering just like we're suffering this
 
05:11:31.590 --> 05:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
year so um I'd like to correct a couple
 
05:11:33.830 --> 05:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
of things things too is that the
 
05:11:37.868 --> 05:11:37.878 align:start position:0%
contribution was $1,500 not $5,000 that
 
05:11:41.230 --> 05:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
was that made to to the 2020 and 2022
 
05:11:50.948 --> 05:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:53.990 --> 05:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
see so I I think that's really all that
 
05:11:55.990 --> 05:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
I have to say Doug did mention that
 
05:11:58.110 --> 05:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
there was a there way before my time
 
05:11:59.830 --> 05:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
there was a default on I thought it was
 
05:12:01.548 --> 05:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
in 2010 but apparently it might have
 
05:12:01.558 --> 05:12:02.430 align:start position:0%
in 2010 but apparently it might have
been

05:12:02.430 --> 05:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:12:05.750 --> 05:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
20 2000 um you know there has been no
 
05:12:07.390 --> 05:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
default since we've been involved it's
 
05:12:09.270 --> 05:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
been nothing but an upo trajectory we've
 
05:12:11.390 --> 05:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
really tried to improve the experience
 
05:12:13.910 --> 05:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
of the guests there and try to create a
 
05:12:16.270 --> 05:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
better environment for a gem of an area
 
05:12:18.350 --> 05:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
that is Gunstock Mountain Resort and I'm
 
05:12:20.110 --> 05:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
proud to have been involved in it for
 
05:12:24.310 --> 05:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
the past four years um and um if there's
 
05:12:26.590 --> 05:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
any questions um please feel free to ask
 
05:12:28.670 --> 05:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
me I appreciate your
 
05:12:32.670 --> 05:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
time representative K Hill thank you Mr
 
05:12:34.070 --> 05:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
CH thank you for taking my question and
 
05:12:35.948 --> 05:12:35.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving your testimony here
 
05:12:37.990 --> 05:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
you said you guys are open for 13 weeks
 
05:12:40.230 --> 05:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
but I heard mention of a soulfest um do
 
05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
you do you guys make Revenue in other
 
05:12:45.230 --> 05:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
ways other than the ski season 85% of
 
05:12:47.628 --> 05:12:47.638 align:start position:0%
your Revenue comes in the ski season 15%
 
05:12:49.590 --> 05:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
of your Revenue comes in the summer
 
05:12:53.110 --> 05:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
months quick followup go ahead are you
 
05:12:54.628 --> 05:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
still doing soulfest and things like
 
05:12:57.750 --> 05:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
that like to J no we uh contrary to the
 
05:12:59.430 --> 05:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
way that it was stated prior to
 
05:13:01.548 --> 05:13:01.558 align:start position:0%
testimony with me we are not doing Soul
 
05:13:04.390 --> 05:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
f because soulfest uh did not make money
 
05:13:07.190 --> 05:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
in fact it cost it cost us
 
05:13:09.868 --> 05:13:09.878 align:start position:0%
money and we didn't when I got there I
 
05:13:11.868 --> 05:13:11.878 align:start position:0%
didn't know that because the the year I
 
05:13:14.628 --> 05:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
got there um I co hit so we didn't have
 
05:13:16.230 --> 05:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
it that summer we watched it the
 
05:13:17.470 --> 05:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
following year and realized it did not
 
05:13:18.750 --> 05:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
make us
 
05:13:21.510 --> 05:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
money representative y
 
05:13:24.590 --> 05:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
Kella thank you uh thank you for taking
 
05:13:24.600 --> 05:13:25.390 align:start position:0%
Kella thank you uh thank you for taking
the

05:13:25.390 --> 05:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:13:28.030 --> 05:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
question um it
 
05:13:29.990 --> 05:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
seem from your
 
05:13:34.788 --> 05:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
testimony uh that there was um multiple
 
05:13:37.270 --> 05:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
I think on the order of five to 6,000 or
 
05:13:40.590 --> 05:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars of improvements in the
 
05:13:42.670 --> 05:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
current or the prior
 
05:13:46.390 --> 05:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
year um and additional improvements in
 
05:13:48.990 --> 05:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
the year before um can you speak a
 
05:13:52.430 --> 05:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
little bit to why you believe that
 
05:13:55.830 --> 05:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
$300,000 would of of additional Revenue
 
05:14:00.670 --> 05:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
getting transferred to bellnap would um
 
05:14:04.830 --> 05:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
essentially threaten the existence of of
 
05:14:07.190 --> 05:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
that in relation to these massive
 
05:14:08.948 --> 05:14:08.958 align:start position:0%
improvements that which are you're able
 
05:14:11.788 --> 05:14:11.798 align:start position:0%
to do based on the revenue yeah because
 
05:14:13.628 --> 05:14:13.638 align:start position:0%
we as as you can see from this year our
 
05:14:15.788 --> 05:14:15.798 align:start position:0%
revenues on our constant we've been with
 
05:14:17.190 --> 05:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
this the weather has been with us and
 
05:14:19.590 --> 05:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
constantly it's been well but we're
 
05:14:21.708 --> 05:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
going to be under the weather this year
 
05:14:24.150 --> 05:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
with that stuff so that's something that
 
05:14:26.868 --> 05:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
that we think is going to be could be a
 
05:14:28.230 --> 05:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
problem for us going down the road is it
 
05:14:29.830 --> 05:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
going to be if we do better does it go
 
05:14:33.990 --> 05:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
up another 175 1.75% so we just feel
 
05:14:35.510 --> 05:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
that it's from what we have for
 
05:14:40.270 --> 05:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:43.430 --> 05:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
problem representative Elwood thank you
 
05:14:45.590 --> 05:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for being here
 
05:14:49.190 --> 05:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
today does Gunstock have a long range
 
05:14:54.670 --> 05:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
plan um contingency plan based on bad
 
05:14:58.310 --> 05:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
weather in the future well we do we do
 
05:15:01.948 --> 05:15:01.958 align:start position:0%
have um with cash cash cash positive so
 
05:15:05.150 --> 05:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
we can handle having you know a a Bad
 
05:15:06.990 --> 05:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
season so that we don't have to go back
 
05:15:09.110 --> 05:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
and borrow a revenue anticipation note
 
05:15:11.030 --> 05:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
or we don't have to worry about having
 
05:15:13.230 --> 05:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
to do do anything with the county so we
 
05:15:15.230 --> 05:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
do have we are cash positive that we can
 
05:15:16.750 --> 05:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
handle bad
 
05:15:20.390 --> 05:15:20.400 align:start position:0%

course all right now we have the last
 
05:18:40.830 --> 05:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
pink last speak and I'll be super brief
 
05:18:44.230 --> 05:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
Lang so I'm Senator Tim Lang uh I am I
 
05:18:46.030 --> 05:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
serve Senate District 2 which is the
 
05:18:49.708 --> 05:18:49.718 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region uh North and um I before
 
05:18:51.350 --> 05:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
being a senator I was a three-term state
 
05:18:53.230 --> 05:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
representative on the bellnap county
 
05:18:55.628 --> 05:18:55.638 align:start position:0%
delegation um just to put this in
 
05:18:57.350 --> 05:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
perspective a little bit I I oppose the
 
05:18:59.270 --> 05:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
bill and the reason I oppose the bill is
 
05:19:00.868 --> 05:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
because we've just recently changed this
 
05:19:03.590 --> 05:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
law this law was put into effect in 1959
 
05:19:05.110 --> 05:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
and we changed it two years ago to
 
05:19:07.830 --> 05:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
increase the percentage um it used to be
 
05:19:09.670 --> 05:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
that the County Commissioners gave us I
 
05:19:12.390 --> 05:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
think it was about $175,000 a year the
 
05:19:14.110 --> 05:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
law was changed that number went up as
 
05:19:16.948 --> 05:19:16.958 align:start position:0%
you heard heard lastly was
 
05:19:18.990 --> 05:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
$352,000 the same point when I was on a
 
05:19:21.030 --> 05:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
county delegation we were encouraging
 
05:19:22.708 --> 05:19:22.718 align:start position:0%
the county the Gunstock area
 
05:19:24.590 --> 05:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to start creating cash
 
05:19:27.510 --> 05:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
reserves to weather bad weather no pun
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
intended um but to to deal with
 
05:19:31.830 --> 05:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
shortcomings in Revenue
 
05:19:34.150 --> 05:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
and to deal with not having to request
 
05:19:36.430 --> 05:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
the revenue anticipation note which does
 
05:19:38.708 --> 05:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
put taxpayers on the hook um if they
 
05:19:40.708 --> 05:19:40.718 align:start position:0%
should fail I think Senator you uh
 
05:19:41.948 --> 05:19:41.958 align:start position:0%
representative you had a question about
 
05:19:43.390 --> 05:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
whether the debt was paid off yes the
 
05:19:47.910 --> 05:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
debt was paid off um so uh I oppose it
 
05:19:49.590 --> 05:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
because again we've just recently made a
 
05:19:51.590 --> 05:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
change this law we need to have the law
 
05:19:54.030 --> 05:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
in place for a while to a to give the C
 
05:19:55.868 --> 05:19:55.878 align:start position:0%
the gun stack a Commissioners time to
 
05:19:57.708 --> 05:19:57.718 align:start position:0%
develop the cash reserves and understand
 
05:19:59.150 --> 05:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
we're not it's not going to constantly
 
05:20:01.510 --> 05:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
move in the gold posts on them while do
 
05:20:03.590 --> 05:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
this I think it's also in section two
 
05:20:06.548 --> 05:20:06.558 align:start position:0%
with the 91a addition requirement would
 
05:20:08.430 --> 05:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
is seems outrageous consider we they're
 
05:20:10.470 --> 05:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
already governed by 91a and like every
 
05:20:12.430 --> 05:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
other board in the state and the last
 
05:20:13.910 --> 05:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
part that last piece about the friends
 
05:20:16.110 --> 05:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
of audit the county delegation who
 
05:20:18.830 --> 05:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
maintains the uh the oversight of this
 
05:20:20.390 --> 05:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
already has the right to ask for an

me uh that I uh had a scheduling Kur
 
05:23:10.270 --> 05:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
fuffle where I put the hearing date
 
05:23:13.390 --> 05:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
correct but not the month in my calendar
 
05:23:16.470 --> 05:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
for this hearing and whilst I am clearly
 
05:23:18.628 --> 05:23:18.638 align:start position:0%
here I I called off a work uh
 
05:23:20.910 --> 05:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the person who is the
 
05:23:22.990 --> 05:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
housing law expert of the state who
 
05:23:26.230 --> 05:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
wrote this bill could not come in last
 
05:23:28.270 --> 05:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
minute because he was counting on me to
 
05:23:31.230 --> 05:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
to give him the heads up so um if the
 
05:23:35.548 --> 05:23:35.558 align:start position:0%
the chair is gracious enough to consider
 
05:23:37.750 --> 05:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh having me introduce and continuing so
 
05:23:39.470 --> 05:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
that the expert can speak to you all his
 
05:23:42.350 --> 05:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
name is Elliot Barry um I would be great
 
05:23:43.830 --> 05:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
very grateful but of course it is your
 
05:23:46.590 --> 05:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
discretion and I will happily introduce
 
05:23:50.868 --> 05:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
this so um you know housing is our top
 
05:23:52.548 --> 05:23:52.558 align:start position:0%
crisis in this state New Hampshire
 
05:23:57.150 --> 05:23:57.160 align:start position:0%
Business Review uh just ranked us um the
 
05:23:58.830 --> 05:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
second worst state for Millennials
 
05:24:00.150 --> 05:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
primarily because of the housing
 
05:24:01.948 --> 05:24:01.958 align:start position:0%
situation of course you know the graying
 
05:24:03.390 --> 05:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is something that we
 
05:24:05.990 --> 05:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
have all heard repeatedly but the
 
05:24:07.868 --> 05:24:07.878 align:start position:0%
graying of New Hampshire is one and the
 
05:24:10.030 --> 05:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
same with the housing crisis the reason
 
05:24:12.510 --> 05:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
the only reason really the predominant
 
05:24:14.788 --> 05:24:14.798 align:start position:0%
reason certainly that we can't attract
 
05:24:16.548 --> 05:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
and keep young people is because they
 
05:24:18.230 --> 05:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
can't buy a home here and they can't
 
05:24:21.750 --> 05:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
even find affordable housing um New
 
05:24:23.750 --> 05:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is rated the fourth worst
 
05:24:26.948 --> 05:24:26.958 align:start position:0%
state in the country uh for
 
05:24:30.190 --> 05:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
housing 75% of New Hampshire citizens
 
05:24:33.150 --> 05:24:33.160 align:start position:0%
consider the housing crisis very
 
05:24:35.830 --> 05:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
serious um if you are making so we talk
 
05:24:37.788 --> 05:24:37.798 align:start position:0%
about minimum wage a lot as you know
 
05:24:40.230 --> 05:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
it's 725 in the state forget 725 if
 
05:24:43.788 --> 05:24:43.798 align:start position:0%
you're making double that at $15 an hour
 
05:24:46.910 --> 05:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
it would take you three weeks to pay for
 
05:24:50.030 --> 05:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
an average apartment so the the rule of
 
05:24:51.868 --> 05:24:51.878 align:start position:0%
thumb is it should be about one week
 
05:24:54.390 --> 05:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
about 25 30% of your income should go to
 
05:24:56.868 --> 05:24:56.878 align:start position:0%
housing but it would take you 75% of
 
05:24:59.670 --> 05:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
your income to afford a home now if you
 
05:25:02.110 --> 05:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
consider somebody may be working at
 
05:25:05.830 --> 05:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
minimum wage um it would take them 100%
 
05:25:08.470 --> 05:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
of their income if they are working 62
 
05:25:10.830 --> 05:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
hours a week and they don't pay taxes
 
05:25:13.910 --> 05:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
somehow which of course they would um I
 
05:25:16.030 --> 05:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
didn't care to calculate the taxes on
 
05:25:19.948 --> 05:25:19.958 align:start position:0%
that last year 94 homeless individuals
 
05:25:23.868 --> 05:25:23.878 align:start position:0%
died in this state uh for context the
 
05:25:26.390 --> 05:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
third cause a leading cause of death in
 
05:25:28.868 --> 05:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
this state is car accidents which took
 
05:25:33.270 --> 05:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
127 so not that much more um so it it is
 
05:25:38.510 --> 05:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
a very very serious um crisis and I I
 
05:25:41.390 --> 05:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
really want you all to try to hold on to
 
05:25:42.948 --> 05:25:42.958 align:start position:0%
that as we go through this bill and and
 
05:25:44.948 --> 05:25:44.958 align:start position:0%
the details of the bill so the bill
 
05:25:48.270 --> 05:25:48.280 align:start position:0%
before you is enabling only and the New
 
05:25:50.430 --> 05:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association is in
 
05:25:52.948 --> 05:25:52.958 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill um I understand that
 
05:25:54.788 --> 05:25:54.798 align:start position:0%
that lobbyist is currently in a meeting
 
05:25:57.230 --> 05:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
but intends to come here and testify I
 
05:26:01.150 --> 05:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
think usually he gets called last um and
 
05:26:04.110 --> 05:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
I want to talk about what this bill
 
05:26:07.190 --> 05:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
covers so it's rent stabilization uh it
 
05:26:11.030 --> 05:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
does not cover non-restricted uh units
 
05:26:13.310 --> 05:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
it does not cover manufactured housing
 
05:26:15.628 --> 05:26:15.638 align:start position:0%
it doesn't cover adus or federally
 
05:26:17.910 --> 05:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
subsidized housing and it doesn't cover
 
05:26:20.190 --> 05:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
housing less than 15 years old if it's
 
05:26:24.948 --> 05:26:24.958 align:start position:0%
built after um the if a town enables uh
 
05:26:27.350 --> 05:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
the rent stabilization so I just want
 
05:26:29.510 --> 05:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
you to realize it's only your basic
 
05:26:31.590 --> 05:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
restricted housing
 
05:26:33.948 --> 05:26:33.958 align:start position:0%
um and the reason this enabling is
 
05:26:36.030 --> 05:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
needed is because these towns are in an
 
05:26:38.190 --> 05:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
emergency situation to provide housing
 
05:26:39.830 --> 05:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
they have to do something this would be
 
05:26:43.670 --> 05:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
an emergency measure that a town would
 
05:26:47.750 --> 05:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh Implement and they would implement it
 
05:26:50.430 --> 05:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
only as an emergency because their
 
05:26:53.910 --> 05:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
inherent um motive is to keep values
 
05:26:56.590 --> 05:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
high and if they Implement something
 
05:26:59.190 --> 05:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
like this they do run the potential risk
 
05:27:01.030 --> 05:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
of suppressing values in their town but
 
05:27:03.030 --> 05:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
as we know right now it's quite the
 
05:27:05.788 --> 05:27:05.798 align:start position:0%
opposite and towns also have the need to
 
05:27:07.830 --> 05:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
provide Workforce housing in their town
 
05:27:11.230 --> 05:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
so this is a tool if they so choose to
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
use it to help balance those Market
 
05:27:17.270 --> 05:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
forces because in the current
 
05:27:20.270 --> 05:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
situation um essentially what we have
 
05:27:22.510 --> 05:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
and I I've testified to this fact in the
 
05:27:25.830 --> 05:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
in the past is a def facto price fixing
 
05:27:28.830 --> 05:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
situation because you don't have a free
 
05:27:31.948 --> 05:27:31.958 align:start position:0%
market when you have a situation where
 
05:27:34.430 --> 05:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
people are forced to buy something like
 
05:27:37.510 --> 05:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
with housing you have no choice so with
 
05:27:39.708 --> 05:27:39.718 align:start position:0%
free market the idea is that the supply
 
05:27:41.628 --> 05:27:41.638 align:start position:0%
side and the demand side are both free
 
05:27:44.390 --> 05:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
to interact and walk away if necessary
 
05:27:46.390 --> 05:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
but when you're forcing someone to buy
 
05:27:48.670 --> 05:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
something because they have no choice in
 
05:27:51.430 --> 05:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
order to live you are tying the hands of
 
05:27:53.708 --> 05:27:53.718 align:start position:0%
one side of that equation and when
 
05:27:55.390 --> 05:27:55.400 align:start position:0%
you're doing that it's no longer a free
 
05:27:57.830 --> 05:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
market and what that means is that
 
05:28:00.910 --> 05:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
landlords have no reason to compete with
 
05:28:03.190 --> 05:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
each other they all benefit from all
 
05:28:04.830 --> 05:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
raising the prices because you're going
 
05:28:06.788 --> 05:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
to pay it
 
05:28:06.798 --> 05:28:08.628 align:start position:0%
to pay it
anyway

05:28:08.628 --> 05:28:08.638 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
05:28:11.990 --> 05:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
so what this does and I want to be clear
 
05:28:14.670 --> 05:28:14.680 align:start position:0%
this is rent stabilization so it limit
 
05:28:18.230 --> 05:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
it allows towns to limit the rental
 
05:28:22.590 --> 05:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
increases on units in their town but not
 
05:28:26.470 --> 05:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
below 5% first of all so I know that
 
05:28:29.070 --> 05:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
last year there we I had a bill that
 
05:28:31.310 --> 05:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
enabled a number of things among them
 
05:28:32.470 --> 05:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
would be what you would call rent
 
05:28:35.708 --> 05:28:35.718 align:start position:0%
control what that is is allowing a town
 
05:28:38.350 --> 05:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
to say a certain number like you can't
 
05:28:41.510 --> 05:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
rent this unit for more than $800 that's
 
05:28:43.628 --> 05:28:43.638 align:start position:0%
not what this says what this says you
 
05:28:46.990 --> 05:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
may be renting it for $4,000 right now
 
05:28:48.628 --> 05:28:48.638 align:start position:0%
and the town would be able to say okay
 
05:28:50.910 --> 05:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
you can't raise it more than 5% next
 
05:28:53.030 --> 05:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
year and that's the worst like that's
 
05:28:54.628 --> 05:28:54.638 align:start position:0%
the lowest they would be able to to
 
05:28:58.350 --> 05:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
restrict that um it also very
 
05:29:00.750 --> 05:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
importantly and and and I I want you to
 
05:29:04.350 --> 05:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
pay attention to this allows for a fair
 
05:29:07.150 --> 05:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
return on investment for landlords so if
 
05:29:09.830 --> 05:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
that 5% or whatever level a town
 
05:29:12.868 --> 05:29:12.878 align:start position:0%
restricts the increase at is not enough
 
05:29:14.670 --> 05:29:14.680 align:start position:0%
for the landlord to recruit reasonable
 
05:29:17.150 --> 05:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
and necessary costs and specifically
 
05:29:18.788 --> 05:29:18.798 align:start position:0%
this will be paragraph three on the
 
05:29:21.310 --> 05:29:21.320 align:start position:0%
second page so that includes property
 
05:29:23.430 --> 05:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
taxes owner paid utilities maintenance
 
05:29:25.350 --> 05:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
and repairs and other reasonable and
 
05:29:28.788 --> 05:29:28.798 align:start position:0%
necessary operating costs if a
 
05:29:32.110 --> 05:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
owner has those increases the owner
 
05:29:34.990 --> 05:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
would be exempt from that that
 
05:29:35.000 --> 05:29:37.510 align:start position:0%
would be exempt from that that
restricted

05:29:37.510 --> 05:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
restricted
 
05:29:39.868 --> 05:29:39.878 align:start position:0%
amount it also for any town that
 
05:29:42.110 --> 05:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
implements a rent stabilization
 
05:29:44.830 --> 05:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
ordinance um would have that town
 
05:29:48.270 --> 05:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
establish a board uh to exempt such
 
05:29:49.708 --> 05:29:49.718 align:start position:0%
landlords so they'd have to have a board
 
05:29:52.150 --> 05:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
to hear the landlords and and and have
 
05:29:55.430 --> 05:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
that evidence brought to them um it also
 
05:29:59.110 --> 05:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
enables towns to have uh or require 100
 
05:30:01.390 --> 05:30:01.400 align:start position:0%
days note 12 days notice of rent
 
05:30:03.310 --> 05:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
increases or the removal of the property
 
05:30:05.390 --> 05:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
from the market right now very
 
05:30:08.390 --> 05:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
frequently people are experiencing
 
05:30:10.788 --> 05:30:10.798 align:start position:0%
30day effectively the the bare minimum
 
05:30:12.990 --> 05:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
is 30-day notice and so if there's like
 
05:30:15.548 --> 05:30:15.558 align:start position:0%
a change in ownership or whatever the
 
05:30:17.548 --> 05:30:17.558 align:start position:0%
next thing they know is there's a huge
 
05:30:19.868 --> 05:30:19.878 align:start position:0%
increase in in rent and they're
 
05:30:22.310 --> 05:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
basically out on their ear and they had
 
05:30:26.270 --> 05:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
have a month or less to to
 
05:30:28.990 --> 05:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
adjust every ordinance that is adopted
 
05:30:32.070 --> 05:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this RSA would expire
 
05:30:34.868 --> 05:30:34.878 align:start position:0%
automatically in five
 
05:30:39.670 --> 05:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
years and uh I also would welcome any
 
05:30:42.628 --> 05:30:42.638 align:start position:0%
landlords that might be in opposition to
 
05:30:45.868 --> 05:30:45.878 align:start position:0%
um discuss potential compromise with me
 
05:30:47.990 --> 05:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
um but we have to do something to
 
05:30:50.830 --> 05:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
address it I think it's very very very
 
05:30:53.990 --> 05:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
clear that doing what we've been doing
 
05:30:57.110 --> 05:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
is leading to dire consequences in this
 
05:30:59.230 --> 05:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
state it's leading to the fact that
 
05:31:02.670 --> 05:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
people cannot live in this state and so
 
05:31:05.150 --> 05:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
I don't think especially in a bill that
 
05:31:08.230 --> 05:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
protects landlord profit protects their
 
05:31:10.230 --> 05:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable return on investment and
 
05:31:12.470 --> 05:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
deals with that crisis I don't think
 
05:31:14.590 --> 05:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
that saying that that's like not fair
 
05:31:18.430 --> 05:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
isn't is is reasonable I'm happy to um
 
05:31:20.310 --> 05:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
engage with the interested parties and
 
05:31:22.030 --> 05:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
see what what wording works for people
 
05:31:25.190 --> 05:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
but we have to do something and with
 
05:31:28.190 --> 05:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
that um I basically covered my main
 
05:31:29.708 --> 05:31:29.718 align:start position:0%
points and I'm happy to answer any
 
05:31:29.718 --> 05:31:32.030 align:start position:0%
points and I'm happy to answer any
questions

05:31:32.030 --> 05:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:31:34.708 --> 05:31:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:37.390 --> 05:31:37.400 align:start position:0%
testimony representative
 
05:31:39.750 --> 05:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you for indulging me Mr
 
05:31:41.310 --> 05:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:31:45.510 --> 05:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
question so on uh line 19 of the bill it
 
05:31:47.788 --> 05:31:47.798 align:start position:0%
talks about minimum constitutionally
 
05:31:49.830 --> 05:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
protected standards can you explain that
 
05:31:52.590 --> 05:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
to me or elaborate on it for me thank
 
05:31:55.948 --> 05:31:55.958 align:start position:0%
you line 19 of the first page
 
05:31:59.230 --> 05:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
yes we're defining Fair return on
 
05:32:01.310 --> 05:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
investment and as I understand it and
 
05:32:04.390 --> 05:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
again this is why I've asked and I'm I
 
05:32:06.390 --> 05:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
feel so disrespectful not being able to
 
05:32:09.670 --> 05:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
see you across the speaker um it's why
 
05:32:13.470 --> 05:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
I've asked for a continuance to allow um
 
05:32:16.150 --> 05:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
the like I said an ex the leading expert
 
05:32:18.990 --> 05:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
who's actually taken this very issue to
 
05:32:21.030 --> 05:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court in New Hampshire so he
 
05:32:22.628 --> 05:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
very intimately understands what the
 
05:32:25.230 --> 05:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
constitutionality is of making sure that
 
05:32:27.910 --> 05:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
landlords are um my understanding from
 
05:32:30.030 --> 05:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
him is that landlords and other business
 
05:32:32.470 --> 05:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
owners have a con constitutionally
 
05:32:35.788 --> 05:32:35.798 align:start position:0%
protected um right to have a fair return
 
05:32:39.788 --> 05:32:39.798 align:start position:0%
on their investment um from government
 
05:32:41.750 --> 05:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
so like government can't impede upon you
 
05:32:43.430 --> 05:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
from having a fair return on on
 
05:32:45.750 --> 05:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
investment and so that is why he is
 
05:32:48.030 --> 05:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
included that and um but he would be
 
05:32:49.990 --> 05:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
able to speak more as an expert to that
 
05:32:56.830 --> 05:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:00.030 --> 05:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
thanks representative majority thank you
 
05:33:02.190 --> 05:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'll be very quick thank you
 
05:33:05.230 --> 05:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question in Roman 2 the
 
05:33:07.230 --> 05:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
first sentence says the governing body
 
05:33:09.430 --> 05:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
created an ordinance the second sentence
 
05:33:12.150 --> 05:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
says ordinance or regulation a
 
05:33:14.788 --> 05:33:14.798 align:start position:0%
nitpicking but an ordinance is binding a
 
05:33:17.708 --> 05:33:17.718 align:start position:0%
regulation is more like a policy what
 
05:33:19.510 --> 05:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
what what would your preference be that
 
05:33:22.510 --> 05:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
it be an ordinance or that it can be as
 
05:33:24.430 --> 05:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say loose but I hope you
 
05:33:27.030 --> 05:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
understand that word as a regulation not
 
05:33:29.548 --> 05:33:29.558 align:start position:0%
being the expert and lawyer that wrote
 
05:33:35.548 --> 05:33:35.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:38.390 --> 05:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:33:41.070 --> 05:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
FR thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:33:46.310 --> 05:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you define this as
 
05:33:49.150 --> 05:33:49.160 align:start position:0%
the ability of a town to act in an
 
05:33:52.590 --> 05:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
emergency situation if I understood you
 
05:33:54.910 --> 05:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
correctly as we currently are I'm sorry
 
05:33:58.430 --> 05:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
and uh how how are you how are you
 
05:34:01.030 --> 05:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
defining an Emer
 
05:34:04.590 --> 05:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
situation and on a Town level who would
 
05:34:07.110 --> 05:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
make that determination and what would
 
05:34:08.990 --> 05:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
the criteria
 
05:34:11.310 --> 05:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
be the determination for what an
 
05:34:13.750 --> 05:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
emergency situation is so it would be
 
05:34:15.868 --> 05:34:15.878 align:start position:0%
for example
 
05:34:19.670 --> 05:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
um Perhaps it is as broad as not being
 
05:34:23.230 --> 05:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
able to meet Workforce housing which is
 
05:34:26.788 --> 05:34:26.798 align:start position:0%
required of them um legally but it may
 
05:34:31.190 --> 05:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
be as narrow as deaths from homelessness
 
05:34:35.190 --> 05:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
like I just said so um yeah we're we're
 
05:34:38.230 --> 05:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
in a crisis the crisis may vary town to
 
05:34:39.948 --> 05:34:39.958 align:start position:0%
town which is why this enabling
 
05:34:41.590 --> 05:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
legislation which does nothing on its
 
05:34:44.868 --> 05:34:44.878 align:start position:0%
own is good but um the who would
 
05:34:46.708 --> 05:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
determine that would be the same bodies
 
05:34:49.070 --> 05:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
that would put the ordinance in so that
 
05:34:51.270 --> 05:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
would be your select board or your Town
 
05:34:53.910 --> 05:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
Council city
 
05:34:56.030 --> 05:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
council representative
 
05:34:59.948 --> 05:34:59.958 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair um can you
 
05:35:02.510 --> 05:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
tell me who is this expert oh Elliot
 
05:35:04.070 --> 05:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
Barry I I did I thought I mentioned his
 
05:35:05.390 --> 05:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
name I'm sorry if I didn't he's the
 
05:35:07.590 --> 05:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
former direct recently retired director
 
05:35:10.548 --> 05:35:10.558 align:start position:0%
of in HLA thank you Mr chair can I have
 
05:35:12.868 --> 05:35:12.878 align:start position:0%
a quick followup go
 
05:35:16.270 --> 05:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you and the the lines that
 
05:35:18.750 --> 05:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh others have mentioned on page one the
 
05:35:20.948 --> 05:35:20.958 align:start position:0%
18 and 19 talking about the
 
05:35:24.070 --> 05:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected
 
05:35:26.548 --> 05:35:26.558 align:start position:0%
standards what are the proofs that
 
05:35:30.990 --> 05:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
somebody has to Pro give to prove that
 
05:35:33.830 --> 05:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
um you know their the their return on
 
05:35:36.868 --> 05:35:36.878 align:start position:0%
investment fits this so it would be the
 
05:35:39.510 --> 05:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
co the cost that I including the costs
 
05:35:41.868 --> 05:35:41.878 align:start position:0%
that I read uh from paragraph three on
 
05:35:45.830 --> 05:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
the second page um so
 
05:35:48.430 --> 05:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
essentially presuming right now that
 
05:35:50.670 --> 05:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
landlords are setting the rent at a rate
 
05:35:52.750 --> 05:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
that gives them you know being free of
 
05:35:54.628 --> 05:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
any other restrictions landlords are
 
05:35:56.830 --> 05:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
setting the rate at what they want so
 
05:35:59.390 --> 05:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
right now we're presuming in the current
 
05:36:01.190 --> 05:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
situ ation they're getting a fair return
 
05:36:03.430 --> 05:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
on investment now something could happen
 
05:36:04.990 --> 05:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
the roof could collapse they might need
 
05:36:06.868 --> 05:36:06.878 align:start position:0%
to repair something the property taxes
 
05:36:08.548 --> 05:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
could go up the utilities that they pay
 
05:36:10.548 --> 05:36:10.558 align:start position:0%
could go up whatever could happen and
 
05:36:12.190 --> 05:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
they come in with those
 
05:36:16.548 --> 05:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:20.590 --> 05:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
you representative got three got three
 
05:36:22.548 --> 05:36:22.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:36:26.390 --> 05:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
your testimony how would this bill help
 
05:36:31.628 --> 05:36:31.638 align:start position:0%
the crisis of the the housing crisis
 
05:36:36.350 --> 05:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
which is a issue of not enough
 
05:36:40.350 --> 05:36:40.360 align:start position:0%
housing so so the housing crisis is
 
05:36:42.510 --> 05:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately an issue of not affordable
 
05:36:44.750 --> 05:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
housing and one of those major factors
 
05:36:46.830 --> 05:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
that is contributing to that is not
 
05:36:49.788 --> 05:36:49.798 align:start position:0%
enough housing so because we have a lack
 
05:36:51.708 --> 05:36:51.718 align:start position:0%
of and I should say we have a lack of
 
05:36:53.990 --> 05:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
units on the market we don't have an
 
05:36:57.390 --> 05:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
actual lack of actual roofs we actually
 
05:37:00.390 --> 05:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
have I believe the number I last looked
 
05:37:03.628 --> 05:37:03.638 align:start position:0%
up and this is maybe 2 years old 72
 
05:37:06.350 --> 05:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
empty homes for every homeless person
 
05:37:09.110 --> 05:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
not family person in this state so we
 
05:37:12.110 --> 05:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
don't actually have a lack of roofs or a
 
05:37:14.150 --> 05:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
lack of houses most of those are
 
05:37:15.990 --> 05:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
vacation homes that are sitting empty
 
05:37:17.990 --> 05:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
and they're not on the market we do have
 
05:37:21.788 --> 05:37:21.798 align:start position:0%
about 60,000 I think units uh too few on
 
05:37:24.230 --> 05:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
the market and that is in part what's
 
05:37:27.670 --> 05:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
contributing to that increase um that is
 
05:37:29.990 --> 05:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
causing it to be unaffordable especially
 
05:37:31.990 --> 05:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
for the young families that the the
 
05:37:35.350 --> 05:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
state really wants to attract so that's
 
05:37:36.948 --> 05:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
first of all that's the the actual
 
05:37:39.830 --> 05:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
crisis how this helps is that what right
 
05:37:43.628 --> 05:37:43.638 align:start position:0%
now we're seeing an exponential boom in
 
05:37:47.310 --> 05:37:47.320 align:start position:0%
the rental levels uh my town alone last
 
05:37:50.190 --> 05:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
year experienced um it was one
 
05:37:52.310 --> 05:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
particular owner who came in and bought
 
05:37:56.150 --> 05:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
about 60% of all of the uh multif family
 
05:37:59.230 --> 05:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
units in the town uh he recently listed
 
05:38:03.070 --> 05:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
them as a package for sale but uh he
 
05:38:06.110 --> 05:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
upon taking ownership increased the rent
 
05:38:07.910 --> 05:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
for those units for people who were not
 
05:38:09.788 --> 05:38:09.798 align:start position:0%
yet out of their or who were out of
 
05:38:11.190 --> 05:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
their lease and were going month-to
 
05:38:11.200 --> 05:38:13.110 align:start position:0%
their lease and were going month-to
Monon

05:38:13.110 --> 05:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
Monon
 
05:38:16.150 --> 05:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
250% So within one month people who were
 
05:38:18.788 --> 05:38:18.798 align:start position:0%
paying $700 $800 were now having to pay
 
05:38:20.350 --> 05:38:20.360 align:start position:0%
like something like
 
05:38:22.670 --> 05:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
$2,700 and obviously that's just not
 
05:38:24.190 --> 05:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
affordable these were the people who
 
05:38:26.590 --> 05:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
worked as post three postal workers
 
05:38:29.548 --> 05:38:29.558 align:start position:0%
actually were impacted for our town um
 
05:38:31.190 --> 05:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
people who worked at our local
 
05:38:33.310 --> 05:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
restaurants um these people were driven
 
05:38:35.548 --> 05:38:35.558 align:start position:0%
out most of them left they were driven
 
05:38:37.628 --> 05:38:37.638 align:start position:0%
out of our town so that is what the
 
05:38:39.310 --> 05:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
housing crisis looks like and what this
 
05:38:41.468 --> 05:38:41.478 align:start position:0%
does and let me be extremely clear this
 
05:38:43.310 --> 05:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
does not reduce the rental level
 
05:38:45.990 --> 05:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
currently set right now what this does
 
05:38:48.708 --> 05:38:48.718 align:start position:0%
is simply allow towns to prevent the
 
05:38:52.270 --> 05:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
continuance of this ridiculous 200 300%
 
05:38:54.548 --> 05:38:54.558 align:start position:0%
rental increases quick followup Mr
 
05:38:57.270 --> 05:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
chairman quickly just a quick question
 
05:39:01.548 --> 05:39:01.558 align:start position:0%
is that proper you were talking mode
 
05:39:04.590 --> 05:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
empty um no I don't think that they're
 
05:39:08.788 --> 05:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
empty they they've attracted people who
 
05:39:11.110 --> 05:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
don't work in our town are not the
 
05:39:12.788 --> 05:39:12.798 align:start position:0%
postal workers are not the sandwich
 
05:39:14.430 --> 05:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
makers are not the people who work at
 
05:39:18.190 --> 05:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
the gas station the the retired veterans
 
05:39:19.990 --> 05:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
they've attracted people I think largely
 
05:39:20.000 --> 05:39:20.830 align:start position:0%
they've attracted people I think largely
from

05:39:20.830 --> 05:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:39:24.030 --> 05:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um who work from home and
 
05:39:25.310 --> 05:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
get paid quite
 
05:39:28.548 --> 05:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
well representative savus thank you Mr
 
05:39:29.788 --> 05:39:29.798 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:39:31.788 --> 05:39:31.798 align:start position:0%
question first of all I apologize
 
05:39:34.030 --> 05:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
because maybe I'm not reading correctly
 
05:39:37.230 --> 05:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
versus what I heard you say um so point
 
05:39:39.750 --> 05:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
out where I'm wrong please um you said
 
05:39:43.270 --> 05:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
that adus were exempt from this yes ad
 
05:39:43.280 --> 05:39:44.628 align:start position:0%
that adus were exempt from this yes ad
well

05:39:44.628 --> 05:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:39:47.270 --> 05:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
specifically ACC accessory structure
 
05:39:50.310 --> 05:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
unit as defined in
 
05:39:53.708 --> 05:39:53.718 align:start position:0%
67471 I guess we could bring up
 
05:39:56.548 --> 05:39:56.558 align:start position:0%
67471 um but tell me in the bill where
 
05:39:59.990 --> 05:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
the exemption language is oh page two uh
 
05:40:02.310 --> 05:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
number five that's line also happens to
 
05:40:04.868 --> 05:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
be line five all the exemptions start on
 
05:40:09.230 --> 05:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
page one uh starting with
 
05:40:12.868 --> 05:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
20 up 29 covered property which is
 
05:40:14.350 --> 05:40:14.360 align:start position:0%
covered by this section means all
 
05:40:16.190 --> 05:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
residential rental structures accept and
 
05:40:19.750 --> 05:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
then there's a numbered list thank
 
05:40:23.590 --> 05:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
05:40:27.310 --> 05:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
gallager um so kind of to follow up on
 
05:40:31.948 --> 05:40:31.958 align:start position:0%
representative guth's question and um so
 
05:40:34.788 --> 05:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
yeah it's often said that um rent
 
05:40:37.150 --> 05:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
control or rent stabilization will have
 
05:40:43.150 --> 05:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
a negative impact on Supply but um we've
 
05:40:46.390 --> 05:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
also got other bills in the work that
 
05:40:51.310 --> 05:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
are more meant to um address the supply
 
05:40:55.830 --> 05:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
side of things so if those both pass um
 
05:40:59.948 --> 05:40:59.958 align:start position:0%
do you think that would be enough to um
 
05:41:03.310 --> 05:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
cover it and um would you
 
05:41:06.670 --> 05:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
um would would you maybe be open to
 
05:41:10.750 --> 05:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
combining um rent control stabilization
 
05:41:12.948 --> 05:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
legislation with some of the more Pro
 
05:41:14.468 --> 05:41:14.478 align:start position:0%
Supply things in the
 
05:41:16.670 --> 05:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
future thank you for the question and I
 
05:41:18.110 --> 05:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
I was very brief when I mentioned the
 
05:41:21.548 --> 05:41:21.558 align:start position:0%
exemption but th this specifically does
 
05:41:25.788 --> 05:41:25.798 align:start position:0%
not cover things that are built after a
 
05:41:27.510 --> 05:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
rent stabiliz and it is stabilization
 
05:41:30.190 --> 05:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
it's not rent control that was last year
 
05:41:33.948 --> 05:41:33.958 align:start position:0%
uh this specifically exempts new
 
05:41:36.590 --> 05:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
structures that are built after a rent
 
05:41:39.990 --> 05:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
stabilization ordinances passed for 15
 
05:41:42.590 --> 05:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
years so it does not have a cooling
 
05:41:46.070 --> 05:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
effect on building having said that
 
05:41:48.150 --> 05:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
towns are kind of stuck because they
 
05:41:50.628 --> 05:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
have to supply Workforce housing and
 
05:41:53.510 --> 05:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
they are famously as you all know
 
05:41:55.788 --> 05:41:55.798 align:start position:0%
against anything like the measures we've
 
05:41:59.430 --> 05:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
seen that increase density so how do you
 
05:42:02.150 --> 05:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
this if you don't want to loosen up uh
 
05:42:04.070 --> 05:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances to allow for more
 
05:42:05.910 --> 05:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
density but you have to meet Workforce
 
05:42:08.708 --> 05:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
housing this allows them to start doing
 
05:42:12.270 --> 05:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
that again it doesn't reduce any rents
 
05:42:14.468 --> 05:42:14.478 align:start position:0%
but it prevents this in increasing
 
05:42:17.910 --> 05:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
expansion of rental uh amounts that
 
05:42:20.230 --> 05:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
we're experiencing and it allows them to
 
05:42:23.110 --> 05:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
do that without cooling new building
 
05:42:25.670 --> 05:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
structures so or new building of new
 
05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
structures for 15
 
05:42:28.160 --> 05:42:30.310 align:start position:0%
structures for 15
years

05:42:30.310 --> 05:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:42:32.868 --> 05:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
oh oops I didn't realize my yeah
 
05:42:35.948 --> 05:42:35.958 align:start position:0%
thanks representative
 
05:42:39.150 --> 05:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
lales thank you for taking my
 
05:42:42.910 --> 05:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
question so this is enabling legislation
 
05:42:45.430 --> 05:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
correct so we could have two towns
 
05:42:49.150 --> 05:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
sitting right beside each other one
 
05:42:53.350 --> 05:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
adopts the law the other does not a
 
05:42:56.548 --> 05:42:56.558 align:start position:0%
developer comes in and he's wanting to
 
05:43:00.430 --> 05:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
locate some apartment house houses which
 
05:43:02.070 --> 05:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
one is he going to
 
05:43:05.270 --> 05:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
choose so this is a factor that a Town
 
05:43:07.070 --> 05:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
Council or select board would have to
 
05:43:09.468 --> 05:43:09.478 align:start position:0%
take into consideration before passing
 
05:43:12.990 --> 05:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
this but my point is that it's
 
05:43:15.510 --> 05:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
Laboratories of democracy every town has
 
05:43:18.150 --> 05:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
to decide what's right for them this is
 
05:43:20.150 --> 05:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
enabling only it doesn't do anything on
 
05:43:22.990 --> 05:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
its own if this is going to impact
 
05:43:25.628 --> 05:43:25.638 align:start position:0%
negatively negatively impact that town
 
05:43:27.830 --> 05:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
then the select board or Town Council
 
05:43:30.150 --> 05:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
would likely not pass it but if they
 
05:43:33.110 --> 05:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
weigh everything and go the the benefits
 
05:43:36.030 --> 05:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
outweigh the the cost the negatives the
 
05:43:38.310 --> 05:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
potential scaring off somebody who again
 
05:43:41.230 --> 05:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
they would be exempt for 15 years anyway
 
05:43:42.628 --> 05:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
but let's say they're worried about
 
05:43:45.030 --> 05:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
building because in the 16th year they
 
05:43:46.708 --> 05:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to continue increasing
 
05:43:48.948 --> 05:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
potentially continue increasing then
 
05:43:50.468 --> 05:43:50.478 align:start position:0%
that's something that Town Council has
 
05:43:52.468 --> 05:43:52.478 align:start position:0%
to to weigh and if they decide that
 
05:43:54.590 --> 05:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
that's too costly for them then they
 
05:43:56.150 --> 05:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
won't do it but again every single
 
05:43:58.190 --> 05:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
ordinance passed pursuant to this
 
05:44:03.110 --> 05:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:05.628 --> 05:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
years seeing no more questions thank you
 
05:44:07.708 --> 05:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you so
 
05:44:17.750 --> 05:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:19.948 --> 05:44:19.958 align:start position:0%
Klein uh thank you Mr chairman members
 
05:44:21.628 --> 05:44:21.638 align:start position:0%
of the committee for this opportunity to
 
05:44:24.030 --> 05:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
speak uh my name is Drew Klein I'm
 
05:44:25.628 --> 05:44:25.638 align:start position:0%
president of the Josiah Bartlett Center
 
05:44:26.910 --> 05:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
for Public Policy which is New
 
05:44:29.230 --> 05:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's free market Think Tank um
 
05:44:31.190 --> 05:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
and I would say that we we're here in
 
05:44:32.628 --> 05:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
response to this bill really to just
 
05:44:34.868 --> 05:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
issue a warning uh based on the effects
 
05:44:36.628 --> 05:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
of what will inevitably happen if this
 
05:44:39.510 --> 05:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
bill passes the language in the bill uh
 
05:44:42.548 --> 05:44:42.558 align:start position:0%
is allowable rent increase um You can
 
05:44:44.390 --> 05:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
call it stabilization all you want but
 
05:44:47.150 --> 05:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
that is a that is a price cap and that
 
05:44:51.230 --> 05:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
is rent control and there is there's
 
05:44:53.110 --> 05:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
really only a handful of
 
05:44:57.110 --> 05:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
issues um that really bringing together
 
05:44:59.030 --> 05:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
economists of the left and the right
 
05:45:01.788 --> 05:45:01.798 align:start position:0%
right and rent control is one of them
 
05:45:04.190 --> 05:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
there's almost Universal agreement of
 
05:45:06.750 --> 05:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
the devastating effect that rent control
 
05:45:12.070 --> 05:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
has um it universally is recognized as
 
05:45:15.150 --> 05:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
reducing both the quality and the
 
05:45:19.310 --> 05:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:22.230 --> 05:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
housing and to show you how
 
05:45:24.990 --> 05:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
ideologically broad this consensus is I
 
05:45:27.030 --> 05:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
one of my favorite probably my
 
05:45:29.708 --> 05:45:29.718 align:start position:0%
favorite Paul Krugman colum The leftwing
 
05:45:32.150 --> 05:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
Economist in the New York Times uh was
 
05:45:33.390 --> 05:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
one he wrote in
 
05:45:36.830 --> 05:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
2000 where he was responding to a story
 
05:45:38.868 --> 05:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
The New York Times had on the really
 
05:45:41.230 --> 05:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
dire situation that San Francisco was
 
05:45:42.948 --> 05:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
dealing with in housing where San
 
05:45:45.548 --> 05:45:45.558 align:start position:0%
Francisco renters the New York Times
 
05:45:47.468 --> 05:45:47.478 align:start position:0%
headline called them supplicants to the
 
05:45:50.070 --> 05:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
landlords that's how bad the problem had
 
05:45:52.548 --> 05:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
gotten where landlords were requiring
 
05:45:52.558 --> 05:45:53.990 align:start position:0%
gotten where landlords were requiring
renters

05:45:53.990 --> 05:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
renters
 
05:45:58.150 --> 05:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
to dress nice interview show them all
 
05:46:00.990 --> 05:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
kinds of resumes not not just dealing
 
05:46:02.670 --> 05:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
with an economic issue here but the
 
05:46:04.830 --> 05:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
landlords had such power over the
 
05:46:07.350 --> 05:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
renters and Krugman wrote that he could
 
05:46:09.310 --> 05:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
tell just by reading the story even
 
05:46:11.190 --> 05:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
though it didn't mention rent
 
05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
control that San Francisco had a rent
 
05:46:15.468 --> 05:46:15.478 align:start position:0%
control policy and sure enough he looked
 
05:46:17.190 --> 05:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
it up and found that San Francisco had a
 
05:46:20.030 --> 05:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
rent control policy and he wrote that
 
05:46:22.270 --> 05:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
that's what happens when you have rent
 
05:46:24.830 --> 05:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
control and just a quote from his column
 
05:46:26.750 --> 05:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh the analysis of rent control is among
 
05:46:28.868 --> 05:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
the best understood in all of economics
 
05:46:31.948 --> 05:46:31.958 align:start position:0%
and among economists any uh among
 
05:46:35.430 --> 05:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
economists any way and one of the least
 
05:46:37.830 --> 05:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
controversial almost every freshman
 
05:46:40.030 --> 05:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
level textbook contains a case study on
 
05:46:42.430 --> 05:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
rent control using its known adverse
 
05:46:43.708 --> 05:46:43.718 align:start position:0%
side effects to illustrate the
 
05:46:45.430 --> 05:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
principles of supply and demand as from
 
05:46:45.440 --> 05:46:47.270 align:start position:0%

Krugman just to give you a just a really
 
05:46:51.230 --> 05:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
quick example of some of the recent
 
05:46:53.350 --> 05:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
research on rent control St Paul
 
05:46:54.788 --> 05:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
Minnesota passed a rent control
 
05:46:57.270 --> 05:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
ordinance in 2021 a University of
 
05:46:59.750 --> 05:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
Southern California study in
 
05:47:02.270 --> 05:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
2022 found that rent control cause
 
05:47:04.150 --> 05:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
property values to Fall by
 
05:47:09.750 --> 05:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
66 to 7% That's a $1.6 billion loss in
 
05:47:12.750 --> 05:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
property value in a
 
05:47:15.708 --> 05:47:15.718 align:start position:0%
year a 2018 study of rent control back
 
05:47:19.190 --> 05:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
to San Francisco found that it reduced
 
05:47:22.190 --> 05:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
the supply of rent and housing by
 
05:47:25.510 --> 05:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
15% and raised rents by
 
05:47:28.468 --> 05:47:28.478 align:start position:0%
5% well how did it raise rents by 5%
 
05:47:30.430 --> 05:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
well not every unit is controlled by the
 
05:47:32.030 --> 05:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
rent Control Ordinance as would be the
 
05:47:34.510 --> 05:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
case here when you limit when you put a
 
05:47:36.190 --> 05:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
price cap on some units you will
 
05:47:37.910 --> 05:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
inevitably raise the rent of the other
 
05:47:41.430 --> 05:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
units everyone is going to be worse off
 
05:47:43.110 --> 05:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
Cambridge Massachusetts famously had
 
05:47:46.070 --> 05:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
rent control for 24
 
05:47:48.788 --> 05:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
years when that policy was lifted in
 
05:47:53.788 --> 05:47:53.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:55.868 --> 05:47:55.878 align:start position:0%
afterwards lifting rent control in
 
05:47:58.628 --> 05:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
Cambridge Mass more than doubled the
 
05:48:00.270 --> 05:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
direct dollar investments in new
 
05:48:04.910 --> 05:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:07.590 --> 05:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
Mass that is astonishing I won't read
 
05:48:09.070 --> 05:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
the rest here I've submitted this
 
05:48:11.310 --> 05:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
written testimony what happens when you
 
05:48:14.110 --> 05:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
have rent control even if you do it in
 
05:48:15.788 --> 05:48:15.798 align:start position:0%
the way this bill does which is try to
 
05:48:17.548 --> 05:48:17.558 align:start position:0%
limit it try to keep the ordinance short
 
05:48:20.430 --> 05:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
try to exempt new apartments inevitably
 
05:48:21.910 --> 05:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
05:48:24.910 --> 05:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
is you reduce the value of rental
 
05:48:26.830 --> 05:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
properties you reduce the value of all
 
05:48:28.390 --> 05:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
rental properties not just the ones that
 
05:48:30.868 --> 05:48:30.878 align:start position:0%
are covered by this ordinance this
 
05:48:32.948 --> 05:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
ordinance uh you would enable
 
05:48:34.430 --> 05:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have a 5-year
 
05:48:36.830 --> 05:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
ordinance that would have to expire
 
05:48:39.628 --> 05:48:39.638 align:start position:0%
after five years okay so let's say some
 
05:48:42.230 --> 05:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
investor takes a a
 
05:48:42.240 --> 05:48:43.788 align:start position:0%
investor takes a a
risk

05:48:43.788 --> 05:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
risk
 
05:48:47.788 --> 05:48:47.798 align:start position:0%
and decides erroneously to build an rent
 
05:48:49.990 --> 05:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
control town after the ordinance kicks
 
05:48:52.270 --> 05:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
into effect instead of the town next
 
05:48:54.390 --> 05:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
door that doesn't have
 
05:48:56.468 --> 05:48:56.478 align:start position:0%
one what happens when that ordinance
 
05:48:58.750 --> 05:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
expires in 5 years he's got anart
 
05:49:00.510 --> 05:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
building there the new rent Control
 
05:49:02.830 --> 05:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
Ordinance kicks in um I think and you
 
05:49:04.230 --> 05:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
would have to ask the sponsor I could be
 
05:49:05.628 --> 05:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
wrong but it would assume that that new
 
05:49:06.750 --> 05:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
building would then be covered by the
 
05:49:08.590 --> 05:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
rent Control
 
05:49:12.030 --> 05:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
Ordinance New Hampshire does have a
 
05:49:14.788 --> 05:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
massive problem with rental with a
 
05:49:16.548 --> 05:49:16.558 align:start position:0%
shortage of rental housing we all know
 
05:49:19.670 --> 05:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
this I agree with the bill sponsor on
 
05:49:22.868 --> 05:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
that the reason you can look this up we
 
05:49:25.230 --> 05:49:25.240 align:start position:0%
did in state is is available through
 
05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
State data the building permits tell the
 
05:49:31.788 --> 05:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
story in 2013 New Hampshire's apartment
 
05:49:33.510 --> 05:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate was
 
05:49:36.310 --> 05:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
3.4% that's just 10 years
 
05:49:39.830 --> 05:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
ago last year it's
 
05:49:42.830 --> 05:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
0.6% go look up the building permits you
 
05:49:45.350 --> 05:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
will see a sharp decline in the number
 
05:49:47.510 --> 05:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
of building permits issued this is not a
 
05:49:50.150 --> 05:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
free market problem we have a shortage
 
05:49:51.468 --> 05:49:51.478 align:start position:0%
of rental housing because local
 
05:49:53.030 --> 05:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
governments have made it illegal to
 
05:49:55.270 --> 05:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
build rental housing J High Bartlett
 
05:49:58.868 --> 05:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
Center published a study in 2021
 
05:50:00.910 --> 05:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that our housing problem
 
05:50:03.230 --> 05:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is a shortage created
 
05:50:05.590 --> 05:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
by local government ordinances you will
 
05:50:07.190 --> 05:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
make that problem
 
05:50:10.910 --> 05:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
worse with this bill you will that if
 
05:50:12.788 --> 05:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
this bill passes our vacancy rate will
 
05:50:14.390 --> 05:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
go down not
 
05:50:16.948 --> 05:50:16.958 align:start position:0%
up that's just the inevitable math that
 
05:50:20.548 --> 05:50:20.558 align:start position:0%
will follow so as as good as this sounds
 
05:50:23.350 --> 05:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
the answer to our shortage of housing is
 
05:50:26.750 --> 05:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
not to create a bigger shortage it's to
 
05:50:28.230 --> 05:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
get government out of the way to allow
 
05:50:29.990 --> 05:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
more units to be constructed we have to
 
05:50:32.110 --> 05:50:32.120 align:start position:0%
solve that building permit problem
 
05:50:35.190 --> 05:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
that's the problem we face with that I'm
 
05:50:37.468 --> 05:50:37.478 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions thank you for
 
05:50:39.350 --> 05:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
your testimony representative
 
05:50:44.230 --> 05:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
gallager um so a lot of the
 
05:50:47.788 --> 05:50:47.798 align:start position:0%
um case studies you mentioned were about
 
05:50:49.390 --> 05:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
rent control
 
05:50:55.788 --> 05:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
specifically um but uh this bill uh
 
05:50:59.030 --> 05:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
takes great pains to be about
 
05:51:02.390 --> 05:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
stabilization instead um so I was
 
05:51:04.910 --> 05:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
wondering um if you
 
05:51:08.590 --> 05:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
had if you could use examples instead
 
05:51:11.190 --> 05:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
that were of rent stabilization
 
05:51:13.670 --> 05:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
specifically instead of rent control I
 
05:51:15.390 --> 05:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
think I think rent stabilization is a
 
05:51:18.390 --> 05:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
term of art not a um economic term it's
 
05:51:20.390 --> 05:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
a price cap which is a rent control it's
 
05:51:22.468 --> 05:51:22.478 align:start position:0%
all rent
 
05:51:24.868 --> 05:51:24.878 align:start position:0%
control further
 
05:51:27.430 --> 05:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gilman thank
 
05:51:29.070 --> 05:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:51:33.110 --> 05:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
question sure um in talking about the uh
 
05:51:35.670 --> 05:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
how the ordinances are holding back rent
 
05:51:40.190 --> 05:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
rentable units is that um how would that
 
05:51:43.788 --> 05:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
be solved would it be Sol because well
 
05:51:44.868 --> 05:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
how would that
 
05:51:47.628 --> 05:51:47.638 align:start position:0%
be I wish I had the easy answer to that
 
05:51:49.070 --> 05:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative that is the tricky
 
05:51:51.430 --> 05:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
question um look the the easy the short
 
05:51:53.350 --> 05:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
answer is local governments have to
 
05:51:55.430 --> 05:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
relax their ordinances and allow more
 
05:51:57.110 --> 05:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
density and allow more units to be built
 
05:51:58.708 --> 05:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
that's the simple answer I mean it's
 
05:52:01.750 --> 05:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's not simple in practice but that
 
05:52:04.270 --> 05:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
that's the problem we're facing I gave a
 
05:52:05.868 --> 05:52:05.878 align:start position:0%
little leeway on that one that was
 
05:52:07.468 --> 05:52:07.478 align:start position:0%
actually not part of our bill
 
05:52:10.110 --> 05:52:10.120 align:start position:0%
representative but I allowed the
 
05:52:13.350 --> 05:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
testimony to go forward representative
 
05:52:15.910 --> 05:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so kind of a similar
 
05:52:18.390 --> 05:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
question to the one I asked to
 
05:52:21.628 --> 05:52:21.638 align:start position:0%
representative Reed um so you mentioned
 
05:52:25.190 --> 05:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that the solution here
 
05:52:29.190 --> 05:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
is to um
 
05:52:31.990 --> 05:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
is to get permitting out of the way do
 
05:52:33.708 --> 05:52:33.718 align:start position:0%
zonning reforms to make it easier to
 
05:52:37.628 --> 05:52:37.638 align:start position:0%
build more um not rent control or grent
 
05:52:40.070 --> 05:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
stabilization okay but what if we did
 
05:52:43.910 --> 05:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
both like would would you consider say a
 
05:52:46.868 --> 05:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
compromise package where we do both
 
05:52:50.548 --> 05:52:50.558 align:start position:0%
zoning reform and rent control to be um
 
05:52:52.708 --> 05:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
acceptable anytime you put rent control
 
05:52:54.390 --> 05:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
in in any form you will get fewer
 
05:52:56.830 --> 05:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
apartments and and and less construction
 
05:52:58.390 --> 05:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
than you would otherwise get so I don't
 
05:53:01.150 --> 05:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
why you would um allow more construction
 
05:53:02.670 --> 05:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
and then put a policy in that would
 
05:53:07.310 --> 05:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:10.110 --> 05:53:10.120 align:start position:0%
possible further
 
05:53:13.670 --> 05:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
questions I have one okay is it fair to
 
05:53:15.350 --> 05:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
say that rent control by Any Other Name
 
05:53:18.270 --> 05:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
Is Still rent control yeah um and I I
 
05:53:20.750 --> 05:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
guess I would end on a quote from my my
 
05:53:22.868 --> 05:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
all-time favorite economics quote is by
 
05:53:26.190 --> 05:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
a Swedish Economist um who I think put
 
05:53:29.030 --> 05:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
it really well he is is um his name is
 
05:53:30.948 --> 05:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
assar lindbeck and reviewing the
 
05:53:32.548 --> 05:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
literature on rent control he said in
 
05:53:34.310 --> 05:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
many cases rent control appears to me
 
05:53:36.270 --> 05:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
the most efficient technique presently
 
05:53:40.830 --> 05:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
known to destroy a city except for
 
05:53:43.708 --> 05:53:43.718 align:start position:0%
bombing thank you for that so you no
 
05:53:45.070 --> 05:53:45.080 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you for your
 
05:53:48.430 --> 05:53:48.440 align:start position:0%

sorry for the interruption you may
 
05:55:47.150 --> 05:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
continue all right uh I'd first like to
 
05:55:48.788 --> 05:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
address a flawed statement made by the
 
05:55:50.708 --> 05:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor um that we don't have a
 
05:55:53.150 --> 05:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
shortage respectfully um per the New
 
05:55:54.868 --> 05:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority's
 
05:55:58.110 --> 05:55:58.120 align:start position:0%
annual report for 2023 it said the state
 
05:56:00.868 --> 05:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
2023 Statewide housing needs assessment
 
05:56:02.468 --> 05:56:02.478 align:start position:0%
was published this year and included
 
05:56:04.590 --> 05:56:04.600 align:start position:0%
some Stark numbers
 
05:56:07.190 --> 05:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
23670 housing units are needed now to
 
05:56:09.670 --> 05:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
stabilize our housing market it also
 
05:56:11.788 --> 05:56:11.798 align:start position:0%
noted that by 2040 we will need nearly
 
05:56:14.788 --> 05:56:14.798 align:start position:0%
990,000 more units than we have today I
 
05:56:16.390 --> 05:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
would like to agree with the previous
 
05:56:17.948 --> 05:56:17.958 align:start position:0%
gentleman that right now we have a
 
05:56:20.990 --> 05:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
building permit and Supply constraint um
 
05:56:24.390 --> 05:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
and our uh internal Think Tank New
 
05:56:25.788 --> 05:56:25.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority that
 
05:56:27.868 --> 05:56:27.878 align:start position:0%
is charged with Gathering the data and
 
05:56:29.190 --> 05:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
supporting that in support of
 
05:56:31.750 --> 05:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
Distributing federal funds uh clearly
 
05:56:35.788 --> 05:56:35.798 align:start position:0%
agrees 100% with that assessment um
 
05:56:38.150 --> 05:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
stabilization uh is merely a semantic
 
05:56:40.868 --> 05:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
disguise uh to cloak what this really is
 
05:56:43.430 --> 05:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
and that this is rent control this bill
 
05:56:45.070 --> 05:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
eliminates a landlord's ability to set
 
05:56:46.868 --> 05:56:46.878 align:start position:0%
their own rents instead the rents would
 
05:56:48.628 --> 05:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
be entirely under the purview of a local
 
05:56:50.708 --> 05:56:50.718 align:start position:0%
government body to determine what is and
 
05:56:52.990 --> 05:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
is not a fair return on investment to
 
05:56:55.830 --> 05:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
yield a fair return if a municipality
 
05:56:58.670 --> 05:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
opted to undertake this
 
05:57:00.708 --> 05:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
um ordinance in New Hampshire the
 
05:57:02.110 --> 05:57:02.120 align:start position:0%
determination of what is an acceptable
 
05:57:03.548 --> 05:57:03.558 align:start position:0%
rate of return for rental has always
 
05:57:05.390 --> 05:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
been in the hands of the property owner
 
05:57:07.150 --> 05:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
and the general free market forces to
 
05:57:10.310 --> 05:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
determine not the government under 1362
 
05:57:12.030 --> 05:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
the government would take control of
 
05:57:13.548 --> 05:57:13.558 align:start position:0%
deciding how much money a property owner
 
05:57:15.468 --> 05:57:15.478 align:start position:0%
is allowed to make I grew up in the live
 
05:57:17.070 --> 05:57:17.080 align:start position:0%
fre or die State and I want to stay in
 
05:57:19.030 --> 05:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
one that's governed fairly and opposed
 
05:57:21.628 --> 05:57:21.638 align:start position:0%
to overregulation what happens if a
 
05:57:22.868 --> 05:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
property owner decides to make
 
05:57:24.708 --> 05:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
significant Renovations or improvements
 
05:57:26.948 --> 05:57:26.958 align:start position:0%
to a building new bathrooms new kitchens
 
05:57:30.590 --> 05:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
HVAC roof or improving other amenities
 
05:57:33.070 --> 05:57:33.080 align:start position:0%
on the property that might um be
 
05:57:35.150 --> 05:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
beneficial for the lifestyle or for the
 
05:57:37.990 --> 05:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
safety of the property uh or as I
 
05:57:39.708 --> 05:57:39.718 align:start position:0%
testified regarding previous year's
 
05:57:41.430 --> 05:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
legislation if taxes and insurance
 
05:57:43.990 --> 05:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
drastically inrease on the property will
 
05:57:45.628 --> 05:57:45.638 align:start position:0%
the property owner have to run each and
 
05:57:47.430 --> 05:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
every item by this government entity to
 
05:57:49.788 --> 05:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
seek rent approvals prior to this to
 
05:57:52.390 --> 05:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
raise them to cover these costs or do
 
05:57:54.310 --> 05:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
they try to app earn the approval only
 
05:57:56.390 --> 05:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
after the construction is completed or
 
05:57:58.070 --> 05:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
do they simply not make the Improv ments
 
05:57:59.390 --> 05:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
which is happening in New York and San
 
05:58:01.350 --> 05:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
Francisco where rent stabilization has
 
05:58:03.350 --> 05:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
been enacted and let structures fall
 
05:58:05.948 --> 05:58:05.958 align:start position:0%
into disrepair or do they follow the
 
05:58:07.548 --> 05:58:07.558 align:start position:0%
state of provision and remove them from
 
05:58:09.468 --> 05:58:09.478 align:start position:0%
the rental market further reducing the
 
05:58:11.390 --> 05:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
supply that we're already finding to be
 
05:58:11.400 --> 05:58:12.350 align:start position:0%
supply that we're already finding to be
very

05:58:12.350 --> 05:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:58:14.350 --> 05:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
problematic so what if there are cost
 
05:58:16.788 --> 05:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
overruns unforeseen circumstances or
 
05:58:18.990 --> 05:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
increases in construction costs while
 
05:58:21.350 --> 05:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
this is going on uh will the property
 
05:58:22.788 --> 05:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
owner have to treat this new government
 
05:58:24.788 --> 05:58:24.798 align:start position:0%
entity as a sort of construction manager
 
05:58:26.310 --> 05:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
waiting for approval on materials and
 
05:58:28.350 --> 05:58:28.360 align:start position:0%
labor cost before moving forward forward
 
05:58:31.868 --> 05:58:31.878 align:start position:0%
to complete necessary repairs for
 
05:58:33.708 --> 05:58:33.718 align:start position:0%
habitability and the bill seems to
 
05:58:35.788 --> 05:58:35.798 align:start position:0%
require that a property with a $5,000 a
 
05:58:37.788 --> 05:58:37.798 align:start position:0%
month rent be treated the same as those
 
05:58:40.030 --> 05:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
with $1,000 a month affordable rent
 
05:58:41.390 --> 05:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
we're not sure why those in the highest
 
05:58:43.070 --> 05:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
price units would need the same type of
 
05:58:45.628 --> 05:58:45.638 align:start position:0%
protection extended to them or is the
 
05:58:47.270 --> 05:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
intent that the municipalities can pick
 
05:58:49.270 --> 05:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
and choose which types of units they
 
05:58:51.868 --> 05:58:51.878 align:start position:0%
would control under these ordinances
 
05:58:53.788 --> 05:58:53.798 align:start position:0%
that seems problematic and open to many
 
05:58:55.390 --> 05:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
legal disasters that could create cost
 
05:58:56.910 --> 05:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
increases that trickle down and the
 
05:58:59.030 --> 05:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
battles that come from from them also
 
05:59:00.510 --> 05:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
this could enable towns to become even
 
05:59:02.150 --> 05:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
less friendly to investment growth and
 
05:59:03.990 --> 05:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
free market stabilization as pointed out
 
05:59:06.708 --> 05:59:06.718 align:start position:0%
by the previous uh gentleman ultimately
 
05:59:08.868 --> 05:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
this would make an already tight rental
 
05:59:11.430 --> 05:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
market worse excuse me it will clearly
 
05:59:12.830 --> 05:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
disincentivize those who want to
 
05:59:14.510 --> 05:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
construct multif family housing due to
 
05:59:16.868 --> 05:59:16.878 align:start position:0%
the Future uncertainty and the less
 
05:59:18.430 --> 05:59:18.440 align:start position:0%
total housing units that's something
 
05:59:19.948 --> 05:59:19.958 align:start position:0%
we've been fighting to avoid in support
 
05:59:21.150 --> 05:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
of housing affordability and
 
05:59:23.230 --> 05:59:23.240 align:start position:0%
availability Realtors understand the
 
05:59:24.830 --> 05:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned impulse behind this
 
05:59:26.830 --> 05:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
bill however the better answer to the
 
05:59:27.990 --> 05:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
problem of scarce housing housing and
 
05:59:29.708 --> 05:59:29.718 align:start position:0%
increasing rents is to increase the
 
05:59:31.868 --> 05:59:31.878 align:start position:0%
housing Supply rather than control
 
05:59:33.708 --> 05:59:33.718 align:start position:0%
prices which discourages investment in
 
05:59:35.590 --> 05:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
housing and I'll wrap up with mentioning
 
05:59:37.548 --> 05:59:37.558 align:start position:0%
that with more units on the market the
 
05:59:39.750 --> 05:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
rents will stabilize it's always what
 
05:59:41.590 --> 05:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
happens when demand meets Supply in
 
05:59:43.230 --> 05:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
order to expand housing we need to
 
05:59:44.948 --> 05:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
expand property rights in New Hampshire
 
05:59:52.510 --> 05:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:55.070 --> 05:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
overregulation to legislate plenty of
 
05:59:56.468 --> 05:59:56.478 align:start position:0%
other governments have made mistakes in
 
05:59:57.910 --> 05:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
this area that we can learn from so
 
05:59:59.270 --> 05:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
let's not make the mistakes that we
 
06:00:02.670 --> 06:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
could learn from elsewhere thank you
 
06:00:05.670 --> 06:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony do we have
 
06:00:09.150 --> 06:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gallagher so
 
06:00:11.310 --> 06:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
yeah same question as I asked to the
 
06:00:14.990 --> 06:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
previous two testifiers um so you
 
06:00:17.788 --> 06:00:17.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned um we should be doing these
 
06:00:19.948 --> 06:00:19.958 align:start position:0%
supply side things like permitting
 
06:00:23.270 --> 06:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
reform and Zoning reform um would
 
06:00:26.628 --> 06:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be possible to reduce the
 
06:00:30.990 --> 06:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
costs of of perating and Zoning enough
 
06:00:32.708 --> 06:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
so that
 
06:00:36.948 --> 06:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
um that it's actually less than the
 
06:00:38.150 --> 06:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
amount that's
 
06:00:41.510 --> 06:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
being or I I mean more than the amount
 
06:00:43.670 --> 06:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's being kept so it ends up being a
 
06:00:45.110 --> 06:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
net positive
 
06:00:47.948 --> 06:00:47.958 align:start position:0%
anyways uh I don't have the math right
 
06:00:49.788 --> 06:00:49.798 align:start position:0%
sorry we we're not going to answer that
 
06:00:52.150 --> 06:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
question we try to keep our questions
 
06:00:54.590 --> 06:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
specifically to the bill and that has
 
06:00:57.628 --> 06:00:57.638 align:start position:0%
gone off off offside the bill do we have
 
06:00:59.430 --> 06:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
other further
 
06:01:01.750 --> 06:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
06:01:04.150 --> 06:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
FR thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
06:01:09.190 --> 06:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question um would you agree or
 
06:01:13.030 --> 06:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
disagree with the hypothesis that one of
 
06:01:15.390 --> 06:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
the limiting factors to
 
06:01:18.948 --> 06:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
increasing housing Supply in this state
 
06:01:23.150 --> 06:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
is the availability or lack there of of
 
06:01:25.910 --> 06:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure specifically water and
 
06:01:30.868 --> 06:01:30.878 align:start position:0%
sewer and for the carrying capacity of
 
06:01:35.030 --> 06:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
land that is not on Municipal
 
06:01:37.310 --> 06:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and if the answer to the
 
06:01:42.548 --> 06:01:42.558 align:start position:0%
question is yes can you estimate um what
 
06:01:44.750 --> 06:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
percentage or okay we're going to stop
 
06:01:46.868 --> 06:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
the question on that that's also totally
 
06:01:50.190 --> 06:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
unrelated to rent uh
 
06:01:52.230 --> 06:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
stabilization are there any questions
 
06:01:54.510 --> 06:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
about the bill I mean these are all
 
06:01:56.590 --> 06:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
great questions don't get me wrong but
 
06:01:58.190 --> 06:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
they're not specific to what we're
 
06:02:01.628 --> 06:02:01.638 align:start position:0%
talking about here F questions thank you
 
06:02:03.230 --> 06:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony thank you
 
06:02:09.830 --> 06:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:11.830 --> 06:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
Scher I was going to say good morning
 
06:02:13.310 --> 06:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
but it's definitely
 
06:02:16.468 --> 06:02:16.478 align:start position:0%
afternoon apologize I had the flu laugh
 
06:02:19.590 --> 06:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
world I'm losing my voice um I'll make
 
06:02:21.270 --> 06:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
this quick because the previous speakers
 
06:02:22.830 --> 06:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
have really covered a lot of the
 
06:02:26.788 --> 06:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
important um bits my name is Chris I am
 
06:02:28.670 --> 06:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
a principal at Elm grve companies we're
 
06:02:30.948 --> 06:02:30.958 align:start position:0%
a we're a developer and property
 
06:02:32.510 --> 06:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
management firm here in New Hampshire we
 
06:02:34.750 --> 06:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
own and manage approximately 1600
 
06:02:38.390 --> 06:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
Apartments um including um a well
 
06:02:39.750 --> 06:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
approximately 600 of those are
 
06:02:41.628 --> 06:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
low-income housing tax credit um
 
06:02:45.070 --> 06:02:45.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing um projects matter of
 
06:02:47.670 --> 06:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
fact we just finished one in Salem last
 
06:02:51.750 --> 06:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
week um to I've done a lot of lease UPS
 
06:02:54.150 --> 06:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
in my day after doing uh building a new
 
06:02:57.510 --> 06:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
development project and we typically
 
06:02:58.990 --> 06:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
take about 6 months to fill up a
 
06:03:00.910 --> 06:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
building we started taking applications
 
06:03:03.830 --> 06:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
in December and um as of our ribbon
 
06:03:05.948 --> 06:03:05.958 align:start position:0%
cutting we're 100% pre-leased And we
 
06:03:08.070 --> 06:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
expect everybody to be moved in by the
 
06:03:12.110 --> 06:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
end of February um so that puts a point
 
06:03:14.628 --> 06:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
to the fact that we we do indeed have a
 
06:03:17.590 --> 06:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
a serious housing crisis and uh demand
 
06:03:22.230 --> 06:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
is very very high um however uh HP 1362
 
06:03:23.788 --> 06:03:23.798 align:start position:0%
I don't believe is the answer and we've
 
06:03:26.270 --> 06:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
all heard you know the the quote about
 
06:03:28.590 --> 06:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
pornography I I can't Define it but I
 
06:03:32.070 --> 06:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
know what it is when I see it uh HB 1362
 
06:03:34.310 --> 06:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
is is indeed rank control rent control
 
06:03:35.990 --> 06:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
has never succeeded in solving housing
 
06:03:38.750 --> 06:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
affordability wherever it isn't enacted
 
06:03:40.510 --> 06:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
it fails and it creates its own set of
 
06:03:42.990 --> 06:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
un unintended consequences it makes
 
06:03:45.510 --> 06:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
housing affordability worse not better
 
06:03:47.230 --> 06:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
the current housing affordability crisis
 
06:03:49.548 --> 06:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
is a man-made problem with its roots in
 
06:03:52.270 --> 06:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
local zoning and nimi opposition the
 
06:03:53.708 --> 06:03:53.718 align:start position:0%
problem has been growing for many years
 
06:03:56.590 --> 06:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
and even decades study after study shows
 
06:03:58.788 --> 06:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
us that restri Ive zoning is the culprit
 
06:04:00.750 --> 06:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
and all of the leading thinkers on this
 
06:04:04.190 --> 06:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
today would agree the passage of 1362
 
06:04:06.430 --> 06:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
would cause developers like myself of
 
06:04:08.430 --> 06:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
multif family housing to avoid those
 
06:04:10.070 --> 06:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities where rent controls are
 
06:04:12.708 --> 06:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
enacted further exacerbating the problem
 
06:04:14.510 --> 06:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
of supply and affordability these
 
06:04:16.270 --> 06:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
ordinance could be used by
 
06:04:18.190 --> 06:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities and NIMBY Town planners
 
06:04:19.830 --> 06:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
to further restrict development their
 
06:04:22.990 --> 06:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
communities simply by enacting the
 
06:04:25.110 --> 06:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
ordinances which are unfavorable to
 
06:04:27.590 --> 06:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
development of housing I personally we
 
06:04:29.110 --> 06:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
would not do business in a community
 
06:04:31.590 --> 06:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
where we we didn't have the some sense
 
06:04:34.788 --> 06:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
of certainty and Security in knowing um
 
06:04:36.468 --> 06:04:36.478 align:start position:0%
how we could project
 
06:04:39.190 --> 06:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
our our excuse me our budgets you know
 
06:04:40.708 --> 06:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
10 years out for
 
06:04:44.468 --> 06:04:44.478 align:start position:0%
example large rent excuse me large rent
 
06:04:46.190 --> 06:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
increases over the past few years were
 
06:04:48.910 --> 06:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
caused by tightening Supply exacerbated
 
06:04:51.270 --> 06:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
by covid-19 and rising cost to Property
 
06:04:54.390 --> 06:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
Owners we have experienced 40% increases
 
06:04:57.468 --> 06:04:57.478 align:start position:0%
in taxes 30% increases in insurance and
 
06:05:00.070 --> 06:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
utility costs and similar increases in
 
06:05:02.430 --> 06:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
the cost of labor materials during this
 
06:05:05.190 --> 06:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
period as a member of Governor uh
 
06:05:06.788 --> 06:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
Governor senuna housing stability
 
06:05:08.868 --> 06:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
Council I have have the opportunity to
 
06:05:10.548 --> 06:05:10.558 align:start position:0%
work with stakeholders from across New
 
06:05:13.110 --> 06:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and can testify that there are
 
06:05:14.868 --> 06:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
good and effective Solutions being
 
06:05:16.430 --> 06:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
discussed and implemented here in New
 
06:05:18.708 --> 06:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that all stakeholders agree
 
06:05:21.150 --> 06:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
are the right Solutions these include

Sherman thank you Mr chair members of
 
06:06:11.708 --> 06:06:11.718 align:start position:0%
the committee my name's Phil Sherman my
 
06:06:14.070 --> 06:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
wife and I own 10 rental units
 
06:06:16.670 --> 06:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
condominiums in Lebanon I speak in
 
06:06:19.468 --> 06:06:19.478 align:start position:0%
respectful opposition to this bill we
 
06:06:22.110 --> 06:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
provide housing for a grand total of 14
 
06:06:24.830 --> 06:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
people but they like their house the
 
06:06:26.430 --> 06:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
income from our rental properties
 
06:06:28.430 --> 06:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
provides a fair amount of our retirement
 
06:06:31.390 --> 06:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
income a minimum yearly rate increase of
 
06:06:34.510 --> 06:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
5% plus inflation actually
 
06:06:37.030 --> 06:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
exceeds the average our average
 
06:06:39.548 --> 06:06:39.558 align:start position:0%
year-to-year rate increase over the 34
 
06:06:42.270 --> 06:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
years as we've picked up units along the
 
06:06:45.708 --> 06:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
way however what could go wrong we
 
06:06:49.310 --> 06:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
frequently have tenants that are medical
 
06:06:51.310 --> 06:06:51.320 align:start position:0%
residents they come to Dartmouth
 
06:06:53.270 --> 06:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock for three or four years of
 
06:06:55.990 --> 06:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
indentured servitude making a median
 
06:06:59.670 --> 06:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
salary of about $62,000 a year most of
 
06:07:01.750 --> 06:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
the time we hold their rent flat for the
 
06:07:03.628 --> 06:07:03.638 align:start position:0%
time they're tenants so for three or
 
06:07:05.868 --> 06:07:05.878 align:start position:0%
four years we just leave it alone then
 
06:07:09.190 --> 06:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
we raise it for the next tenant it bumps
 
06:07:11.110 --> 06:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
having the government decide what is a
 
06:07:13.510 --> 06:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
fair return on investment Miss is
 
06:07:16.788 --> 06:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
reality rents for many of those 34 years
 
06:07:18.948 --> 06:07:18.958 align:start position:0%
were essentially
 
06:07:21.868 --> 06:07:21.878 align:start position:0%
flat we beat inflation by about a
 
06:07:23.670 --> 06:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
percent and a half if you look at it
 
06:07:25.910 --> 06:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
over the over the long
 
06:07:29.230 --> 06:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
term I'm neither an economist or even an
 
06:07:31.788 --> 06:07:31.798 align:start position:0%
expert on housing but as I understand it
 
06:07:34.070 --> 06:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve all transactions
 
06:07:37.190 --> 06:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
house price index is an interesting read
 
06:07:39.030 --> 06:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
as there's some correlation between
 
06:07:42.310 --> 06:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
rents and housing prices they use 1980
 
06:07:44.868 --> 06:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
as 100 on their scale New England
 
06:07:47.430 --> 06:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
overall is at 940 right now
 
06:07:50.310 --> 06:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is at 1180 New Hampshire
 
06:07:54.230 --> 06:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
is at 806 but there's more New Hampshire
 
06:07:56.430 --> 06:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
actually declined for several years
 
06:08:00.788 --> 06:08:00.798 align:start position:0%
after the 2008 recession then it went up
 
06:08:03.708 --> 06:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
steeply think of it as a hockey
 
06:08:06.390 --> 06:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
stick this bill proposes to tell the
 
06:08:08.150 --> 06:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
investor that whatever the rate of
 
06:08:11.468 --> 06:08:11.478 align:start position:0%
return was last year is deemed a fair
 
06:08:13.468 --> 06:08:13.478 align:start position:0%
return on investment if I read it
 
06:08:17.468 --> 06:08:17.478 align:start position:0%
properly our rents went up a lot in 2022
 
06:08:20.270 --> 06:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
some didn't increase at all in 2023 as
 
06:08:22.310 --> 06:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
the economy tightened and they won't
 
06:08:24.868 --> 06:08:24.878 align:start position:0%
rise much this year except for tenants
 
06:08:27.628 --> 06:08:27.638 align:start position:0%
that change but the bill seems to assume
 
06:08:29.590 --> 06:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
that everything happens the same way
 
06:08:33.150 --> 06:08:33.160 align:start position:0%
every year also some of our units are
 
06:08:36.310 --> 06:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
approaching 34 and 35 years old while
 
06:08:38.990 --> 06:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
they're fully Ser serviceable they'll
 
06:08:41.390 --> 06:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
need major kitchen and possibly bathroom
 
06:08:44.230 --> 06:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
upgrades in the next few years the only
 
06:08:46.948 --> 06:08:46.958 align:start position:0%
only reason this will be done is if we
 
06:08:48.990 --> 06:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
can get a payback in a fairly short
 
06:08:50.030 --> 06:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
number of
 
06:08:52.750 --> 06:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
years the bill proposes to treat this
 
06:08:55.270 --> 06:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
payback as though a large expense to
 
06:08:57.190 --> 06:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
renovate a kitchen is just another
 
06:08:59.910 --> 06:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
yearly cost Capp by the government's
 
06:09:01.310 --> 06:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
view of what's
 
06:09:04.430 --> 06:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
fair lastly and this was alluded to by
 
06:09:06.910 --> 06:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
others while the idea of rent control
 
06:09:08.708 --> 06:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
keeps bubbling up our friends in
 
06:09:11.150 --> 06:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts realized the Folly of this
 
06:09:13.948 --> 06:09:13.958 align:start position:0%
approach some 30 years ago and repealed
 
06:09:17.270 --> 06:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
their rent control law in 2020 three
 
06:09:20.830 --> 06:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
years ago 60% of the California voters
 
06:09:22.750 --> 06:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
rejected an expansion of their rent
 
06:09:25.390 --> 06:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
control I sympathize for our son and
 
06:09:27.310 --> 06:09:27.320 align:start position:0%
daughter-in-law who live there
 
06:09:28.948 --> 06:09:28.958 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm happy to answer any
 
06:09:31.190 --> 06:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
questions my cell phone number is on the
 
06:09:33.310 --> 06:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
red uh card there if anybody would like
 
06:09:34.430 --> 06:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
to call
 
06:09:38.350 --> 06:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
later thank you for your testimony
 
06:09:40.788 --> 06:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
06:09:41.910 --> 06:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
06:09:44.868 --> 06:09:44.878 align:start position:0%
testimony I don't have any uh I do have
 
06:09:48.548 --> 06:09:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:53.590 --> 06:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:56.788 --> 06:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
Grace just briefly Mr chair n Grace for
 
06:09:59.150 --> 06:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association uh we do
 
06:10:03.350 --> 06:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
support uh the concept we uh there was a
 
06:10:05.948 --> 06:10:05.958 align:start position:0%
case back in the 1970s where Allenstown
 
06:10:09.390 --> 06:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
attempted to implement uh rent control
 
06:10:11.150 --> 06:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
that ended up going to the Supreme Court
 
06:10:12.670 --> 06:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
which decided that they did not have the
 
06:10:15.430 --> 06:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
authority to do so we obviously support
 
06:10:18.750 --> 06:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
any effort to increase uh local control
 
06:10:20.468 --> 06:10:20.478 align:start position:0%
and local Authority I'm happy to take
 
06:10:23.628 --> 06:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
any questions the committee may
 
06:10:27.868 --> 06:10:27.878 align:start position:0%
have representative gager um so to
 
06:10:31.868 --> 06:10:31.878 align:start position:0%
clarify you see this as increasing local
 
06:10:34.830 --> 06:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
control and Authority um in
 
06:10:37.868 --> 06:10:37.878 align:start position:0%
previous iterations of similar ideas
 
06:10:37.878 --> 06:10:39.868 align:start position:0%
previous iterations of similar ideas
were

06:10:39.868 --> 06:10:39.878 align:start position:0%
were
 
06:10:44.030 --> 06:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
um were painted as being restricted of
 
06:10:46.110 --> 06:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
local control so I was wondering if you
 
06:10:48.830 --> 06:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
could just kind of clarify for people
 
06:10:52.150 --> 06:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
who made that confusion how this is
 
06:10:57.270 --> 06:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
actually um a pral control type thing
 
06:10:59.310 --> 06:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
sure so the the town of Allenstown back
 
06:11:01.948 --> 06:11:01.958 align:start position:0%
in the 1970s attempted to implement rent
 
06:11:04.468 --> 06:11:04.478 align:start position:0%
control that was challenged uh when dis
 
06:11:05.868 --> 06:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
Superior Court Superior Court
 
06:11:07.628 --> 06:11:07.638 align:start position:0%
transferred the question of whether that
 
06:11:10.628 --> 06:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
Authority existed under uh New Hampshire
 
06:11:14.150 --> 06:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
law to the Supreme Court which agreed to
 
06:11:17.430 --> 06:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
take take that question up it determined
 
06:11:19.708 --> 06:11:19.718 align:start position:0%
that based under the the then existing
 
06:11:22.190 --> 06:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme which is the same as it
 
06:11:25.548 --> 06:11:25.558 align:start position:0%
is now that that Authority did not exist
 
06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
um if obviously if this were to go into
 
06:11:32.190 --> 06:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
effect it would um overrule that Supreme
 
06:11:34.910 --> 06:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
Court decision and Grant that Authority
 
06:11:38.390 --> 06:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:40.548 --> 06:11:40.558 align:start position:0%
level further
 
06:11:43.110 --> 06:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
06:11:45.670 --> 06:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
savus thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:11:49.708 --> 06:11:49.718 align:start position:0%
um n i I guess I'm confused nhma
 
06:11:50.910 --> 06:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
supports the
 
06:11:50.920 --> 06:11:52.708 align:start position:0%
supports the
bill

06:11:52.708 --> 06:11:52.718 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:11:55.910 --> 06:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
yes even though there is a Supreme Court
 
06:11:58.750 --> 06:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
ruling holding that it is not possible
 
06:12:01.590 --> 06:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
to implement the Supreme Court ruling
 
06:12:04.868 --> 06:12:04.878 align:start position:0%
was based let me back up a minute
 
06:12:06.670 --> 06:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities only have the authority
 
06:12:08.708 --> 06:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
granted to them under the Constitution
 
06:12:11.910 --> 06:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
or under uh the the
 
06:12:11.920 --> 06:12:13.830 align:start position:0%
or under uh the the
statutes

06:12:13.830 --> 06:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
06:12:17.270 --> 06:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
the town of Allenstown believed that
 
06:12:19.788 --> 06:12:19.798 align:start position:0%
they uh that they had the Authority
 
06:12:23.150 --> 06:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
Under the then existing statutes um to
 
06:12:25.708 --> 06:12:25.718 align:start position:0%
implement this type of uh local
 
06:12:25.718 --> 06:12:26.990 align:start position:0%
implement this type of uh local
regulation

06:12:26.990 --> 06:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
06:12:28.548 --> 06:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court said that's not the
 
06:12:30.390 --> 06:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
case those that Authority has not been
 
06:12:33.030 --> 06:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
granted to you by the legislature a bill
 
06:12:35.830 --> 06:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
like this would Grant municipalities
 
06:12:35.840 --> 06:12:38.110 align:start position:0%
like this would Grant municipalities
that

06:12:38.110 --> 06:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:40.868 --> 06:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
Authority further
 
06:12:43.190 --> 06:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
06:12:44.628 --> 06:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
06:12:47.430 --> 06:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
testimony okay that's all I all the pink
 
06:12:51.628 --> 06:12:51.638 align:start position:0%

people signed in in
