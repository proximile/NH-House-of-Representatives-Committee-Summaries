for making sure it was as long as
possible

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
all right regular agenda
 
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm going to talk about these
 
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
two proposals together
 
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.450 align:start position:0%
two proposals together
um

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
2022-99 and 100 both of these are
 
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
radiation safety proposals they deal
 
00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
with licensing and radiation safety
 
00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 align:start position:0%
requirements and they were previously
 
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
postponed from the November meeting
 
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
after some after some discussion by the
 
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
committee there was only one issue that
 
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
remained and that was an issue with the
 
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact statement the rule
 
00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 align:start position:0%
amendments added of requirements by
 
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 align:start position:0%
inserting a citation within the rule and
 
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 align:start position:0%
um and that was to Hep
 
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
4038 but the agency's request for fiscal
 
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
impact to the LBA didn't inform the LBA
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
that the inclusion of those requirements
 
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
would not result in a fiscal impact
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
because the regulated entities were
 
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
basically already adhering to similar
 
00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 align:start position:0%
requirements that were administratively
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
attached to as a condition on their
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
licensor by the federal government after
 
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
9 11.
 
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
the agency could not get an amended fist
 
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
because there was no they didn't meet
 
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
the statutory requirements to do so and
 
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
so after some discussion the committee
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
decided to postpone the agency requested
 
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
to postpone to January so that it could
 
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
have enough time to get together revised
 
00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:02.419 align:start position:0%
fists for both of these
 
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
which isn't something really that's um
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know in 541a but they were able to
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
get two revised faces and both of those
 
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
are in the FP meeting packet at the end
 
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 align:start position:0%
of the packet
 
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
basically the LBA states that um the
 
00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
cost if there are any would be
 
00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:24.670 align:start position:0%
cost if there are any would be
indeterminable

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
indeterminable
 
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
from additional necessary security
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
measures and but there could be some
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
benefits from securing the radioactive
 
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
materials from theft and from providing
 
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:38.060 align:start position:0%
additional protection against unintended
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
unintended radiation exposures anyway
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
way both of those two proposals have
 
00:07:47.089 --> 00:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
those the revised associated with them
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
and I have no further comments
 
00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
associated with the proposals
 
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
any questions or concern or comments
 
00:07:59.150 --> 00:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
okay do we need to hear from you agency
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
at all good morning sorry I wasn't sure
 
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:05.900 align:start position:0%

uh no I'm here I'm happy to answer any
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
questions if you have any okay
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I move approval of 22.99 is
 
00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
those in favor I opposed
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:52.860 align:start position:0%

all right let's see you probably got the
 
00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
the board of veterinary medicine is
 
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
still working on theirs do we have a
 
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
motion to postpone second
 
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
any discussion on this this does not
 
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
need a waiver because we're postponing
 
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:17.580 align:start position:0%

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:21.420 align:start position:0%

aye
 
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.009 align:start position:0%
aye
opposed

00:09:25.009 --> 00:09:25.019 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:09:25.019 --> 00:09:26.690 align:start position:0%
opposed
okay

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that's postponed
 
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice
 
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
this is a new one
 
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
thank you these are the uh justice 1600
 
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
procedures for pharmaceutical drug
 
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
collection and Disposal program uh
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
currently there are five substantive
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
comments that remain on this particular
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
proposal the note to jail car on page
 
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
seven the agency did submit the rest of
 
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
their incorporation by reference
 
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
statements so that no longer applies
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
but the first substantive comment
 
00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.220 align:start position:0%
appears on page one
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
this is a definition where there is a
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
requirement which is not in compliance
 
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
with the manual so therefore has to be
 
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.850 align:start position:0%
with the manual so therefore has to be
reworded

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
reworded
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
the second substitute comment if it's
 
00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
rewording isn't that an editorial
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
comment the reason we had it as an
 
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
unclear editorial comment is because
 
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
this same comment was made on the
 
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
initial proposal and the agency did not
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
change it so we did have concerns that
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
there was a reason that it wasn't
 
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.350 align:start position:0%
there was a reason that it wasn't
changed

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
the next substantive comment appears on
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
page two and page three of the rule the
 
00:10:36.839 --> 00:10:38.030 align:start position:0%
page two and page three of the rule the
agency

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
states that the
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer who is proposing
 
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
to have uh a Take Back event or a
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
permanent box needs to get permission
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
from the DEA and they cite to a federal
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
rule however that rule simply lays out
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
when this may happen and gives the
 
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
states the ability to do it it does not
 
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
state that the agency or the excuse me
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement officer needs the
 
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
authorization of the DEA to do so
 
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
so there was an unclear comment on why
 
00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:15.779 align:start position:0%
authorization is required from the daa
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
what particular statute or rule
 
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
requires that as staff could not find
 
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
that particular statute or Rule and
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
additionally what that authorization
 
00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:29.579 align:start position:0%
will entail which ties into the unclear
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
comment on page five the section for
 
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
waiver requests it's unclear because if
 
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.050 align:start position:0%
waiver requests it's unclear because if
the

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:38.339 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer can waive a
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
request of the rule that calls them to
 
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
question whether or not that will affect
 
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
the authorization from the DEA yes the
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
final comment I'd like to hear from the
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
agency about this one because
 
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.670 align:start position:0%
agency about this one because
foreign

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Matthew Brodhead
 
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
here on I'm a senior Assistant Attorney
 
00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
General I'm here on behalf of the
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
Attorney General this is a re-adoption
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
of the rules that have been existence
 
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
for 10 years
 
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
um with minor changes from stakeholders
 
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
uh law in the law enforcement Community
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
um I'll just if I could take those
 
00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:14.459 align:start position:0%
comments just one at a time the initial
 
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
proposed rule as filed did not contain a
 
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:17.990 align:start position:0%
proposed rule as filed did not contain a
comment

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the definition I have
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
the copy of the initial proposals here
 
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
so the addition of the edit unclear with
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
respect to the definition of inner
 
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
lining is actually raised at the first
 
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
time in the final proposed text
 
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
um and that the if I might just explain
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
why it's worded that way this was a
 
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
comment actually from the uh then
 
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
outgoing police chief in the town of
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
Windham he had mentioned that there are
 
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
certain law enforcement officers that do
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
the best that they can in these drug
 
00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
take back collection events but they
 
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily we collect them in
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
inner Linings they're consistent with
 
00:12:58.569 --> 00:12:58.579 align:start position:0%
the DEA requirements so this definition
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
is uh nearly verbatim with the DEA
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
definition for drug take-back events and
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
so the reason why we just asked the
 
00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:09.899 align:start position:0%
committee to adopt it as written would
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
be because we don't want to create
 
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
differing standards between the DEA
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
regulations and the state regulations it
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
would create unnecessary confusion
 
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
um and excuse me so this is the first
 
00:13:24.889 --> 00:13:24.899 align:start position:0%
requirement that there be an inner
 
00:13:24.899 --> 00:13:25.810 align:start position:0%
requirement that there be an inner
lining

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:25.820 align:start position:0%
lining
 
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
this is a change in uh from the uh old
 
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
rule to the current rule the inner
 
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.670 align:start position:0%
rule to the current rule the inner
lining

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
lining
 
00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
um provides what law enforcement
 
00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
officers when they take evidence into
 
00:13:42.769 --> 00:13:42.779 align:start position:0%
you know of a crime they have a sealed
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
evidence bag that's logged and you can
 
00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:47.459 align:start position:0%
track if it's ever been tampered with
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
who's had access to it
 
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
um what this inner lining does is it
 
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
creates an industry standard just like
 
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.210 align:start position:0%
creates an industry standard just like
pharmaceutical

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:55.220 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical
 
00:13:59.949 --> 00:13:59.959 align:start position:0%
agencies uh you know CVS or your
 
00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
standard drug take back locations it
 
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
brings them in line to that process so
 
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
that they're not just placing uh during
 
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
drug collection events uh unwanted
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
opioids into a trash bag that's then
 
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
stored on a shelf for a while so it does
 
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
create that level of um you know brings
 
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
it in line to evidence until it's
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
destroyed so this is a new requirement
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
on local uh communities that are chewed
 
00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:27.959 align:start position:0%
using to have take back
 
00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
it's a new requirement for those
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
communities who opt into it it's not a
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
mandatory program and the reason why the
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
waivers exist is for those communities
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
that are not able to comply for whatever
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
reason these bags are on retail for
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
Amazon for about ten dollars for a a
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
dozen or so
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
um and uh but yes it is a requirement
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
for those
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
single day take back events and for the
 
00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.949 align:start position:0%
single day take back events and for the
Standalone

00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
Standalone
 
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
and again this is an opt-in program so
 
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
communities can choose to do it so we're
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
not unfortunately going to do mandate on
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
them that if they want to do that they
 
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
have to accept that this is part of the
 
00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:14.660 align:start position:0%
process that's correct and I've got
 
00:15:17.569 --> 00:15:17.579 align:start position:0%
statistics from the DEA actually that
 
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
were um that are from 2021 and there are
 
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
as the committee knows there are over
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
300 communities not in in the state of
 
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but not all have their own
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
police departments but
 
00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:32.339 align:start position:0%
um total law enforcement in the state of
 
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is among the highest as
 
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
percentage of law enforcement population
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
we have 125 communities that took that
 
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
place and Drug take back days
 
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
um there's 128 locations for those uh
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
drug take back uh programs and in one
 
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
year New Hampshire has collected over
 
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
ten thousand pounds of uh of uh opioid
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
um and that was the 2021 since the
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
adoption of this Rule and our
 
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
participation in the program New
 
00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:09.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has collected over 192 000
 
00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
pounds of illegal or expired
 
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs so this has been
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
heavily utilized in the community
 
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the comment so
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Pierre you were
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
discussing a moment ago that not all
 
00:16:34.129 --> 00:16:34.139 align:start position:0%
communities in New Hampshire have police
 
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
departments and I know that there are
 
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
some that where the state police
 
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
basically provides law enforcement what
 
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
if one of those communities wishes to uh
 
00:16:47.889 --> 00:16:47.899 align:start position:0%
to take part in this program
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
do they uh how would they do that do
 
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
they just ask the state police and is
 
00:16:56.569 --> 00:16:56.579 align:start position:0%
there some kind of an issue if if the
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
state police are are doing it because
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
they have a kind of a much larger range
 
00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:03.669 align:start position:0%
they have a kind of a much larger range
of

00:17:03.669 --> 00:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:06.839 align:start position:0%
Duty and Authority as well so could you
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
speak to that thank you representative
 
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question State
 
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
Police has uh primary jurisdiction in
 
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
those communities that are under 3500 I
 
00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
believe is the number it might be four
 
00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:19.010 align:start position:0%
believe is the number it might be four
thousand

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
um and um in those communities that
 
00:17:24.289 --> 00:17:24.299 align:start position:0%
where the select board wants to partake
 
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:26.459 align:start position:0%
in a drug take-back program and they are
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
able to utilize the resources at state
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
police and they would and state police
 
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
would provide a trooper for those
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
one-day uh take back programs it's
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
always an option for those communities
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
to reach out to the colonel or to the
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
troop commander in their area where
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to arrange for that to
 
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.370 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to arrange for that to
happen

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and if I could just respond to
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
that very quickly yes represent
 
00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
um first off I apologize about the
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
comment with the IP
 
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.450 align:start position:0%
comment with the IP
um

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
and then secondly the reason that it's
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
an unclear is because if you are
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
planning on keeping that requirement it
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
will need to be placed somewhere else in
 
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
the rule we're not saying that it has to
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
be taken out it just cannot be in a
 
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
definition as that goes against the
 
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
manual looking at the rule if you want
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
to have the inner lining
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
requirement for permanent and for take
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
back programs those could be moved down
 
00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:24.980 align:start position:0%
further in the rules specifically to
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
1603.01 for the permanent boxes just
 
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
throwing that in as a requirement and
 
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
then additionally
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
for 1604.02 just once again adding a
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
another paragraph to just have that
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
requirement in there instead of in the
 
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.710 align:start position:0%
requirement in there instead of in the
definition

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
fine so so I think that that would be a
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
simple way to do it is to Simply move it
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
to what is a more appropriate place to
 
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
put that requirement is that agreeable
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
I can look at that I I
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
the reason why I push back slightly and
 
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
I I granted the rules on the rules are
 
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.510 align:start position:0%
I I granted the rules on the rules are
clear

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
um I asked for an exception in this
 
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
instance just simply because the law
 
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
enforcement Community has a lot to
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
shoulder and when they look up the
 
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
definition of inner lining at the DEA
 
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
under the federal regulations they're
 
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
going to see these requirements that are
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
in the definition and that it needs to
 
00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:22.940 align:start position:0%
be capable of being sealed immediately
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
I think it's more efficient frankly to
 
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
have the definition leave it the way it
 
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.590 align:start position:0%
have the definition leave it the way it
is

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
understanding that you know we're not
 
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.679 --> 00:19:38.350 align:start position:0%
 
pigeonholing

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
pigeonholing
 
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
or shoe warning a whatever the right
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
idiom is
 
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
um to into the definition uh you know
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to pull anything
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
um on it but
 
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
um by and large the community in the law
 
00:19:51.529 --> 00:19:51.539 align:start position:0%
enforcement Community understands what
 
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
an inner lining is and that it requires
 
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
it to be sealed similar to an Evidence
 
00:19:57.409 --> 00:19:57.419 align:start position:0%
jury bag
 
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
um okay but yeah I've obviously deferred
 
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
to the committee on that
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
um just uh in terms of the comment on
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
page two and then the subsequent
 
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
comments to throughout initially our
 
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
initial proposed rule did not have the
 
00:20:15.529 --> 00:20:15.539 align:start position:0%
CFR reference we provided the CFR
 
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
reference in response to a comment on
 
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
our initial proposed rule that said you
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
know insert the CFR so we did insert the
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
CFR it's actually it could be improved
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
by saying it's the chapter it's 21 CFR
 
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
chapter 1317. the reason is that you
 
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
have to register the location of every
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
collection uh take back program with the
 
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
DEA they need to certify that there is a
 
00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:45.059 align:start position:0%
in fact a location
 
00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
um that where these events are occurring
 
00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
or where the Dropbox is occurring and
 
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
that's not there's not it's not cited at
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
any particular point in the CFR so I
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
could not provide a particular CFR where
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
that is but it hinges on the definition
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
of registered location and it hinges on
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
a couple different areas where law
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
enforcement has the authority to to
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
participate in these take back locations
 
00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
00:21:15.529 --> 00:21:15.539 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so you reference
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
drop boxes so would there be
 
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which a Dropbox is is
 
00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:23.820 align:start position:0%
uh provided and there's no individual no
 
00:21:27.289 --> 00:21:27.299 align:start position:0%
law enforcement person there to monitor
 
00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:30.059 align:start position:0%
or in in other words somebody could come
 
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
and not only
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
drop off but also but potentially take
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
that is that is a possibility that the
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
Dropbox will be unattended yes and
 
00:21:42.049 --> 00:21:42.059 align:start position:0%
they've they've um accounted for that
 
00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
because the rules for Dropbox are much
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
more dropboxes are much more strict they
 
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
need to be located on the premises of
 
00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
the actual police station or the law
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement location it needs to be
 
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
under video surveillance there are
 
00:22:00.649 --> 00:22:00.659 align:start position:0%
um uh certain bolting mechanisms the
 
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
actual canister itself can't be tampered
 
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
with or accessed
 
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
these have been for the communities that
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
can that have the resources to to
 
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:13.700 align:start position:0%
support these drop boxes
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
they are uh
 
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
very effective because people who may
 
00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
have an addiction problem don't
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily feel safe enough to go and
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
face a law enforcement officer face to
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
face to admit that and so having those
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
locations where they could be dropped
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
off anonymously is an important resource
 
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
to the community well thank you for that
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
clarification that really helps to
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
understand how it works thank you
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
peace if I I have a question if
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
do we understand you correctly say that
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
clear definition in the federal rules as
 
00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
to how they would reply to a request or
 
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
um no the the written authorization
 
00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:08.950 align:start position:0%
um no the the written authorization
piece

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
piece
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
just is a review on the part of the DEA
 
00:23:14.289 --> 00:23:14.299 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the location
 
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
requirements satisfy the DEA rules
 
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
for either drop boxes or one day take
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
back events
 
00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
um so how do they get back to the New
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
to officer making this request
 
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
how do they contact them yeah I mean how
 
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
it sounds from what you say it sounds as
 
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:35.990 align:start position:0%
it sounds from what you say it sounds as
though

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.850 align:start position:0%
though
police

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
request this approval or notify the DEA
 
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
and then they can't do anything until
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
they receive authorization
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
how is that authorization provided
 
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I don't know the
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
specifics whether it's a phone call or
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's a written correspondence
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
back I'm happy to find that answer out I
 
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:02.700 align:start position:0%
I don't know the mechanism for how they
 
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
give the feedback to the location I hope
 
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
it's not a phone call because our our
 
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
rule specifically says written
 
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
authorization so
 
00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.529 align:start position:0%
authorization so
um

00:24:15.529 --> 00:24:15.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know I don't know how they
 
00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:21.059 align:start position:0%
do it but uh you think that that that's
 
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
an acceptable thing to to have in our
 
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
requirements I do
 
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
and here's kind of this is a that that
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
provision has been in for the last 10
 
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
years we had a robust reach out this is
 
00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:36.539 align:start position:0%
a joint rule making Authority with the
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh the department of safety uh the
 
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:43.980 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical board we've reached
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
out to all stakeholders on this we
 
00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:47.900 align:start position:0%
reached out to the chiefs of Police
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
Association Chief Becky provided
 
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
feedback that this is a program that's
 
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
working it's well understood in the
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
community and that particular
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
authorization requirement when we had
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
our public comment period was not
 
00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to hear that
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
any other questions before we go on to
 
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
the last comment is an unclear comment
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
on page six of the rules
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
um this section lays out an alternative
 
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.390 align:start position:0%
um this section lays out an alternative
procedure

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.830 align:start position:0%
procedure
for

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:27.500 align:start position:0%
having a take back program
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
this comment was also made when these
 
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
rules came before the committee back in
 
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
2012 they were adopted with this
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
particular part included however we make
 
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
the comment again that
 
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
if there is already a procedure to waive
 
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
the rules what is the need for an
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
alternate procedure and additionally
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
back to the comment with regard to the
 
00:25:51.169 --> 00:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
waiver how would that affect the
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you so I was able to pull the
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
letter that was addressed from the then
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
administrative rules director uh who
 
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
oversaw this process with the original
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
car approval and that section 1608 was
 
00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:14.900 align:start position:0%
originally titled exemptions
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
and the jail car comment was to change
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
that heading to Alternative procedures
 
00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.870 align:start position:0%
that heading to Alternative procedures
it

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
there there's two programs that are
 
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
authorized by the DEA
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
um excuse me one program with two
 
00:26:33.649 --> 00:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and that is uh what we've
 
00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
adopted here it gives the maximum amount
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
of flexibility to the local communities
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
that can't maintain a permanent Dropbox
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
that it gives them the opportunity to
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
have these one day take back collection
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
events which is what you see in 1608 it
 
00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
is by far and large the most preferred
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
option by the local communities and the
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
rule to the extent there's
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of the the statute
 
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
what it says is that it authorizes the
 
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and these in
 
00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
conjunction with these other agencies to
 
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
adopt rules to clarify what programs
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
would be available and we've outlined
 
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
two non-mutually exclusive programs an
 
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
agency can set up a Dropbox and they can
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
also have a take back program uh it
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
gives maximum flexibility to the
 
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.669 align:start position:0%
gives maximum flexibility to the
communities

00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
so the alternative is actually in the D
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
the federal rules and so we're complying
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
with one section or the other
 
00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
correct the um the rule is uh 21 CFR 13
 
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
17.35 and it authorizes specifically for
 
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers to engage in
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
take back events
 
00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
or collection receptacles located inside
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
law enforcement's physical address okay
 
00:27:53.159 --> 00:27:56.049 align:start position:0%
law enforcement's physical address okay
so

00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:56.059 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:59.090 --> 00:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
yeah that might seems clear to me any
 
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
other questions comments yes
 
00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you madam
 
00:28:03.659 --> 00:28:04.370 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you madam
chair

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:28:06.289 --> 00:28:06.299 align:start position:0%
um it appears to me that there's also
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
the one-time um one-time procedures in
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
that has the it's titled periodic or
 
00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
one-time pharmaceutical drug take-back
 
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
events yes so to the extent that there's
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
the program that's been established and
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
say there's uh you know uh shortage a
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
lot of law enforcement communities this
 
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
is a good example are experiencing a
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
shortage of officers so to the extent
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
that they still want to participate in a
 
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
community Take Back event and that they
 
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
can't have two officers present for the
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
actual Take Back event at all times they
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
can request a waiver at the doj to uh
 
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
uh you know wave that one that
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
two-person requirement
 
00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.789 align:start position:0%
two-person requirement
um

00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
what would be helpful is with this Inner
 
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
Line lining uh addition is that it would
 
00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
actually enable uh uh more communities
 
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
to have one person because it would
 
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
double uh secure whatever uh drugs are
 
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
taken back to the extent that there's a
 
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
tamper-proof inner lining with one
 
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
officer that doubly that then make sure
 
00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
that there's uh no foul play that could
 
00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:28.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:30.409 --> 00:29:30.419 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
um so it has the normal procedure with
 
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
two officers in 1604 which then would
 
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
need a waiver which is 1607 and then is
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
1608 an entirely different alternative
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
that doesn't require a waiver in order
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
to fit into that one officer and
 
00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
tamper-proof liner
 
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
see I'm sorry say that one more time so
 
00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
the standard Community take back day is
 
00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
1604 and you said they may need a waiver
 
00:29:57.769 --> 00:29:57.779 align:start position:0%
which is 1607.
 
00:29:59.450 --> 00:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
and then we have the alternative
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
procedure at 1608 is 1608 just codifying
 
00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
one of those differences with the one
 
00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't think I understand
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
your your question can you say it one
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
more time
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
we have one day take back some 1604
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
which can have a waiver through 1607.
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
um then then I don't know if that would
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
handle your one officer or if that's
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
just a separate codification of it I'm
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so to uh to confuse you yes so
 
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.130 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so to uh to confuse you yes so
um

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.490 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:44.169 --> 00:30:44.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
procedure is are those entities that are
 
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.330 align:start position:0%
procedure is are those entities that are
providing

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
providing
 
00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.710 align:start position:0%
providing
um

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh that are solely governed by the DEA
 
00:30:57.649 --> 00:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
procedure and where there's preemption
 
00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:00.539 align:start position:0%
so that and that's my fault and I'm
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
sorry to cause confusion so where there
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
where there is an entity uh or a law
 
00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer that is specifically
 
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
designated by the DEA to conduct at the
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
request of the federal government
 
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
through their own Federal delegation
 
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
these rules are generally not applicable
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
anyways they'd be preempted but what
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
this provides is that is if you're
 
00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
acting pursuant to a DEA Authority that
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
to follow the federal mandates
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry for the confusion there thank
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
you for that clarification thank you
 
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
that is not clear that
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
the because it looks it looked to me
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
like you've got
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know two percent the standard the
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
one at a time procedure and then the
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
with waiver options and then you have a
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
totally separate thing right and I think
 
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
that's why it was originally titled as
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
an exemption and not alternative
 
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.450 align:start position:0%
an exemption and not alternative
procedure

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
um when the jail car originally was
 
00:32:00.529 --> 00:32:00.539 align:start position:0%
presented with this rule it was it there
 
00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:03.860 align:start position:0%
was so this was different completely so
 
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
1608 is an alternative procedure for
 
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
essentially non-law enforcement entities
 
00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
no it's for law enforcement entities
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
that are designated by the DEA to to act
 
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
I think that that should be indicated
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere that it is specific there are
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
only specific law enforcement agencies
 
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919 align:start position:0%
that can use this because this reads
 
00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:36.350 align:start position:0%
that can use this because this reads
like

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.970 align:start position:0%
like
um

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
you know if my town decides to set one
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
up they could use this procedure and
 
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
apparently they can't because I'm sure
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
we're not on the list of specific
 
00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:48.539 align:start position:0%
authorizations happy to clarify that
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I think the title would
 
00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:54.299 align:start position:0%
be the place to put it
 
00:32:57.289 --> 00:32:57.299 align:start position:0%
any other questions Madam chair Brokers
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
on the Block Senator that's fine
 
00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:01.799 align:start position:0%
um so two things
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
um I I am too also confused by three
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
different programs that are that are
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
listed and who is responsible for which
 
00:33:09.409 --> 00:33:09.419 align:start position:0%
one and who's eligible to use which one
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
but I am not unclear on the inner lining
 
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
conversation I guess I just want to just
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
go back to that first conversation point
 
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
we had about inner Linings because if
 
00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:18.980 align:start position:0%
you look at the definition right above
 
00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:21.419 align:start position:0%
inner Linings it's a def it's a Dropbox
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
and dropbox says it has to have an inner
 
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
lining and then the next one is just a
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
definition of when inner lining is so
 
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
they know what has to go in there so
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
they don't use a Shaw's bag right so I
 
00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:32.519 align:start position:0%
guess that's the best way I can say is
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm okay with the definitions as
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
they are it just cleans up exactly
 
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
what's in the definition above that says
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
a Dropbox has to have it in her bag and
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
then their bag is and it tells it what
 
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
an inner bag is so agreed right
 
00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.370 align:start position:0%
an inner bag is so agreed right
okay

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.610 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
so I is there any other question any
 
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
other comments discussions questions
 
00:33:59.289 --> 00:33:59.299 align:start position:0%
no no
 
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:03.419 align:start position:0%
in that case I think I will move move to
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
approve conditionally that
 
00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:09.260 align:start position:0%
the heading for
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
Justice 1608 specify that is only for
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
previously approved law enforcement
 
00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:18.419 align:start position:0%
agencies or something
 
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
for specific law enforcement agencies
 
00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
designated by the DEA
 
00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:26.690 align:start position:0%
designated by the DEA
second

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
okay those in favor hi
 
00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:33.899 align:start position:0%
those opposed
 
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:41.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
Board of Education Board of Education
 
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
um so I'm looking at the conditional
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
approval for 2022 138
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
on page two all the page numbers say one
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
but there's only three pages so
 
00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:58.310 align:start position:0%
but there's only three pages so
um

00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:01.460 align:start position:0%
and so I'm looking at a Ed
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
150105 paragraph C
 
00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
um so this is the only issue and it and
 
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.140 align:start position:0%
um the paragraph reads if the department
 
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
finds the Innovation plan performance is
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
not improving at a sufficient rate
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
um so these are Innovation schools they
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
they come up with a plan and then the
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
Board of Education evaluates
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
um their progress
 
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
but improving at a sufficient rate is I
 
00:35:31.849 --> 00:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
mean it lacks criteria it's you know
 
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
it's not clear enough for a person to
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
actually know what they need to do
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
um the second half of of what they added
 
00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:41.339 align:start position:0%
there you know or that the plan is not
 
00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
achieving the planned results is a
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
that has that's a criteria
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
um so you would know what you need to do
 
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
to make that happen but improving at a
 
00:35:55.609 --> 00:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
sufficient rate just isn't clear enough
 
00:35:55.619 --> 00:36:00.589 align:start position:0%
sufficient rate just isn't clear enough
so

00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
and I believe you're the department
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
ready to explain this to us hi good
 
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.630 align:start position:0%
ready to explain this to us hi good
morning

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
um Julie Shea Department of Education
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
um administrative rules coordinator
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
um hi I'm Elizabeth Brown I'm Council
 
00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
we we are um
 
00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
happy to remove improving at a
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
sufficient rate so that it simply says
 
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:28.140 align:start position:0%
is not achieving the planned results
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
um that is covered in The Innovation
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
plan and that way
 
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
um there's no gray area of what a
 
00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:35.339 align:start position:0%
sufficient rate is we don't want to
 
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
Define what a sufficient rate is because
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
the local school boards are the ones
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
that should be reviewing these plans and
 
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
that would work okay
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you that's uh
 
00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
move to approve as edited thank you
 
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
if those in favor
 
00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:58.790 align:start position:0%
if those in favor
aye

00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
aye
 
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.290 align:start position:0%
aye
opposed

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much excellent thank
 
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.910 align:start position:0%
 
insurance

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
so this is 2022 163 on procedures and
 
00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:17.579 align:start position:0%
adjusters the agency did file a
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request which
 
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
removed all but two comments
 
00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
the first comment has appears on page
 
00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:29.579 align:start position:0%
two of the rule the agency uses May
 
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
instead of shall
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
the agency had responded that this was
 
00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:37.140 align:start position:0%
part of the model rule language and
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
therefore makes them exempt from having
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
to use the shell however in a
 
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
conversation with the agency's attorney
 
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
just now it seems there was a bit of a
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
miscommunication that language was
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
actually pulled from guidance not the
 
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
actual model rules so therefore our
 
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
comment would stand that this needs to
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.839 --> 00:38:00.650 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Heather Silverstein
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
general counsel at the New Hampshire
 
00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
insurance department uh yes there was a
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
disconnect at my agency as far as model
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
rules and laws from the neic the
 
00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:13.740 align:start position:0%
National Association of insurance
 
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
Commissioners as opposed to guidelines
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I did have a discussion with Rebecca
 
00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
before this and we'd be it would be fine
 
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
to have shell instead of May so we can
 
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
change it okay thank you I'm chair move
 
00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
to prove as edited okay any discussion
 
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
I apologize I would draw my motion
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
trying to get this done so I didn't see
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
in a second I I thought that we allowed
 
00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:44.579 align:start position:0%
the insurance department to follow
 
00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
guidelines as well as model rules
 
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
I believe the exemption only is for the
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
model rules as opposed to the guidance
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
and just to be completely accurate this
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
is a handbook that came out from the
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
neic related to producer licensing so
 
00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
um when I looked further down and had
 
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:12.020 align:start position:0%
the discussion with Rebecca my concerns
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
are alleviated I'm fine with shell hey
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:22.140 align:start position:0%
the second substantive comment which is
 
00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
found on page
 
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
four of the rule
 
00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:28.700 align:start position:0%
um I also had a conversation
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
with Heather about this one as well
 
00:39:35.569 --> 00:39:35.579 align:start position:0%
um the comment was not to remove the
 
00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:38.099 align:start position:0%
citation for the statute but rather to
 
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
also include what the agency's
 
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
procedures are in determining what
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
penalty shall be given for whatever
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
action we understand it is factually
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
based but our suggestion was to just
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
cite to the insurance 200 rules which is
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
their adjudicative process to which it
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
sounds as though the agency is in
 
00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:01.619 align:start position:0%
agreement with that
 
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
yeah so so
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
um having the conversation with Rebecca
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
um I would be fine I thought she wanted
 
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
us to remove the penalty statute
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
altogether which we do not want to do
 
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
um because we always defer to that in
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
our rules it's consistent and if that
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
statute ever changed we we just change
 
00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
as a statute changes uh the rule changes
 
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
um so I would be amenable to adding
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
um uh an ins 200 as that applies and and
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
the reason I would like that
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
qualification is because
 
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
um it applies when there's a hearing and
 
00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
so there could be a scenario where
 
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
there's no hearing and and as an example
 
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
of that let's say the producer uh
 
00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
doesn't renew
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
um because they don't the license is not
 
00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
removed because renewed because they
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
don't meet the educational requirements
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
but then they don't sell and then they
 
00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
go go get their educational requirements
 
00:40:58.970 --> 00:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
and then they submit that which is what
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
this rule is saying once you submit that
 
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
and you're in compliance then you're
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
fine the other scenario is a producer
 
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't renew doesn't meet the
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
educational requirements and keeps on
 
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
selling even though their license isn't
 
00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
renewed that would trigger us to look
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
further into it and then that would end
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
up in administrative hearing and so
 
00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
that's why I would rather have an ins
 
00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:25.619 align:start position:0%
200 as that applies
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I think that's clear any other
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
comments no further comments
 
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:33.300 align:start position:0%

any further discussion comments
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
seeing none those in favor
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
aye opposed all right thank you very
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay oplc natural scientists
 
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
so the only issue with this rule is that
 
00:41:59.230 --> 00:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
um it some of it would uh excuse me
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
expired in March of 2019 and some of
 
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
those rules included display
 
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
disciplinary sanctions and
 
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
administrative fees and
 
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
some other things so you may have some
 
00:42:17.569 --> 00:42:17.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning
 
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair members of the committee
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
for the record Lindsey Courtney
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
executive director office of
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
professional Ace insurance certification
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
um so I think the committee is well
 
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
aware of some of the challenges that
 
00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:34.940 align:start position:0%
oplc has faced and our task and
 
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
plan to establish internal controls
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
within the agency we recently in
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
addition to
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
um coming up with a plan to ensure that
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
rules are not expiring which this is the
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
result of that
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
inventory that we conducted we also
 
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
inventoried all of the existing fees and
 
00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:58.140 align:start position:0%
preparation for filing that you should
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
be seeing shortly to memorialize all
 
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
existing fees in one filing and
 
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
discovered that the fees had been
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
expired so that finding was made in
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
November so we're presently working on
 
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
the refunds that we are used to doing
 
00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.109 align:start position:0%
the refunds that we are used to doing
unfortunately

00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:43:20.569 --> 00:43:20.579 align:start position:0%
in the past with fees expiring and the
 
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
lack of internal controls in the agency
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
I do think that with the filing that we
 
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
intend to make and I know we're working
 
00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:29.339 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal impact statement right now
 
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
in the 1002s that that should remedy the
 
00:43:35.569 --> 00:43:35.579 align:start position:0%
situation and prevent it from happening
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
happy to take any additional questions
 
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's better to be clear we the rules
 
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
expired we have collected fees we're
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
returning the fees because we didn't
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
have rules and we're ready to move
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
forward correct thank you move to
 
00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.730 align:start position:0%
forward correct thank you move to
approve

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:49.740 align:start position:0%
approve
 
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
any further come is there a second sorry
 
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are there any further
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
those in favor I opposed
 
00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
and court reporters
 
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
okay so 2022-9 for court reporters is an
 
00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
interim rule
 
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
um which if adopted it will be effective
 
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
for 180 days this is on one of the
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
boards which was changed to an Advisory
 
00:44:25.609 --> 00:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
Board to the executive director of the
 
00:44:28.849 --> 00:44:28.859 align:start position:0%
oplc during the last legislative session
 
00:44:31.089 --> 00:44:31.099 align:start position:0%
there are currently effective rules
 
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
which most likely are unenforceable
 
00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:35.220 align:start position:0%
because the authority has been
 
00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
transferred so if adopted there will be
 
00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
two sets of rules effective however the
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
oplc does plan to repeal the currently
 
00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
effective rules after adoption of these
 
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.130 align:start position:0%
effective rules after adoption of these
rules

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
um besides that issue there are two
 
00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
major issues to bring to your attention
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
and there are a couple of minor ones as
 
00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.089 align:start position:0%
and there are a couple of minor ones as
well

00:44:58.089 --> 00:44:58.099 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
despite the filing of a conditional
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
approval request but those minor issues
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
can be handled during regular rule
 
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
making so for sake of time I'll just
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
discuss the two major issues the first
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
one is on page nine of the
 
00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:19.460 align:start position:0%
FP package or page three of the rule
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
there is an issue of statutory conflict
 
00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:24.300 align:start position:0%
and Authority that needs to be addressed
 
00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:29.540 align:start position:0%
by the legislature and that's at PLC
 
00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
1203.04 a
 
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
there you're going to see that the rule
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
is talking about the records of the
 
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
former board that they shall be retained
 
00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:41.220 align:start position:0%
by the executive director in accordance
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
with the retention schedule scheduled
 
00:45:47.569 --> 00:45:47.579 align:start position:0%
um established by the executive director
 
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
this language is what's in the statute
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
but there are two problems with it the
 
00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
Authority for retention of state agency
 
00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
records actually resides with the
 
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State the Department of
 
00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
State which doesn't have any rules on
 
00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
the topic so the statute is granting the
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
authority to the executive director and
 
00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
that conflicts with other statutes the
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
second issue is that just merely Excuse
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
me yes I understand you correctly that
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
the problem is not with the rule but the
 
00:46:22.849 --> 00:46:22.859 align:start position:0%
statutes partly the second part of this
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
particular section is that they're just
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
merely reciting what the statute says so
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't provide any transparency for
 
00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
how or how long or in what Manner the
 
00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
rule the records will be maintained this
 
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
issue was in another proposal I think
 
00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
recently before the committee and it was
 
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
approved but we felt like we need to
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
bring this to your attention because of
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
the staff statutory conflicts that need
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
to be resolved so that's the first major
 
00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
issue I can pause there I'd like to say
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
on that that
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
we can address the issue of lack of
 
00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
clarity and regular rulemaking in the
 
00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
statutory conflict is somewhat beyond
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
agency's control if I may also interest
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
that Madam chair I don't view it as a
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
statutory conflict the intent of the
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
statute which authorizes the executive
 
00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:20.660 align:start position:0%
director to establish a retention policy
 
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
was to make clear that the agency not
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
the boards could establish the retention
 
00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:29.660 align:start position:0%
policy in accordance with the RSA
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
setting forth the requirement that the
 
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State approve the retention
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
policy because previously all of the
 
00:47:38.089 --> 00:47:38.099 align:start position:0%
boards had their own retention policies
 
00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
and it's very difficult for an agency to
 
00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
execute 50 plus sets of retention
 
00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
policies for the same types of documents
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
we did work with the Secretary of
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
State's office I would agree that it
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
would be nice if the procedures were a
 
00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
little bit more transparent it took me
 
00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
about a year to get that that uh that
 
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
retention policy approved but we do have
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
an approved retention policy pursuant to
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's Authority so I
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
don't view it as a conflict
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
they could and they could put some kind
 
00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
of detail here you know around that
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
retention policy but again Madam chair
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
that could be done during regular
 
00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
rulemaking whether that's five years or
 
00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
however it is that they're retaining
 
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
that they could just kind of Flesh that
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
out a little bit more in the role
 
00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
or they could simply provide a reference
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
to the oplc retention policy which is
 
00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
somewhere available yes we can certainly
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
do that in regular rulemaking okay Madam
 
00:48:30.839 --> 00:48:33.470 align:start position:0%
do that in regular rulemaking okay Madam
chair

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
um in this instance most agencies will
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
specify a period of years such as four
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
years and then we'll also say unless
 
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
otherwise establish pursuant to the
 
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
rules that are supposed to be adopted by
 
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
uh State I do plan to talk with the
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State about adoption of
 
00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
those rules
 
00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
okay the second major issue is on page
 
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
18 of the final proposal package or page
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
12 of the rule you can also look at page
 
00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
three of the conditional approval
 
00:49:09.609 --> 00:49:09.619 align:start position:0%
request here at PLC
 
00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:12.839 align:start position:0%
1205.06 on documentation requirements
 
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:16.380 align:start position:0%
for audits the rule says that failure to
 
00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
submit documents when told to do so
 
00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
represents a rule violation for which
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
the executive director can take
 
00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action as provided in the
 
00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
rules and as provided in a cited statute
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
the problem is that using the phrase can
 
00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
be taken violates the rules which
 
00:49:37.609 --> 00:49:37.619 align:start position:0%
actually says later on that the
 
00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
executive director shall impose
 
00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:40.849 align:start position:0%
executive director shall impose
discipline

00:49:40.849 --> 00:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
discipline
 
00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
even if you ignore that the citation to
 
00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
the PLC 1208 doesn't really work because
 
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
that section only describes the
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
aggravating and mitigating
 
00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:55.140 align:start position:0%
factors for when determining what
 
00:49:58.210 --> 00:49:58.220 align:start position:0%
discipline shall apply it doesn't
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
outline what the executive director will
 
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
consider whenever initiating the
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
discipline Additionally the citation to
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
the RSA 310 a174 doesn't really work
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
either because there's not a catch-all
 
00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
category in the statute that would
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
directly apply it describes actions that
 
00:50:22.329 --> 00:50:22.339 align:start position:0%
would be sufficient for incurring
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
discipline missing paperwork doesn't
 
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
really fall underneath those categories
 
00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
it could possibly fall underneath
 
00:50:32.809 --> 00:50:32.819 align:start position:0%
willful or repeated violations of the
 
00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:35.460 align:start position:0%
statute that's a little bit of a stretch
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
so those are the two issues with this
 
00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.250 align:start position:0%
so those are the two issues with this
proposal

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
I don't take issue with changing hand to
 
00:50:42.839 --> 00:50:43.910 align:start position:0%
I don't take issue with changing hand to
Shell

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
Shell
 
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
um I think that the result obviously
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
would be to eliminate discretion in
 
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not to discipline
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
an individual but I I support
 
00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
I support having objective criteria and
 
00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to change it to Shell
 
00:51:00.599 --> 00:51:01.670 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to change it to Shell
the

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
references to the
 
00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:05.829 align:start position:0%
references to the
C

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
C
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
1208 and so forth can be fixed in a
 
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
regular rulemaking yes ma'am okay
 
00:51:14.569 --> 00:51:14.579 align:start position:0%
any other concerns
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
no no ma'am questions comments given the
 
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
editorial comments I moved to approve
 
00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:26.589 align:start position:0%
 
again

00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none of those in favor
 
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
Medical Imaging
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair so this rule
 
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
also was put in uh it's also an
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
intramural because the board has been
 
00:51:51.049 --> 00:51:51.059 align:start position:0%
turned into an Advisory Board under the
 
00:51:51.059 --> 00:51:53.690 align:start position:0%
turned into an Advisory Board under the
oplc

00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
the only two comments I had after the
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
oplc submitted conditional approval are
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
two that were just discussed on the
 
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
previous interim rule the issue with
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
other rules currently being in effect
 
00:52:08.569 --> 00:52:08.579 align:start position:0%
under the old board it sounds like the
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
oplc is going to repeal those after
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
these rules are put into effect and the
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
other was for the retention policy which
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
we just had a discussion about I thought
 
00:52:21.049 --> 00:52:21.059 align:start position:0%
that when we converted those boards to
 
00:52:24.049 --> 00:52:24.059 align:start position:0%
advisory we put a general statement that
 
00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:26.300 align:start position:0%
existing rules are valid until
 
00:52:30.049 --> 00:52:30.059 align:start position:0%
expired or replaced we did not
 
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
um not in all instances that has
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
occurred I plan to talk with the direct
 
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
director of the conus and some of the
 
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
bill drafters about making a little more
 
00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
uniform language uh because we've had
 
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
several instances
 
00:52:46.609 --> 00:52:46.619 align:start position:0%
especially with the boards that are
 
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
becoming advisory boards and even back
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
to when puc was split into puc and
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
energy that they're always there has not
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
always been a clear definition of what
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
rules carried over
 
00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
Etc I tried to put that in my uh oplc
 
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
organization bill that was the only
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
comment that I specifically add into it
 
00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:11.339 align:start position:0%
is that the rules apply until uh
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
repealed or expired
 
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
I take a responsibility for that one I
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
should have noticed that when these were
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
going through
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
okay well I think we would have the same
 
00:53:26.329 --> 00:53:26.339 align:start position:0%
visit editorial comments on this rule as
 
00:53:29.089 --> 00:53:29.099 align:start position:0%
the previous one and um
 
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
same intent to clarify during regular
 
00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
rulemaking so is there a motion
 
00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
moved to approved yeah
 
00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:38.460 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
Lenny recovers move to approve the
 
00:53:45.069 --> 00:53:45.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%

00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%

00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%

00:53:59.329 --> 00:53:59.339 align:start position:0%
certain uh whether it was representative
 
00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
Schmidt or representative guy in favor
 
00:54:05.089 --> 00:54:05.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
alphabetical ordering you know all right
 
00:54:10.609 --> 00:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
so that completes our
 
00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
business I think we will not have a
 
00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
Madam Madam chair I did send out an
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
email to all the members and alternates
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday indicating that because of the
 
00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
weather we would not have a orientation
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
meeting today I did send out an
 
00:54:39.049 --> 00:54:39.059 align:start position:0%
orientation packet that should cover
 
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.220 align:start position:0%
most everything but we would be happy to
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
meet with individual members or a group
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
of the members to go over that
 
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:49.380 align:start position:0%
okay I know at least one of the members
 
00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:51.740 align:start position:0%
who's watching us on Zoom or whatever
 
00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:53.650 align:start position:0%

00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
method is so maybe some of the other
 
00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
ones are as well because
 
00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
uh I I was delighted to find out that
 
00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
the roads from Dover to Concord were
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
very drivable but I looked out my window
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
this morning I thought hey
 
00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
five inches of snow and who knows but
 
00:55:18.349 --> 00:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
