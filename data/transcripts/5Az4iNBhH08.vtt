the subject parcel as uh

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
it was acquired in 1955 by commissioners

return of layout
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
and at some time in the 60s it looked
 
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
like it it basically became part of the
 
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.070 align:start position:0%
like it it basically became part of the
backyard

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
backyard
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
i was out there last week in fact the

pool
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
that was probably installed in the 60s
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
the hagmans discovered this when they
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
had their property surveyed the surveyor
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
noticed it they contacted us and they
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
want to clean up
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
their boundary lines
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
i can take any questions
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
when we when we purchased this property
 
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
what did we pay for it
 
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:31.909 align:start position:0%
what did we pay for it
uh

00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry senator i can't answer that
 
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039 align:start position:0%
right now but i certainly will get back
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
to you by email
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
and further question
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
so who
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
who made the appraisal
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
that that 10 000 covered
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
cover the value of the property
 
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
that was um that was done
 
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.430 align:start position:0%
that was um that was done
um

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
and just a little nuance to this
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if we
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
paid anything for it because
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
this was part of a road that was
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
discontinued and us as the abutters it
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
may have just reverted to us once the
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
road was discontinued
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
it was the state road uh i know that the
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
road that was discontinued i believe was
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
a class five highway or a class six
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
highway but i as i said i will make sure
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%

00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
as you just pointed out this this
 
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
property has been
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
up before the committee in the past to
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the price
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
it um
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
it was purchased in 2003 for 570
 
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that was a nine acre
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
parcel the parcel was then bisected by
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
route 111 in our construction
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here is trying to
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
market the northern
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
two acres the problem with this parcel
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
and why we haven't been able to move it
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
is because all but basically a quarter
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
of an acre is wet
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's all wetlands so there's only about
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
a quarter of an acre of property that
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
can be developed
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
so we're asking to reduce that price i
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
believe right now it's being marketed at
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
450 000
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
we're asking to reduce that to 120 000
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you i do have one question
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
what is the downside to the department
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
if we elect not to put this back on the
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
market at this point
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
good question
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
honestly i you know it'll just be
 
00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:28.069 align:start position:0%
honestly i you know it'll just be

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
or somebody comes along and asks us to
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions senator delson
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr but if it's wetlands are we
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
using it for mitigation in any sense
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
it's not it wasn't purchased from
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
mitigation and it's currently not being
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
used it's not we're not getting any
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
mitigation credit currently from it and
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
that that's a good point i can talk to
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
our bureau of environment and see if
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
there's some mitigation potential there
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
for the point for other i think that
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
might be a
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
a good idea why should we get rid of
 
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
something when we can use it when it
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
does have a
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
a use and it's also a value in the
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
ecological situation it has some value i
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
mean if we sell it they're going to fill
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
it somebody's going to ask to phil and
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to
 
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
build on it right i mean isn't that
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
isn't that what usually happens when we
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
get rid of property like this
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure about filling in the
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
wetlands but they'll develop whatever
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
my my major concern is everything like
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
annually about um we lower the price a
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
little bit um
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
so now we're
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
essentially asking to cut it
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
well over in half
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
from what we're currently trying to get
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
if there is potential for
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
mitigation or a future sale which
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
may may work out better for the state
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
i would not be opposed to turning down
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
this request but
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
that is up for the committee to decide
 
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
um not only am i the department's
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%

and i recognize the department
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning my name is craig
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
granny i'm the chief of the bureau of
 
00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
trails at the new hampshire department
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
of natural and cultural resources
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
and as stated that the iran courts
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
approach dncr about acquiring a small
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
portion of state-owned land this is on
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
the north stratford beecher falls rail
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
trail that we we manage
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
their existing property abuts route 3
 
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
and the trails on the back side of their
 
00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.390 align:start position:0%
and the trails on the back side of their
property

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
and there previously there was a large
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
garage that was on the property and
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
extended into the area
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
in question that we that we own
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
there was a small encroachment there and
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
i my understanding is the garage has
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
since burned and it's the existing
 
00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.470 align:start position:0%
since burned and it's the existing
concrete

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
concrete
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
pad that's there now so it's a little
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
over a tenth of an acre that they're
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't affect our recreation trail
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
use or management it's separated by
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
their property by a large drainage ditch
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
so it's a very narrow piece of land that
 
00:21:53.919 --> 00:21:55.430 align:start position:0%
so it's a very narrow piece of land that
abuts

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
abuts
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
their parcel as well so
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
again it's just uh requesting
 
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
authorization to convey that to them
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
i do have one
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
is there an anticipated use of this
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
piece of property yeah my understanding
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
is they're looking to redevelop the
 
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.590 align:start position:0%
is they're looking to redevelop the
property

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
into some kind of a convenience store at
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
this location
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
and again it's right off of our rail
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
trail and so it'll certainly benefit our
 
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.270 align:start position:0%
trail and so it'll certainly benefit our
riders

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
riders
 
00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.470 align:start position:0%
riders
okay

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%

today we're here looking for the

committee to approve the use of premise

agreement at the rockingham county

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
courthouse
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
this would allow admin services to lease
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
18 053 square feet of space at the
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
courthouse in the lower level to
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
rockingham county
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
for the registry of deeds and for the
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
county attorney's office

and the rental revenue covers our
 
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you questions of the committee
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
representative excuse me senator
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
hennessey thank you mr chair i just want
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
to ask about the the rental rates for
 
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.669 align:start position:0%
to ask about the the rental rates for
this

00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
we hear a lot in
 
00:25:05.679 --> 00:25:06.870 align:start position:0%
we hear a lot in
finance

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
finance
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh and sometimes in ways and means about
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
the market rates right now and what the
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
state has to pay for lease space
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
is this comparable to lease rates for
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
that the state is paying when we have to
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
go out and find extra space
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
so um that's a very good question um we
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
do have a formula on that we are to
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
follow when we determine rates
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's basically we are charged with
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
recouping our operating costs
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
and also two percent of the original
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
construction costs of the courthouse
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
so those two combined figures make up
 
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
what we charge
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
our tenants in the state-owned buildings
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
it's different than
 
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
yeah representative edwards uh thank you
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i you know i i i have
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
constituents throughout rockingham
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
county so
 
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.269 align:start position:0%
county so
um

00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
i i'd like a little bit more of the back
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
story here on on what we think is going
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
to happen over the next three years and
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
some of this is a probably more
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate address to people from
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
rockingham county but if they're if
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
they're freeing up space you know what
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
they're going to do with that space and
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
and how is it that we came upon as a
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
state having over 18 000 square feet
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
that's available did we did we over buy
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
did things change how did how did we get
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
here and where are we going sure the
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
courthouse was constructed in 1996
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
and as part of the construction process
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
the space was fit up for the county
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
so they were determined to be a tenant
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
of the state at that time of
 
00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.070 align:start position:0%
of the state at that time of
construction

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
construction
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
and so the whole lower level
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
of the courthouse that the state owns
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
is fit up
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
and the county i believe is going to be
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
building a new facility for the county
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
but it will be out several years
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%

determined that her front yard was in
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
what was formerly the public access and
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%

00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
my investigation concurred with her
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
survey that yeah that parcel is on the
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
railroad property and uh
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
it has no future use for uh railroad
 
00:29:53.549 --> 00:29:53.559 align:start position:0%
service uh road service ended there in
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
66 i think at the latest
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
and uh recommended uh that we sell this
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
property and it's here for your
 
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.350 align:start position:0%

only a portion of the and what are we
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
going to do with the rest of that piece
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
of property i'm
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
we are hoping to do the same thing
 
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
without making this too long a story uh
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
the town's ambulance building is

00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
to that date
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
at 9 30 in the morning uh same time
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
and if the
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
lba would make sure that
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
the agencies know that this will
 
00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
probably be the last meeting
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
until the september time frame
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
i do not intend to to
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
meet over the summer unless it's a
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
critical need of the state
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
for us to do something
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i know that many people will be out
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
members of the house and senate will be
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
campaigning or vacationing after
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
two years of not getting out vacationing
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
so we will not meet
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
until september
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
so if you could just let them know that
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
is there any further business from
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
members representative edwards uh thank
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
you mr chair i i don't know if there's
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
somebody from the department that could
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
help address this but um with the recent
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
vote and finance committee on
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
the parking garage um
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
35 million i think i i'm just curious
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
what the process is for the state
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
maintaining an inventory of buildings
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
so that we're anticipating major
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
costs of either
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
tearing it down like all those sununu
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
buildings i'm curious where they are in
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
the capital budget process and the
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
parking garage
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
um and then if there are major
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
renovations in a few years that we're
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
expecting on one building or another how
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
how does
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
how does this committee interact if at
 
00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.270 align:start position:0%
how does this committee interact if at
all

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
the building side of the capital budget
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
we do not
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
the capital budget is developed
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
by the governor in conjunction with all
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
the agencies and submitted to
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
public works committee of the house
 
00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.629 align:start position:0%
public works committee of the house
initially

00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
initially
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
we look at that with what the financial
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
ability of the state to bond is
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
and then goes to the senate
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
does not look at those capital projects
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
capital budget overview committee does
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
get reports
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
on what is there
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
those reports are online
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
would care to to look at them
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
services also maintains a listing
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
of all buildings that various agencies
 
00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:31.030 align:start position:0%
of all buildings that various agencies
own

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
and that is updated
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
it does not talk about
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
the physical needs of each piece of
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
property that is what the capital budget
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
process is for and there's always more
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
needs than
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
than money
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how that the the parking
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
garage will be
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
overseen since uh commissioner arlene
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
house had some questions about it
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
he was not
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
