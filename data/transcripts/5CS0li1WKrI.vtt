we had a lively hearing on House Bill
 
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 align:start position:0%
105 and as a result of
 
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
the input that we had from the hearing
 
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 align:start position:0%
it was decided that we might try to
 
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
amend the bill and went through
 
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
different iterations of it
 
00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
and I am introducing to the subcommunity
 
00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 align:start position:0%
amendment which essentially takes out
 
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 align:start position:0%

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 align:start position:0%

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
a record retention
 
00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 align:start position:0%

state and with um Department of Health
 
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 align:start position:0%
and Human Services we would like to

the summer so that we can
 
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.370 align:start position:0%
the summer so that we can
um

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259 align:start position:0%
um address similar concerns that people
 
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
have about privacy
 
00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 align:start position:0%
it was discussed there was a senate
 
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
hearing yesterday on the um on the bill
 
00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:53.539 align:start position:0%

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
the vital records from the Secretary of
 
00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
State to the Department of Health and

Human Services and it was not accepted
 
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
by the committee and it was opposed by
 
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office so
 
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.650 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office so
um

um
 
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that our constitution
 
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
says Secretary of State actually is
 
00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:15.539 align:start position:0%

about the Constitution so in New
 
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's constitution in part second
 
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
article 68 it says that the records of
 
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
the state shall be kept in the office of
 
00:07:57.529 --> 00:07:57.539 align:start position:0%

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
um this includes the vital records in
 
00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
the state and that's under uh RSA 5 C
 
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
um colon 3 the policy in the
 
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
um and state law does identify the
 
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State as The Keeper of the
 
00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:19.379 align:start position:0%

um the records of Vital Records and the
 
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
data associated with that and I also
 
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize that our our state law
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
says that we are the keepers of the
 
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
records but also while assuring the
 
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
privacy of all New Hampshire citizens so
 
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:36.419 align:start position:0%
that's the Privacy piece is something
 
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
that we take very seriously in addition
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
to the vital records of the state we are
 
00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:42.659 align:start position:0%
the keeper of all records of the state
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
this includes all the records for all
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
the um the physical records we have
 
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
over a hundred thousand boxes that we
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
keep in our division of archives and
 
00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:55.580 align:start position:0%
Records management
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
and that that number grows annually
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
um as as well as the number of
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
electronic records that we maintain for
 
00:09:05.329 --> 00:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
the state continues to grow
 
00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:06.230 align:start position:0%

I'm sorry if I'm continuing on and too
 
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
far down a rabbit path about
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
um about what the records management
 
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:15.899 align:start position:0%
that we do for the state is
 
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:18.420 align:start position:0%

with uh some of your people uh Madam
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
Secretary uh

00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
going to have an opportunity to uh to
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
your thinking in in response to

um in response to some of the concerns
 
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:51.180 align:start position:0%
that I've raised I I I I don't know
 
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
whether that's been communicated to you
 
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
I've been talking with director Tilly
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
Miss Rogers
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
whom I know from my time on the vital
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
records privacy board so the so the the
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
question is whether uh you have some
 
00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:09.860 align:start position:0%
proposals because uh if if you've heard
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
discussed my concerns with them which I
 
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:14.300 align:start position:0%
suppose you have
 
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
then you know that I'm looking for some
 
00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:23.459 align:start position:0%
uh assuredness that uh that uh that One
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
Bad Apple cannot get into a situation
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
where the the very conscientious and
 
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
incompetent work of both the Secretary
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
of State's office but also DHHS to keep
 
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
these privacy concerns uppermost in your
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
eye and your mind when you're dealing
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
with people's confidential and very
 
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
often sensitive information I I served
 
00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:51.779 align:start position:0%
for uh something like five or six years
 
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
on the vital records privacy board so I
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
know the issues well I'm I'm not blind
 
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:02.220 align:start position:0%
to the tremendous need for this data to
 
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
be available and the screening that's
 
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:08.660 align:start position:0%
being done that that is protected uh
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
newborns from very very serious medical
 
00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
complications uh if left unrecognized
 
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
and unattended to
 
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
um so I understand the value of
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
statistical data and so forth so on by
 
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
the same token that questionnaire that
 
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
has the name the address all the
 
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
identifying aspects has also all that
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
sensitive information on it and that in
 
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
itself to the degree and that has to be
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
processed by a human being
 
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
that can't be processed by a computer
 
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
because you have to put it all into the
 
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
system then you can segregate out the
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
information that that doesn't need to be
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
part of the identity doesn't make any
 
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
difference in terms of disease or
 
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
something the disease or medical issues
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
that's something for the doctors for the
 
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:05.660 align:start position:0%
medical side
 
00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:08.339 align:start position:0%
the statistical side is something for
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
the statisticians but that questionnaire
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
that has all the information and the
 
00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:16.139 align:start position:0%
especially the identity before it's
 
00:13:19.569 --> 00:13:19.579 align:start position:0%
de-identified that's that's potentially
 
00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:23.459 align:start position:0%
uh and and I know because I haven't had
 
00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:26.459 align:start position:0%
personal experience but in my career as
 
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
a legislator I've had experience with
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
situations where bad apples have
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
betrayed their trust and had devastating
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
impact on certain situations so that's
 
00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm concerned about whether
 
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:47.220 align:start position:0%
there's not some way to further reduce
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
because I understand the sincerity and
 
00:13:53.329 --> 00:13:53.339 align:start position:0%
the protections that are out there and I
 
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
respect that the problem is
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh to the degree that somebody violates
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality and the trust of the
 
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
public and the presumably take an oath
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
or something like that to to maintain
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
those uh those standards
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
um to the degree they betray that
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
now the damage is done and we've we've
 
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:17.720 align:start position:0%
seen it in the field of Espionage right
 
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
one spy betrays the whole system uh and
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
so to the degree that that you are
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
thinking and your your colleagues are
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
thinking about further ways to protect
 
00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:33.899 align:start position:0%
people's privacy so that embarrassing uh
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
information but nevertheless vital for
 
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.019 align:start position:0%
the system to know uh cannot be attached
 
00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:40.930 align:start position:0%
the system to know uh cannot be attached
to

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:40.940 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
left attached uh to the to the person's
 
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.110 align:start position:0%
left attached uh to the to the person's
name

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
name
 
00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:50.339 align:start position:0%
if you can do that that would be very
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
don't believe this if there's any other
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
questions so this time and um
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt we agreed that we
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
would hold a um an in I'm going to call
 
00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:08.339 align:start position:0%
an informal study Edna is going to have
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
is going to meet with the Department the
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and the Department of
 
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to address
 
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
your concern
 
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
um would you like to would would someone
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
from DHHS like to
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
speak we have a question for someone in
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
particular somebody who has an interest
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
in this from
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
using the data for medical research
 
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:44.449 --> 00:15:44.459 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Trisha Tilley
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
I'm the director of Public Health good
 
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
morning my name Isola I'm the bureau
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
chief of Public Health statistic
 
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.610 align:start position:0%
chief of Public Health statistic
informatics

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
informatics
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um as representative
 
00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
groda said we're looking you know the
 
00:15:59.290 --> 00:15:59.300 align:start position:0%
Privacy part we plan on
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
removing for now and then looking at
 
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
working on that over the summer but I
 
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
have a question if you don't have a good
 
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
answer to it now that's fine you can
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
give it later and that is
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
um you know the the bill as it came out
 
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
of the senate had no address information
 
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
provided which you know the public
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
hearing we heard was a problem because
 
00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:23.579 align:start position:0%
then the only location information would
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
be where the birth occurred and that
 
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.750 align:start position:0%
be where the birth occurred and that
wasn't

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
granular enough an area to be useful on
 
00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:32.459 align:start position:0%
the other hand you know there's a number
 
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
of us concerned about privacy who really
 
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
have a problem with the actual address
 
00:16:38.889 --> 00:16:38.899 align:start position:0%
being provided and find that
 
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:41.220 align:start position:0%
problematic let's just say the question
 
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
is if the data that was provided didn't
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
have the full address but the ZIP code
 
00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:49.259 align:start position:0%
would that be granular enough for the
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
research and other purposes that you'd
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
want the data for
 
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the questions first of
 
00:16:59.889 --> 00:16:59.899 align:start position:0%
all DHHS under the statue is responsible
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
for releasing health related research
 
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
under the
 
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
approval of under the vital record
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
privacy board so each individual
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
application including the continuous use
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
of the data will need to go to the about
 
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
the record vital record privacy board
 
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
excuse me for review and approval in
 
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
terms of the data elements that are
 
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
selected in the application based on the
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
study needs the board members look into
 
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:36.260 align:start position:0%
each individual elements and
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
submit the questions or have a questions
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
on whether the justification is is good
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
enough I understand that but what the
 
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
um if the data that was I mean the
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office will get
 
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
data required for uh to create a birth
 
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
certificate on whatever that is and I
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
know there's a problem with the bill as
 
00:17:59.570 --> 00:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
I meant by the senate in that regard but
 
00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:03.539 align:start position:0%
if we had a bill that did not make the
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
actual address data available at all
 
00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:09.539 align:start position:0%
and if the DHHS I mean if server State
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
Vital Records these are for the birth
 
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
certificate they would get it
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
um but it would not go beyond that to
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
anyone under any circumstances and the
 
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
question is if that were not available
 
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
um you know would that be would you
 
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
still have enough data to do useful
 
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.470 align:start position:0%
still have enough data to do useful
research

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:30.419 align:start position:0%
I would say no because we do need to
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
have full addresses not just for
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
research but for our internal
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
um program purpose like you you may
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
heard on newborn screening we do need to
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
have the address in order to match the
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
person but back to the research um
 
00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
question it depends on the research
 
00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
study design if the study design is
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
um to look into each individual with the
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
interview they do need to have the
 
00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
actual address in order to perform this
 
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
kind of study so it really based on
 
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
depends on the study design and and
 
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
whether the study will need to do record
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
by record to have those four or partial
 
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
personal identifiers for their research
 
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
and and I would just add
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
um as um mentioned not only is there a
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
concern around the studies and the
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
health component of this but also the
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
department would require that address
 
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
information for other areas of the
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
department for functions within our
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
division of economic supports within our
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid fraud investigation there are
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
other opportunities within the
 
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
department where the at where the
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
address is really important so I think
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
that that's a perfect thing for us to
 
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
talk about in the summer to drill down
 
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
to more detail
 
00:19:48.169 --> 00:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you I think representative
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
look is
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's why we want to understand how all
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
this information is used because it's
 
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.850 align:start position:0%
this information is used because it's
all

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
it sort of spins out into different
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
things and we have to be will we have to
 
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
understand what it's being used for and
 
00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:03.419 align:start position:0%
then it's our it's our discretion
 
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
whether or not we that's the issue just
 
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
one one related thing and that is
 
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:08.270 align:start position:0%
one one related thing and that is
um

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
I mean hopefully you have you know
 
00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:12.059 align:start position:0%
control where the data goes and
 
00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:13.559 align:start position:0%
therefore hopefully you have an idea of
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
what all this data is used for so if
 
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
you could put something together if it
 
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't already exist saying each one of
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
these data elements and what are they
 
00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
actually used for thank thank you we've
 
00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
begun that developing that table to
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
understand and you know I think Dave
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
Wieters and others can provide a robust
 
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
description of our access policy around
 
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
who can have access to what components
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
of the data for what business purpose so
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
we've begun that work we're happy to
 
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
share that as as we continue and and be
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
informed by what happens during the
 
00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
settler study committee sure oh just
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
quick and that if you you know as you
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
put that together you have you know some
 
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
useful version of it if you could send
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
it to the committee so we can look at it
 
00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:57.059 align:start position:0%
before we actually end up meeting so
 
00:20:59.150 --> 00:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you yes we've begun that certainly
 
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
from the health component what data
 
00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
elements are For What and we're getting
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive list throughout the
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
department of which elements are used
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
for which program specifically okay
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair representative I
 
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out I live in a
 
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
community that technically shares a zip
 
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
code with another town and we are
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
separated by a river
 
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh obviously some of the environmental
 
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
issues on one side of the river would be
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
quite different than environmental
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
issues on the other side so I think just
 
00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
using a zip code would not be effective
 
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
for even a study that's trying to keep
 
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
the individual Anonymous I I get that I
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
mean there's that and then there's also
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
um if you have a zip code with few
 
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
enough people then it's not effectively
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
anonymizing either so there's issues on
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
both sides and as representative said I
 
00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:57.059 align:start position:0%
mean we need to understand how the data
 
00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
is being used and then there needs to be
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
a a policy determination of the
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
trade-off between
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
what they want to use the data for and
 
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
people's right to having the data and
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
maybe you know people can opt in for
 
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
parts of it or whatever but we can try
 
00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
and sort that out
 
00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:18.419 align:start position:0%
representative grassy yeah I'd just like
 
00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
to point out additionally in this case
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of times we need that
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
address data because when particularly
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at a case of
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
contamination of a well or a spillage or
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
something if without that data you're
 
00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:33.539 align:start position:0%
unable to pinpoint The Source you can
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
say it's a zip code but that's in a
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
whole community and if it's just a a
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
dump site in one area that's causing a
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
problem with premature or low birth
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
weights or diseases that children are
 
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.409 align:start position:0%
weights or diseases that children are
having

00:22:45.409 --> 00:22:45.419 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
um at Birth you know they're finding at
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
Birth for these children we try to
 
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
identify the source and without having
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
addresses you can't identify that source
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of issues we'll have to
 
00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
Schmidt

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
Schmidt
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
so what is the what is your intention
 
00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
Madam chair with regard to uh processing
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
the bill because uh you know it was made
 
00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
pretty clear to us in the initial
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
hearing that the the bill as amended by
 
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
the Senate just doesn't work
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
in a totality anyway
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
um a birth certificate with no name of
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
the child no name of the parents no
 
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
address is not a birth certificate it's
 
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:30.919 align:start position:0%
just an interesting statistic
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
but who this is is kind of like a
 
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
mystery so uh clearly the bill can't go
 
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
forward in my view in this fashion so
 
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
what is your intention with regard to
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
voting this out so the subcommittee has
 
00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:48.419 align:start position:0%
been presented an amendment which I
 
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
emailed to the committee subcommittee
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
yesterday which I just gave to you this
 
00:23:54.649 --> 00:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
is your Amendment you're referring to
 
00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
and um it takes it it um
 
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
basically uh includes the
 
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
decriminalization of entering your birth
 
00:24:06.529 --> 00:24:06.539 align:start position:0%
weight incorrectly
 
00:24:06.539 --> 00:24:07.070 align:start position:0%
weight incorrectly
um

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
and and it matters like that it does
 
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
limit the retention of birth worksheets
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
at both the hospital and
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
home births birthing centers for up to
 
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
seven years
 
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
and that's essentially the bill over the
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
course of the summer our committee will
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
meet with DHHS and the department and
 
00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:30.059 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and we'll you know
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
we'll drill down into the data
 
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
so that we understand any kind of
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
privacy concerns that we might have
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
and either put in legislation or not I
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
don't know what the committee will
 
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
decide representative grassy yeah one of
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
the questions I had and I'm glad to feel
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
folks from dhhsa here is that if we
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
limit this data for seven years and at
 
00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
that time that data would be disposed of
 
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
um would that limit your ability to
 
00:25:00.529 --> 00:25:00.539 align:start position:0%
probably track illnesses which may not
 
00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:02.700 align:start position:0%
manifest themselves in the first five or
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
six years of of a child's life but would
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
show up later in life
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
actually okay I it's just that the birth
 
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
center and Hospital doesn't have to keep
 
00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:15.539 align:start position:0%
it vital records would keep it
 
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
indefinite so the data is still there
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's just who has okay I just want to
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that somebody's keeping that
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
data and and we're able to fall back on
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
s privacy and security of the data that
 
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
you don't have data sitting in another
 
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
location indefinitely it would just
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
simply require Secretary of State's
 
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
office to maintain the data and we would
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
maintain the data along with our data
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
retention policies
 
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
okay so I have a question on this all
 
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
the records that the birth centers and
 
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
the hospitals are keeping now
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
do they have does this allow them to
 
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
delete that data how is that what's the
 
00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.390 align:start position:0%
delete that data how is that what's the
um

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:58.970 --> 00:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
what would the hospital do with the mvs
 
00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
what would the hospital do with the mvs
hi

00:25:59.440 --> 00:25:59.450 align:start position:0%
hi
 
00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:03.890 align:start position:0%
hi
[Laughter]

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
so I just don't want it to appear in a
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
dumpster someplace I'm sure there must
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
be some sort of record retention or
 
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
record deletion but I'd like to know
 
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair um for the
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
record Paula minahan Hospital
 
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:24.020 align:start position:0%
Association this um the seven years
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
coincides with current law relative to
 
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
the requirements of hospitals to
 
00:26:33.649 --> 00:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
maintain records so that and I did talk
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
with um deputy secretary Hennessy this
 
00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
morning so that this is fine the seven
 
00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
years we're we're fine with that
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
um and yes
 
00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:45.539 align:start position:0%
um after that they what typically
 
00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
happens my understanding is they
 
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.590 align:start position:0%
happens my understanding is they
actually

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.490 align:start position:0%
actually
um

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
um put it in in their own archives um or
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
they may actually
 
00:26:57.289 --> 00:26:57.299 align:start position:0%
um delete it but they don't have to hold
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
the actual record in their in their EMR
 
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
in their electronic medical record after
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
seven years but this is consistent with
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
current state law
 
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
okay thank you does anyone have any
 
00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
representative Locust I just wanted to
 
00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
confirm that the way this is worded
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
would allow
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals and birth centers to get rid
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
of all the back data that's you know
 
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
more than seven years old right
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
believe so I probably I you know what I
 
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
should check with um experts at the
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals to confirm that I will this is
 
00:27:33.649 --> 00:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
the first I'm seeing of this actual
 
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
language so let me verify that but I
 
00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:37.799 align:start position:0%
believe that that is the case they could
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
eliminate it okay another question I
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
mean the uh the data the records that
 
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
are kept
 
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
uh now and would continue to be kept
 
00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:49.340 align:start position:0%
really seven years I mean those are they
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
entirely or for the most part kept an
 
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
electronic form or they're actually
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
paper records electronic primarily yep
 
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
okay yeah but it's it's all part of a
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
lot of this data is in the um electronic
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
medical record now okay yeah I think and
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
I assume any personal data that uh has
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
gotten rid of that happens to be in
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
paper form is appropriately yes they
 
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:13.970 align:start position:0%
paper form is appropriately yes they
follow

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
um very strict HIPAA
 
00:28:18.909 --> 00:28:18.919 align:start position:0%
um requirements federal and state law
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
relative to privacy yes all right thank
 
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:26.149 align:start position:0%
relative to privacy yes all right thank
you

00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
where we have another minute or so uh so
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
I my understanding is that New Hampshire
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
is quite different from the rest of the
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
country in terms of basically it's 49
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
states on one side and New Hampshire on
 
00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
the other with regard to the fact that
 
00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:43.799 align:start position:0%
we have stuff being held by our
 
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office uh that is
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
is handled differently in other states
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
but that that our system it works at
 
00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
least as well or perhaps even better
 
00:28:59.330 --> 00:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
um and are we are we looking at what
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
other states are doing with the with a
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
view to to get to getting closer to them
 
00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
if their system is better uh or can you
 
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
speak to that I mean Paulie you may not
 
00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
be the person I don't believe I'm the
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
right person to answer that
 
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
well then maybe somebody would be the
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
does anybody want to answer that do they
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
is there anyone who can
 
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:31.740 align:start position:0%
nope okay well we'll keep that one for
 
00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:33.419 align:start position:0%
the summer
 
00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
that's fine by me as long as we're not
 
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
leaving it lying there nope nope nope in
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
the Dustbin never make just a quick
 
00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
comment and uh one difference about New
 
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is we actually have in the
 
00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
state constitution something that
 
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:48.980 align:start position:0%
specifies where the records are kept so
 
00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
that is a real I think that's major
 
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.769 --> 00:29:57.779 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to move Amendment
 
00:29:57.779 --> 00:30:02.389 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to move Amendment
2023-1728h

00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:04.980 align:start position:0%
may I have second
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
is there a further discussion on the
 
00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:12.740 align:start position:0%

is this the section one or two yes which
 
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
would then eliminate all of them no
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
no say this is it it keeps this and
 
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
eliminates all this that's right yeah
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
okay but we're decriminalizing that's
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%

to us to a bill if we wanted to as part
 
01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:01.380 align:start position:0%

01:35:19.689 --> 01:35:19.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
well how it was a bill that we oh my
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
it wasn't yeah it was it a bill Senate
 
01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:30.010 align:start position:0%
it wasn't yeah it was it a bill Senate
bill

01:35:30.010 --> 01:35:30.020 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
it was representative Shapiro's Bill
 
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
um we could include it I mean I I have
 
01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
an issue with the compacts in general
 
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
yes and I know uh that representative
 
01:35:50.689 --> 01:35:50.699 align:start position:0%
McGuire does as well but I don't have
 
01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
any specific questions I don't think
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
about this one okay does anyone else
 
01:35:58.129 --> 01:35:58.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:02.030 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:05.930 --> 01:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
do you have any new information or
 
01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
things that might prompt people to ask
 
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
questions about the social workers
 
01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:14.030 align:start position:0%
questions about the social workers
compact

01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'd like to think
 
01:36:17.149 --> 01:36:17.159 align:start position:0%
I can say things that would prompt
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
people to ask questions but it's a
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
pretty high bar to reach what I would
 
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
say is that you've all received
 
01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:25.860 align:start position:0%
information from social workers in the
 
01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
state we asked our members to reach out
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
to you not with a form letter but to
 
01:36:34.729 --> 01:36:34.739 align:start position:0%
explain to you how this compact would in
 
01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
fact impact their practice and so that's
 
01:36:39.050 --> 01:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
what we've asked them to give you I
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
think as you can see from the volume of
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
the correspondence you receive this is
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
an important issue for social workers
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's why this compact has come forward
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
that's why we've brought it Forward
 
01:36:51.890 --> 01:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
outside of regular order where it would
 
01:36:54.110 --> 01:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
have been introduced as a as a piece of
 
01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:56.030 align:start position:0%
have been introduced as a as a piece of
legislation

01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's so important for portability of
 
01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
licenses for being bringing social
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
workers into the state it's important
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
for military families it's important for
 
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
our members who live on state borders
 
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
and may have to maintain multiple
 
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
licenses to work in Vermont
 
01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and New Hampshire and New
 
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Maine and it's an
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
expensive proposition as well as a
 
01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
time-consuming proposition
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of I know folks have asked for
 
01:37:24.290 --> 01:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
data and I have shared data regarding
 
01:37:27.169 --> 01:37:27.179 align:start position:0%
the nurse Practice Act and that there
 
01:37:31.450 --> 01:37:31.460 align:start position:0%
was a 25 increase following the compact
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
introduction and acceptance 25 increase
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
in the availability of nurse
 
01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
practitioners in this state we reached
 
01:37:42.169 --> 01:37:42.179 align:start position:0%
out to the Council on state governments
 
01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
they have been coordinating this effort
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
Nationwide they've held the meetings in
 
01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
D.C they're the ones who helped to bring
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
all the states together to put this
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
forward we asked them for this data and
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
they indicated that that's one of the
 
01:38:00.110 --> 01:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
problems is that there is no data in in
 
01:38:03.649 --> 01:38:03.659 align:start position:0%
the country regarding the impact of some
 
01:38:06.290 --> 01:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
of these practices
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
what I will say and I understand
 
01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
director Courtney will be here a little
 
01:38:13.129 --> 01:38:13.139 align:start position:0%
bit later what she has said to me not to
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
put words in her mouth is that the compa
 
01:38:18.530 --> 01:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
and she negotiated this compact on
 
01:38:21.050 --> 01:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
behalf of New Hampshire the compact for
 
01:38:23.810 --> 01:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
social workers as put together is very
 
01:38:26.090 --> 01:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
similar to the nurse
 
01:38:28.010 --> 01:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
um compact
 
01:38:30.850 --> 01:38:30.860 align:start position:0%
in that it is a true multi-state license
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
so when social workers are licensed in
 
01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
and they go to another state they can
 
01:38:39.110 --> 01:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
begin practicing
 
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
they don't need to apply for a new
 
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
license when a social worker moves to
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
this state from any other compact state
 
01:38:48.169 --> 01:38:48.179 align:start position:0%
they can also begin practicing in New
 
01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has significant impact on
 
01:38:52.729 --> 01:38:52.739 align:start position:0%
Telehealth the portability of of clients
 
01:38:54.649 --> 01:38:54.659 align:start position:0%
being able to keep their
 
01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
um their clinicians if they're in
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
college if they move to a different
 
01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.709 align:start position:0%
college if they move to a different
state

01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
so it has a lot of significant impacts
 
01:39:05.930 --> 01:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
on practice and finally I would point
 
01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
out that last last session this
 
01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
committee adopted the Mental Health
 
01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:11.270 align:start position:0%
committee adopted the Mental Health
compact

01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
compact
 
01:39:14.090 --> 01:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
by a pretty strong vote
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
a number of you were here a number of
 
01:39:18.410 --> 01:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
you weren't here the reason I raised
 
01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
that is that the Mental Health
 
01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
Counselors are part of the same Board of
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
mental health practice that social
 
01:39:25.129 --> 01:39:25.139 align:start position:0%
workers are
 
01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
with one specialty having a compact and
 
01:39:31.629 --> 01:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
another specialty not having a compact
 
01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
it puts social work as a competitive
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
disadvantage in terms of the field and
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
the portability of the licensure I won't
 
01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
get into again the benefit of being one
 
01:39:41.689 --> 01:39:41.699 align:start position:0%
of the first few States I've talked
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
about that I'd be happy to answer
 
01:39:45.530 --> 01:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
questions on that but that's what I have
 
01:39:46.970 --> 01:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
to add
 
01:39:49.129 --> 01:39:49.139 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I think we're that's what
 
01:39:51.890 --> 01:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
we have what we need thanks
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
um so on my I'm just looking at the
 
01:39:59.149 --> 01:39:59.159 align:start position:0%
things that are easy to um discuss one
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
of them has to do with
 
01:40:03.890 --> 01:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
um in the in Statue it doesn't state
 
01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
that mental health boards have to have
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
public members that are independent from
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
the practice of mental health so we are
 
01:40:15.770 --> 01:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
going to put language in that and I've
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
asked oplc to make sure that all the
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
other boards have that Clause to be sure
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
that board members
 
01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
the public board members of any of the
 
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
boards at oplc are independent so that
 
01:40:29.930 --> 01:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
will be something that will be we will
 
01:40:33.410 --> 01:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
be putting on the non-germaine amendment
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
um the other
 
01:40:40.510 --> 01:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
has to do with a career ladder for lnas
 
01:40:42.590 --> 01:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
there was um
 
01:40:47.149 --> 01:40:47.159 align:start position:0%
lnas are an entry-level type of of a
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
position in the field and we'd like to
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
see what kind of advancement could be
 
01:40:54.169 --> 01:40:54.179 align:start position:0%
made between an LNA and a full
 
01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
practicing nurse so that there's a
 
01:41:00.050 --> 01:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
career path for women for I'm sorry for
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
um individuals who are men and women who
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
are lnas that's something that will be
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
01:41:09.770 --> 01:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
um the other has to do with
 
01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:11.450 align:start position:0%
um the other has to do with
um

01:41:11.450 --> 01:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going to telemedicine and it's um an
 
01:41:18.649 --> 01:41:18.659 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative McGuire
 
01:41:21.530 --> 01:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
which which allows telemedicine or
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
Telehealth anyone practicing
 
01:41:25.199 --> 01:41:26.270 align:start position:0%
Telehealth anyone practicing
um

01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:29.229 --> 01:41:29.239 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire be registered license
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
or or certified
 
01:41:35.450 --> 01:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
by the licensing body body
 
01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:36.470 align:start position:0%
by the licensing body body
um

01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:38.810 --> 01:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
before they can do that so that's going
 
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
to be so that will ex that will
 
01:41:43.490 --> 01:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
basically cover telemedicine for all
 
01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:45.950 align:start position:0%
basically cover telemedicine for all
practices

01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
practices
 
01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:47.350 align:start position:0%
practices
um

01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:50.750 --> 01:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
we don't think that
 
01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:53.930 align:start position:0%
we don't think that
um

01:41:53.930 --> 01:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
we need the merging of the mental health
 
01:41:59.330 --> 01:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
boards which is something that had been
 
01:42:02.570 --> 01:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 that we had looked at we
 
01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
believe that the language and the
 
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill 655 is
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
um addresses that
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:42:15.890 --> 01:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
um a concern though for making sure that
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
we have strict delineation between
 
01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
investigation and adjudication which is
 
01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:23.109 align:start position:0%
investigation and adjudication which is
something

01:42:23.109 --> 01:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:42:26.330 --> 01:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
attorney osterhout do you have a comment
 
01:42:29.330 --> 01:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
because I know that so recently in our
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
one of our house bills
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
there is a senate amendment that defines
 
01:42:40.609 --> 01:42:40.619 align:start position:0%
allegations and
 
01:42:40.619 --> 01:42:42.229 align:start position:0%
allegations and
complaints

01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
01:42:44.090 --> 01:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure that
 
01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
whatever we do doesn't
 
01:42:49.689 --> 01:42:49.699 align:start position:0%
you know that we have some some
 
01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
continuity between those things if any
 
01:42:55.010 --> 01:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
good morning Douglas sauser how general
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
counsel for oplc I have a comment but I
 
01:42:59.810 --> 01:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
I don't know how helpful it is so we
 
01:43:01.370 --> 01:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
just came
 
01:43:06.590 --> 01:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
from the hearing on Senate Edna on HB in
 
01:43:11.629 --> 01:43:11.639 align:start position:0%
amendment to HB uh 532 532 and there was
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
testimony on both sides on that very
 
01:43:16.629 --> 01:43:16.639 align:start position:0%
specific issue
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
and they were working on draft Amendment
 
01:43:22.850 --> 01:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
language so right now I don't know what
 
01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
that looks like until I see and that's
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's where executive director Courtney
 
01:43:30.010 --> 01:43:30.020 align:start position:0%
is right now she's over
 
01:43:33.229 --> 01:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
across the street
 
01:43:35.870 --> 01:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
so whatever changes
 
01:43:38.090 --> 01:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that we don't
 
01:43:40.729 --> 01:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
Collide or
 
01:43:43.129 --> 01:43:43.139 align:start position:0%
step over each other I think Crossing
 
01:43:45.890 --> 01:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
amendments I agree with that and I but I
 
01:43:47.209 --> 01:43:47.219 align:start position:0%
don't know what's going to be in the
 
01:43:50.030 --> 01:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
amendment at the end of the day it's is
 
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
the issue so I think it's something once
 
01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
we see that Amendment language we can
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
flag it and and make sure everything
 
01:43:57.770 --> 01:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
works together appropriately and who's
 
01:44:00.530 --> 01:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
writing that Amendment language you know
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
it's not me
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'll check okay
 
01:44:06.719 --> 01:44:07.970 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'll check okay
um

01:44:07.970 --> 01:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:44:12.169 --> 01:44:12.179 align:start position:0%
and those are really this the main
 
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
points that I wanted to make we do we
 
01:44:16.370 --> 01:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
are going to be sure that there's that
 
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
there's a in statute a delineation
 
01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
between adjudication and investigation
 
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
so that means that that will be clearly
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
defined and in-house Bill
 
01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
655 there was a lot of
 
01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:33.850 align:start position:0%
655 there was a lot of
um

01:44:33.850 --> 01:44:33.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of changes to
 
01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
disciplinary actions on the part of the
 
01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
board so we want to make sure that that
 
01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
language is
 
01:44:45.290 --> 01:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
promptly identifies who's responsible
 
01:44:51.250 --> 01:44:51.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:54.290 --> 01:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
yes representative yes yeah one thing I
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
was just looking at a houseboat 655 so I
 
01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
guess the senate committee
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
their recommendation was ought to pass
 
01:45:04.370 --> 01:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
without any Amendment and I believe the
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
Senate will be voting on that tomorrow
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
so we you know so we know what probably
 
01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
know what that's going to be
 
01:45:16.729 --> 01:45:16.739 align:start position:0%
could change but we should know in a day
 
01:45:16.739 --> 01:45:17.870 align:start position:0%
could change but we should know in a day
um

01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
and then looking at your list I mean
 
01:45:21.770 --> 01:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
there's some other minor ones Telehealth
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
for Pas I guess we managed to leave them
 
01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:24.709 align:start position:0%
for Pas I guess we managed to leave them
out

01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:45:27.649 --> 01:45:27.659 align:start position:0%
I think what we do with telemedicine and
 
01:45:30.050 --> 01:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
Telehealth on in number nine at the
 
01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:36.229 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
we still have to another issue within
 
01:45:42.649 --> 01:45:42.659 align:start position:0%
the oplc realm is the medical review
 
01:45:42.659 --> 01:45:45.169 align:start position:0%
the oplc realm is the medical review
subcommittee

01:45:45.169 --> 01:45:45.179 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:45:49.370 --> 01:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
which do we want to put that in the
 
01:45:51.169 --> 01:45:51.179 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment or do we want to
 
01:45:52.910 --> 01:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
wait until we have more time over the
 
01:45:55.250 --> 01:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
summer and I see rep I see director
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
Courtney is here don't sit down too soon
 
01:46:02.510 --> 01:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
okay I have a question yeah I'm I know
 
01:46:03.709 --> 01:46:03.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not really clear on what the medical
 
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
review subcommittee does what it is
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
well maybe that's that's a very good
 
01:46:12.590 --> 01:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
question and maybe so can you explain to
 
01:46:14.450 --> 01:46:14.460 align:start position:0%
the group what the medical review
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is yes and how we need to
 
01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
address the issues with that so with
 
01:46:22.850 --> 01:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
that group certainly thank you and I
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
apologize for being late I was at the
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
Senate um
 
01:46:28.490 --> 01:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
so the medical review subcommittee is a
 
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
body that's created in statute it's
 
01:46:33.770 --> 01:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
comprised of primarily Physicians but
 
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
also I believe a PA and some public
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
members they are appointed by governor
 
01:46:41.209 --> 01:46:41.219 align:start position:0%
and Council so they're they're
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
independent of the Board of Medicine and
 
01:46:46.450 --> 01:46:46.460 align:start position:0%
their charge is to essentially
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
investigate claims
 
01:46:54.169 --> 01:46:54.179 align:start position:0%
um there have been issues with the MRC
 
01:46:56.209 --> 01:46:56.219 align:start position:0%
reaching Quorum
 
01:46:57.890 --> 01:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
um I think in the last year they've met
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
50 of the time
 
01:47:02.530 --> 01:47:02.540 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:47:05.209 --> 01:47:05.219 align:start position:0%
individual members on the MRC have
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
reported that they are only able to
 
01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:08.629 align:start position:0%
reported that they are only able to
review

01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
review
 
01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
um about one case per month we receive
 
01:47:15.050 --> 01:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
over 200 a year so doing the math
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
obviously that doesn't work
 
01:47:20.090 --> 01:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
um which has created a backlog we have
 
01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:22.679 align:start position:0%
worked uh with the Board of Medicine to
 
01:47:26.450 --> 01:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
create some sort of uh work around a
 
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
different process to the extent that we
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
can through statute to move these cases
 
01:47:34.250 --> 01:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
along but there Still Remains a backlog
 
01:47:38.090 --> 01:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
my suggestion and I believe in Dr Baker
 
01:47:39.890 --> 01:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
from the Board of Medicine is here
 
01:47:42.109 --> 01:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
um I believe the Board of Medicine has
 
01:47:45.229 --> 01:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
voted on this but my suggestion is to
 
01:47:46.810 --> 01:47:46.820 align:start position:0%
proceed with a non-germaine Amendment
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
eliminate the mrsc establish the ability
 
01:47:54.050 --> 01:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
and rule for the Board of Medicine to
 
01:47:56.030 --> 01:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
establish an investigative committee
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
that is accountable to them because
 
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
that's the other issue here is once
 
01:48:03.290 --> 01:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
you're on there's no way to get you off
 
01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
other than going through the impeachment
 
01:48:06.850 --> 01:48:06.860 align:start position:0%
process even if you aren't able to
 
01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
attend and satisfy Quorum I think time
 
01:48:13.189 --> 01:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
is of the essence given that we have
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
cases that are backed up that are ready
 
01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
to be reviewed and are just waiting to
 
01:48:20.209 --> 01:48:20.219 align:start position:0%
go through this process and we would
 
01:48:22.250 --> 01:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
support a non-termain Amendment sooner
 
01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
rather than later
 
01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
and representative schwart has a
 
01:48:27.239 --> 01:48:28.070 align:start position:0%
and representative schwart has a
question

01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you director
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
um you stated that the review board is
 
01:48:35.209 --> 01:48:35.219 align:start position:0%
only handling one case a month
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
approximately uh in your opinion why is
 
01:48:38.639 --> 01:48:39.649 align:start position:0%
approximately uh in your opinion why is
that

01:48:39.649 --> 01:48:39.659 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
so they've reported that they can review
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
each each member can review only one
 
01:48:48.290 --> 01:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
case per month because of the time
 
01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:50.390 align:start position:0%
case per month because of the time
commitments

01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
commitments
 
01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:51.770 align:start position:0%
commitments
um

01:48:51.770 --> 01:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:55.010 --> 01:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
which is just not
 
01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:57.719 align:start position:0%
sufficient with what we need to do in an
 
01:48:57.719 --> 01:49:00.470 align:start position:0%
sufficient with what we need to do in an
investigation

01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:04.790 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
um

01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:08.090 --> 01:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
so do you know what the logic was for
 
01:49:10.570 --> 01:49:10.580 align:start position:0%
creating the separate medical review
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee when it was created in the
 
01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:15.659 align:start position:0%
statute yes I would divert a Dr Baker
 
01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
more on that one but my understanding is
 
01:49:19.490 --> 01:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
it stemmed from an audit I believe in
 
01:49:22.189 --> 01:49:22.199 align:start position:0%
2012 and it had to do with separating
 
01:49:24.530 --> 01:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
the duties the investigative duties from
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
the adjudicating duties which we fully
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
support that's very consistent with what
 
01:49:31.850 --> 01:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
655 proposes and the Board of Medicine
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
also supports that I will say that the
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine more than probably
 
01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
most regulatory boards is very cognizant
 
01:49:40.850 --> 01:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
of their need to separate those two
 
01:49:43.609 --> 01:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
functions the issue here is how it's
 
01:49:45.169 --> 01:49:45.179 align:start position:0%
been implemented and the fact that
 
01:49:47.689 --> 01:49:47.699 align:start position:0%
there's no accountability if they were
 
01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
able to establish a committee and Rule
 
01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
theoretically they could promulgate
 
01:49:53.209 --> 01:49:53.219 align:start position:0%
rules that would set forth the
 
01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
membership requirements such that oh if
 
01:49:57.410 --> 01:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
you missed three meetings or off and we
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know you can appoint somebody else
 
01:50:03.590 --> 01:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
so how does
 
01:50:08.870 --> 01:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
so if a complaint comes in about a
 
01:50:11.390 --> 01:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
concerning a doctor then it goes to the
 
01:50:13.729 --> 01:50:13.739 align:start position:0%
medical review subcommittee first is
 
01:50:13.739 --> 01:50:14.870 align:start position:0%
medical review subcommittee first is
that

01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
how it's supposed to work how it how
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's working now is that we receive a
 
01:50:21.649 --> 01:50:21.659 align:start position:0%
complaint the the office will review to
 
01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not it states it
 
01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
states a claim of professional
 
01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:26.810 align:start position:0%
states a claim of professional
misconduct

01:50:26.810 --> 01:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
misconduct
 
01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
um if it does not we send it over to our
 
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
physician investigator which is a
 
01:50:35.570 --> 01:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
contracted physician if he agrees we
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
send it over to the Board of Medicine
 
01:50:39.590 --> 01:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
and the Board of Medicine can dismiss
 
01:50:41.810 --> 01:50:41.820 align:start position:0%
um if if the office and the physician
 
01:50:44.330 --> 01:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
investigator agree that the complaint
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
States a claim it gets assigned to an
 
01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
mrsc member we'd like that MRC member to
 
01:50:53.209 --> 01:50:53.219 align:start position:0%
work directly with staff because staff
 
01:50:55.689 --> 01:50:55.699 align:start position:0%
are in a position to conduct interviews
 
01:50:58.609 --> 01:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
gather records that hasn't really
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
fleshed out at this point in time the
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
MRC largely relies on record review and
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
not necessarily interviews and other
 
01:51:09.890 --> 01:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
investigative processes so we're still
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
working through that because this
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
process is fairly new in our attempt
 
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
kind of get through this backlog and
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
work around not around but be creative
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
with the statutory requirements but um
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
but that's essentially the process now
 
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.189 align:start position:0%
but that's essentially the process now
so

01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
um would the language in HP 655 change
 
01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
this at all
 
01:51:32.689 --> 01:51:32.699 align:start position:0%
well that's an interesting question
 
01:51:32.699 --> 01:51:34.189 align:start position:0%
well that's an interesting question
representative

01:51:34.189 --> 01:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:51:38.450 --> 01:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
um and we haven't flushed it out legally
 
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
um because it does appear to conflict
 
01:51:43.250 --> 01:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
with the Board of Medicine practice act
 
01:51:46.669 --> 01:51:46.679 align:start position:0%
so I think one could take the position
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
that if 655 were to to pass and it
 
01:51:52.430 --> 01:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
conflicts uh with the establishment of
 
01:51:55.729 --> 01:51:55.739 align:start position:0%
the mrsc at 655 supersedes that and the
 
01:51:57.169 --> 01:51:57.179 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine doesn't necessarily
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
need to utilize the MRC the problem is
 
01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
um from the and I don't want to speak
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
for the board but I understand the
 
01:52:06.410 --> 01:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
board's concern is that they do want an
 
01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:08.450 align:start position:0%
board's concern is that they do want an
investigative

01:52:08.450 --> 01:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
investigative
 
01:52:12.410 --> 01:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
body comprised of peers to assist staff
 
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
and that's the issue so MRC does fulfill
 
01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
that function when it's working and if
 
01:52:21.709 --> 01:52:21.719 align:start position:0%
we were to rely it's only on 6 55 we
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have that investigative body of
 
01:52:24.719 --> 01:52:26.990 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have that investigative body of
peers

01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
peers
 
01:52:32.030 --> 01:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
um okay and so if you end up with a as I
 
01:52:33.470 --> 01:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
understand a subcommittee of the Board
 
01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
of Medicine doing this
 
01:52:39.709 --> 01:52:39.719 align:start position:0%
is that end up creating a conflating the
 
01:52:42.169 --> 01:52:42.179 align:start position:0%
investigatory and adjudicary uh
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
functions I don't think so the way we
 
01:52:48.109 --> 01:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
envision it is that we would pair staff
 
01:52:51.169 --> 01:52:51.179 align:start position:0%
investigators up with a number
 
01:52:53.689 --> 01:52:53.699 align:start position:0%
and a peer review investigator if you
 
01:52:53.699 --> 01:52:54.830 align:start position:0%
and a peer review investigator if you
will

01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
um many cases don't require expertise
 
01:52:59.810 --> 01:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
you know the you know I don't I don't
 
01:53:02.209 --> 01:53:02.219 align:start position:0%
like my Jello case or
 
01:53:04.129 --> 01:53:04.139 align:start position:0%
um somebody murdered me case you know
 
01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
that may not be something that requires
 
01:53:08.810 --> 01:53:08.820 align:start position:0%
medical expertise
 
01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:11.639 align:start position:0%
um but a lot of cases do and so what
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
we'd like to do is pair them up with a
 
01:53:16.010 --> 01:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
physician investigator and have them
 
01:53:18.729 --> 01:53:18.739 align:start position:0%
basically work the case up in tandem
 
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
Physicians by training you know are not
 
01:53:24.530 --> 01:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
necessarily graded interviewing
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
Witnesses they may be fantastic but they
 
01:53:27.890 --> 01:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
may not feel comfortable so that's why
 
01:53:30.729 --> 01:53:30.739 align:start position:0%
the staff expertise comes in and staff
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
on the other hand don't have the
 
01:53:34.609 --> 01:53:34.619 align:start position:0%
expertise of a physician so we think
 
01:53:37.070 --> 01:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
that collaboration is important
 
01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:53:41.450 --> 01:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:53:44.689 --> 01:53:44.699 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um represented uh
 
01:53:47.209 --> 01:53:47.219 align:start position:0%
represented sorry director in your
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
experience have you seen complaints
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:53:55.609 --> 01:53:55.619 align:start position:0%
possibly cross the line it's where it's
 
01:53:58.189 --> 01:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
difficult to determine whether it would
 
01:53:58.199 --> 01:53:59.169 align:start position:0%
difficult to determine whether it would
require

01:53:59.169 --> 01:53:59.179 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:54:02.770 --> 01:54:02.780 align:start position:0%
expertise in the field as opposed to
 
01:54:05.930 --> 01:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
administrative problems or is it pretty
 
01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:07.669 align:start position:0%
administrative problems or is it pretty
clear-cut

01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
clear-cut
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
I would
 
01:54:11.090 --> 01:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
I would say it's pretty clear I mean
 
01:54:13.010 --> 01:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
it's this same legal standard that
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
applies to any simple case as to whether
 
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
expertise is required or not
 
01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:20.149 align:start position:0%
expertise is required or not
um

01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:23.689 --> 01:54:23.699 align:start position:0%
so you know and and we do have curious
 
01:54:26.209 --> 01:54:26.219 align:start position:0%
if it's possible to craft something that
 
01:54:26.219 --> 01:54:27.050 align:start position:0%
if it's possible to craft something that
would

01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
specifically delineate one as opposed to
 
01:54:30.609 --> 01:54:30.619 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
possibly I mean I think that's why we
 
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
have the physician investigator too
 
01:54:36.229 --> 01:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
because I'll give you an example sexual
 
01:54:38.270 --> 01:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
assault that to me off the top of its
 
01:54:40.250 --> 01:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
head may not seem to be something that
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
requires expertise however if the
 
01:54:45.050 --> 01:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
examination requires you to do X Y and Z
 
01:54:46.850 --> 01:54:46.860 align:start position:0%
which is perceived by somebody to be an
 
01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
assault but is actually standard of care
 
01:54:51.290 --> 01:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't know that unless the
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
physician was able to open on that so
 
01:54:55.729 --> 01:54:55.739 align:start position:0%
that's why I think it's important to
 
01:54:57.649 --> 01:54:57.659 align:start position:0%
pair the two after talking in the
 
01:54:59.450 --> 01:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
position The Physician could say yeah no
 
01:55:02.270 --> 01:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
that's not an expertise that doesn't
 
01:55:06.050 --> 01:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is that we will
 
01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
replace the medical review subcommittee
 
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
with something like a peer review group
 
01:55:15.890 --> 01:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
right yes and it's Dr Baker do you have
 
01:55:19.250 --> 01:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:19.260 --> 01:55:31.129 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:55:31.129 --> 01:55:31.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:32.810 --> 01:55:32.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not good at this I think I got it
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
this time hit the button right
 
01:55:40.490 --> 01:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
yeah the the boards interest is to have
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
like every separated for the the video
 
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
could you please identify yourself I
 
01:55:48.770 --> 01:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
apologize I'm Emily Baker I'm the
 
01:55:50.209 --> 01:55:50.219 align:start position:0%
current president of the Board of
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
Medicine I'm a practicing obstetrician
 
01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:55.679 align:start position:0%
gynecologist up in Lebanon
 
01:55:55.679 --> 01:55:57.410 align:start position:0%
gynecologist up in Lebanon
and

01:55:57.410 --> 01:55:57.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:00.890 --> 01:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
I mean the functions that we support are
 
01:56:02.570 --> 01:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
separating adjudication and
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
investigation which is a function
 
01:56:09.050 --> 01:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
has been in the past super effective by
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
the by the mrse and Dr irum represented
 
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
executive director Courtney
 
01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
actually told you what's going on now
 
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
so the two things we have talked about
 
01:56:21.239 --> 01:56:22.430 align:start position:0%
so the two things we have talked about
is

01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
it's we it's not really a peer review
 
01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
committee necessarily because it's going
 
01:56:30.169 --> 01:56:30.179 align:start position:0%
to have public we prefer public members
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
to be on it
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
and the investigation would then come to
 
01:56:37.129 --> 01:56:37.139 align:start position:0%
this group and just like this
 
01:56:39.229 --> 01:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
deliberative body you work on the
 
01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
collective wisdom
 
01:56:43.070 --> 01:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
of the individuals who've done the
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
expertise can present to the board their
 
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
opinion and the board doesn't
 
01:56:48.770 --> 01:56:48.780 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree
 
01:56:51.050 --> 01:56:51.060 align:start position:0%
we've had stuff come to us where they
 
01:56:53.390 --> 01:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
said do discipline and we didn't we've
 
01:56:55.070 --> 01:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
had some the other way around where we
 
01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
said nope discipline is really important
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
from this so is
 
01:57:02.209 --> 01:57:02.219 align:start position:0%
having a group
 
01:57:04.970 --> 01:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
the can look at the investigations done
 
01:57:06.530 --> 01:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
that have been done with the assistance
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
of the staff
 
01:57:10.129 --> 01:57:10.139 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
look at each of them and use the
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
collective wisdom of the group to come
 
01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
up with a recommendation for the board
 
01:57:20.510 --> 01:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:22.490 --> 01:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
is very similar to what we're going to
 
01:57:25.070 --> 01:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
be doing with other boards whereas oplc
 
01:57:26.689 --> 01:57:26.699 align:start position:0%
is going to be doing the investigation
 
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
because they're going to be the
 
01:57:31.070 --> 01:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
investigatory arm and the boys will have
 
01:57:34.129 --> 01:57:34.139 align:start position:0%
a disciplinary and what we're saying is
 
01:57:37.970 --> 01:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
that in to help the oplc do the
 
01:57:37.980 --> 01:57:39.770 align:start position:0%
that in to help the oplc do the
investigation

01:57:39.770 --> 01:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
01:57:42.589 --> 01:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
there will be Physicians who they work
 
01:57:45.890 --> 01:57:45.900 align:start position:0%
in tandem with and will those is that is
 
01:57:47.930 --> 01:57:47.940 align:start position:0%
that I see everybody well see some
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
people shaking their heads so I'm
 
01:57:51.950 --> 01:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
thinking that this okay so how do we put
 
01:57:55.270 --> 01:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:58.250 --> 01:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
you have a question yeah I do and that
 
01:58:01.070 --> 01:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:03.290 --> 01:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
my understanding and I'm trying to see
 
01:58:05.089 --> 01:58:05.099 align:start position:0%
if my understands correct from uh what
 
01:58:07.370 --> 01:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
director Courtney said was that this
 
01:58:09.890 --> 01:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
peer review group would be made up of a
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
subset of the members of the board is
 
01:58:14.089 --> 01:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
that correct or not
 
01:58:14.099 --> 01:58:15.350 align:start position:0%
that correct or not
no

01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
um it and I think it's important in
 
01:58:19.609 --> 01:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
order to keep the functions separate
 
01:58:21.530 --> 01:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
um that they would be people appointed
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
by the board
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
um and I we have some draft language
 
01:58:26.990 --> 01:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
that would essentially give the board
 
01:58:28.970 --> 01:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority to establish this
 
01:58:31.250 --> 01:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
committee and I think you could make
 
01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
that statutory a change in their
 
01:58:35.570 --> 01:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
existing rulemaking Authority
 
01:58:35.580 --> 01:58:36.850 align:start position:0%
existing rulemaking Authority
okay

01:58:36.850 --> 01:58:36.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:58:39.649 --> 01:58:39.659 align:start position:0%
one of the the things that's important
 
01:58:41.570 --> 01:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
when we look at both of these bodies is
 
01:58:44.030 --> 01:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure there's a distribution of
 
01:58:46.129 --> 01:58:46.139 align:start position:0%
different kinds of Specialties if you
 
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
have six cardiologists to get nowhere
 
01:58:52.430 --> 01:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
and it's true both for the current mrsc
 
01:58:54.589 --> 01:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
and what we would any group we would
 
01:58:56.570 --> 01:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
have to work carefully at the membership
 
01:58:58.790 --> 01:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure there's adequate
 
01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
distribution of expertise
 
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
01:59:06.050 --> 01:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
form recommendations to the board for
 
01:59:07.930 --> 01:59:07.940 align:start position:0%
discipline for
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
confidentials letter of concern or
 
01:59:12.290 --> 01:59:12.300 align:start position:0%
dismissal so would all that be in rule
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
making okay because I want to make sure
 
01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:15.470 align:start position:0%
making okay because I want to make sure
that

01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:18.530 --> 01:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
we what concerns me is that the Board of
 
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
Medicine will be appointing the people
 
01:59:22.250 --> 01:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:22.790 align:start position:0%
to the
um

01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:24.530 --> 01:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
whatever this thing is called let's just
 
01:59:26.030 --> 01:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
call it a peer review
 
01:59:28.910 --> 01:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
and um I just want to make sure that
 
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:34.910 --> 01:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
relationship let's just say between the
 
01:59:37.310 --> 01:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine and those people that
 
01:59:38.689 --> 01:59:38.699 align:start position:0%
are appointed to this board that's
 
01:59:42.290 --> 01:59:42.300 align:start position:0%
supposed to be independent so how do we
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
kind of how is that create that yeah
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right too yeah that's a good
 
01:59:50.990 --> 01:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's a good
 
01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:52.910 align:start position:0%
that's a good
um

01:59:52.910 --> 01:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
that's a good point you could have and I
 
01:59:57.890 --> 01:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
I don't want to speak out of turn
 
02:00:00.109 --> 02:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
without thinking but you could have a
 
02:00:01.970 --> 02:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
process where the oplc has to also
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
approve of the of the appointed person
 
02:00:07.490 --> 02:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
such that if there was
 
02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
you know theoretically I want to appoint
 
02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
my brother
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
um we we could object and not approve it
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
you could have I mean we've seen that in
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
other statutes I would say mechanical
 
02:00:24.050 --> 02:00:24.060 align:start position:0%
statute has a similar Arrangement not
 
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
appointments but with respect to
 
02:00:30.830 --> 02:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
actually there's his fees and other
 
02:00:33.050 --> 02:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
certain charges that mechanical board
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
has where the board is able to perform
 
02:00:38.330 --> 02:00:38.340 align:start position:0%
certain functions with the approval of
 
02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
the executive director you could phrase
 
02:00:43.010 --> 02:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
it like that if you wanted some
 
02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:51.649 --> 02:00:51.659 align:start position:0%
is the stat is the mechanical board
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
process in statute or is it in general
 
02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.609 align:start position:0%
process in statute or is it in general
making

02:00:55.609 --> 02:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
making
 
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
well the mechanical board I just
 
02:00:58.910 --> 02:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
referenced the fact that there's a
 
02:01:01.609 --> 02:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
two-step process it's not it doesn't
 
02:01:03.050 --> 02:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with committees it
 
02:01:05.330 --> 02:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
actually has to do with fees
 
02:01:07.850 --> 02:01:07.860 align:start position:0%
um and other rules that they enact but
 
02:01:10.129 --> 02:01:10.139 align:start position:0%
the language is there such that there's
 
02:01:12.350 --> 02:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit more oversight
 
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
um that you could you could allow for in
 
02:01:17.689 --> 02:01:17.699 align:start position:0%
this circumstance as well
 
02:01:19.850 --> 02:01:19.860 align:start position:0%
so before you came to the meeting I just
 
02:01:22.250 --> 02:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that
 
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
you understand that I told the group
 
02:01:27.290 --> 02:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have a hearing on a
 
02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
non-germaine Amendment regarding these
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
things on the 22nd
 
02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
so we need to have the language like
 
02:01:37.609 --> 02:01:37.619 align:start position:0%
lickety-split in OLS so that we can put
 
02:01:39.770 --> 02:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
together an a non-germaine Amendment
 
02:01:42.050 --> 02:01:42.060 align:start position:0%
that's going to address the disciplinary
 
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
actions of boards versus the
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
adjudication right and that we're going
 
02:01:51.050 --> 02:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
to have the LNA career ladder
 
02:01:54.010 --> 02:01:54.020 align:start position:0%
amendment that we're going to address
 
02:01:57.709 --> 02:01:57.719 align:start position:0%
telemedicine Telehealth and telemedicine
 
02:02:02.689 --> 02:02:02.699 align:start position:0%
for professionals including Pas because
 
02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
that's part of it
 
02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:05.810 align:start position:0%
that's part of it
um

02:02:05.810 --> 02:02:05.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
we can and I don't know if
 
02:02:12.290 --> 02:02:12.300 align:start position:0%
um we're going to be able to
 
02:02:16.250 --> 02:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
get this bit of it done by then what do
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
you think
 
02:02:19.970 --> 02:02:19.980 align:start position:0%
I think this you could get done we could
 
02:02:21.530 --> 02:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
have done this afternoon it's actually I
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
think it's a pretty small statutory
 
02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:23.930 align:start position:0%
think it's a pretty small statutory
change

02:02:23.930 --> 02:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:02:26.930 --> 02:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the peer review only
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
the other items I think are a little bit
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
more involved which those items are the
 
02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
LNA piece
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
um the PA Telehealth
 
02:02:42.649 --> 02:02:42.659 align:start position:0%
is was proposed in an amendment that's
 
02:02:45.709 --> 02:02:45.719 align:start position:0%
before the Senate right now on 532. okay
 
02:02:47.870 --> 02:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
so it is possible that that's going to
 
02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
be covered elsewhere it's actually in
 
02:02:51.709 --> 02:02:51.719 align:start position:0%
two amendments
 
02:02:53.629 --> 02:02:53.639 align:start position:0%
um I know that the veterinarians and
 
02:02:55.850 --> 02:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
naturopathic doctors have also asked for
 
02:02:58.490 --> 02:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
a similar change that's also likely
 
02:03:00.649 --> 02:03:00.659 align:start position:0%
going to be included in those amendments
 
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
before the Senate
 
02:03:04.729 --> 02:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
um and that was on the music therapy
 
02:03:04.739 --> 02:03:06.350 align:start position:0%
um and that was on the music therapy
bill

02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:03:08.089 --> 02:03:08.099 align:start position:0%
um I think the L A Piece is going to be
 
02:03:09.410 --> 02:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
the one that takes a little bit more
 
02:03:12.530 --> 02:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
time okay but we're okay with doing the
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
um reorganizing the disciplinary action
 
02:03:18.290 --> 02:03:18.300 align:start position:0%
portion of of other boards
 
02:03:20.330 --> 02:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
so that was remember that was part that
 
02:03:22.189 --> 02:03:22.199 align:start position:0%
was in how the original bill of House
 
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 655 and we took that out to but we
 
02:03:28.609 --> 02:03:28.619 align:start position:0%
intended to put it back in as part of
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
our non-germana method so I just want to
 
02:03:31.490 --> 02:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
02:03:33.530 --> 02:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
that we have something beefy after all
 
02:03:35.689 --> 02:03:35.699 align:start position:0%
this work are you talking about the
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
proposed repeals representative yeah we
 
02:03:40.490 --> 02:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
that's that's okay something we already
 
02:03:43.070 --> 02:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
have in writing we could okay that to
 
02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
the committee and we want to make sure
 
02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:46.679 align:start position:0%
that um all public members are
 
02:03:48.530 --> 02:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
independent when they're on boards
 
02:03:50.689 --> 02:03:50.699 align:start position:0%
because it's not specific in the Mental
 
02:03:52.609 --> 02:03:52.619 align:start position:0%
Health Board statute
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
yes you might have to make the specific
 
02:03:56.510 --> 02:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
change in the mental health statute if
 
02:03:57.950 --> 02:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
we wanted to do it
 
02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:00.109 align:start position:0%
we wanted to do it
um

02:04:00.109 --> 02:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:02.149 --> 02:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
the easy way that would require cleanup
 
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
you could just do a modification in our
 
02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
statute and clean it up later that'd be
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
something that we'd have to look at
 
02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:10.370 align:start position:0%
something that we'd have to look at
okay

02:04:10.370 --> 02:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
I guess whatever we need to get done by
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
the time that
 
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
addresses the disciplinary actions it
 
02:04:21.770 --> 02:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
repeals of the disciplinary actions that
 
02:04:23.629 --> 02:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
re that he makes sure that all public
 
02:04:26.169 --> 02:04:26.179 align:start position:0%
members of all boards are independent
 
02:04:30.050 --> 02:04:30.060 align:start position:0%
that we address this piece this medical
 
02:04:31.550 --> 02:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
review piece
 
02:04:35.390 --> 02:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
and that our licensing process is is
 
02:04:38.209 --> 02:04:38.219 align:start position:0%
objective that there are no subjective
 
02:04:40.990 --> 02:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
components to our licensing process
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the board is I just
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that's another thing
 
02:04:46.609 --> 02:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
that we want that we that is in house
 
02:04:48.910 --> 02:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
bill that was the intent of house bill
 
02:04:54.530 --> 02:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
655. so those are four important things
 
02:04:57.169 --> 02:04:57.179 align:start position:0%
and um I just want to be sure that we
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
get that language
 
02:05:02.270 --> 02:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
and I'll be glad to help with that but I
 
02:05:04.790 --> 02:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
need you to help me write it
 
02:05:07.550 --> 02:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
um and I think that will take care of a
 
02:05:10.790 --> 02:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
significant part of
 
02:05:13.129 --> 02:05:13.139 align:start position:0%
there were some there were some language
 
02:05:16.250 --> 02:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
in hospital 655 that was removed and one
 
02:05:19.310 --> 02:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
of them was The Advisory board for
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists I know we have someone
 
02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
you from is this no okay so I I thought
 
02:05:28.609 --> 02:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
that the acupuncturist wanted to be and
 
02:05:31.970 --> 02:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
wanted an Advisory Board they wanted I'm
 
02:05:33.770 --> 02:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Dr Baker there's
 
02:05:37.550 --> 02:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:39.229 --> 02:05:39.239 align:start position:0%
um I just want to make sure I think that
 
02:05:41.930 --> 02:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
I'm almost positive that the acupuncture
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
award wanted to be an Advisory Board
 
02:05:46.930 --> 02:05:46.940 align:start position:0%
because they want
 
02:05:50.290 --> 02:05:50.300 align:start position:0%
oplc to address
 
02:05:53.810 --> 02:05:53.820 align:start position:0%
disciplinary issues within that board am
 
02:05:56.810 --> 02:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
I I think there were some
 
02:05:56.820 --> 02:05:58.609 align:start position:0%
I I think there were some
um

02:05:58.609 --> 02:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
conflicting information from various
 
02:06:02.750 --> 02:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and I also think there was
 
02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
some confusion I know that attorney had
 
02:06:07.370 --> 02:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
a conversation with the stakeholder
 
02:06:08.930 --> 02:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
group and I believe it was the
 
02:06:11.870 --> 02:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
association and after that they seemed
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
more amenable to becoming an Advisory
 
02:06:16.189 --> 02:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
Board the only board that I'm aware of
 
02:06:19.129 --> 02:06:19.139 align:start position:0%
that was interested
 
02:06:20.510 --> 02:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know that they took an
 
02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
official position
 
02:06:24.770 --> 02:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
um I would rely on attorney in to
 
02:06:26.330 --> 02:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
correct me but I think it was a nursing
 
02:06:28.850 --> 02:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
home administrators were interested in
 
02:06:30.290 --> 02:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
discussing it
 
02:06:32.350 --> 02:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
um just based on
 
02:06:35.709 --> 02:06:35.719 align:start position:0%
discomfort with the disciplinary process
 
02:06:39.530 --> 02:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
but I'm not aware of that being talked
 
02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:41.030 align:start position:0%
but I'm not aware of that being talked
about

02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:43.550 align:start position:0%
about
subsequently

02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
subsequently
 
02:06:46.970 --> 02:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
nursing home administrators they were
 
02:06:50.209 --> 02:06:50.219 align:start position:0%
originally in hb2 proposed to convert to
 
02:06:52.010 --> 02:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
an Advisory Board
 
02:06:52.020 --> 02:06:52.970 align:start position:0%
an Advisory Board
um

02:06:52.970 --> 02:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
and did we put that back in or no no the
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
only Advisory Board that's in hb2 right
 
02:07:01.370 --> 02:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
now is the assessing certification board
 
02:07:05.149 --> 02:07:05.159 align:start position:0%
under 310c which is different from the
 
02:07:07.010 --> 02:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
assessing Standards Board
 
02:07:09.649 --> 02:07:09.659 align:start position:0%
under dra the assessing certification
 
02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
board doesn't yet exist because they
 
02:07:14.450 --> 02:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
don't have any members okay so I know
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
that this was a sort of a gefuffle that
 
02:07:19.850 --> 02:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
happened right so the assessing standard
 
02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:21.350 align:start position:0%
happened right so the assessing standard
board

02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:07:23.629 --> 02:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to take that out of house
 
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
bill 655 because they're supposed to be
 
02:07:31.609 --> 02:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
under dra correct
 
02:07:33.530 --> 02:07:33.540 align:start position:0%
the assessing Standards Board is under
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
dra and in 655 it has that board being
 
02:07:38.930 --> 02:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
transferred over which we don't want
 
02:07:40.490 --> 02:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
which we don't want one of the
 
02:07:42.589 --> 02:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
Amendments before the Senate right now
 
02:07:46.609 --> 02:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
Edna on 532 is going to address that
 
02:07:49.970 --> 02:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:54.169 --> 02:07:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:58.189 --> 02:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
yeah well it's an amendment to 650.
 
02:07:59.930 --> 02:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
I don't think there can be amendment to
 
02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
655 well sorry it's a non-germaine
 
02:08:04.189 --> 02:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment that's being attached to house
 
02:08:08.530 --> 02:08:08.540 align:start position:0%
the poor music therapist Bill and so um
 
02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:10.370 align:start position:0%
the poor music therapist Bill and so um
administrator

02:08:10.370 --> 02:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
02:08:11.810 --> 02:08:11.820 align:start position:0%
so presumably if it has a later
 
02:08:13.850 --> 02:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
effective date it's supersedes exactly
 
02:08:17.089 --> 02:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
no okay exactly so the intent is not to
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
have a committee of conference on House
 
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 655. so that what we passed they
 
02:08:23.930 --> 02:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
passed and whatever discussions we have
 
02:08:26.810 --> 02:08:26.820 align:start position:0%
will be on bills that they attached
 
02:08:29.089 --> 02:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
amendments to
 
02:08:29.099 --> 02:08:30.250 align:start position:0%
amendments to
um

02:08:30.250 --> 02:08:30.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:33.290 --> 02:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
and now the assessing so the assessing
 
02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
certification board is addressed but the
 
02:08:38.270 --> 02:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
assessing oh yeah the assessing
 
02:08:40.850 --> 02:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
certification board is the one that
 
02:08:44.330 --> 02:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
back to oplc is that right
 
02:08:51.950 --> 02:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
um so the way 635 is worded is it had
 
02:08:54.169 --> 02:08:54.179 align:start position:0%
it had the transfer of the wrong board
 
02:08:56.570 --> 02:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
so it proposed to transfer the assessing
 
02:08:59.629 --> 02:08:59.639 align:start position:0%
Standards Board under I think 21
 
02:09:01.609 --> 02:09:01.619 align:start position:0%
I'm going to mess up the citation but it
 
02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
was the dra board
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
and we need the board that's established
 
02:09:09.709 --> 02:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
under 310c to move over here
 
02:09:13.070 --> 02:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
that I believe will be addressed in the
 
02:09:15.530 --> 02:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment to House Bill 532.
 
02:09:16.850 --> 02:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
okay so that switch is going to be
 
02:09:19.609 --> 02:09:19.619 align:start position:0%
addressed in-house bill in in-house Bill
 
02:09:22.129 --> 02:09:22.139 align:start position:0%
532 correct hopefully we won't have to
 
02:09:24.169 --> 02:09:24.179 align:start position:0%
think about that correct
 
02:09:26.209 --> 02:09:26.219 align:start position:0%
um in house bill to
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
the assessing certification board under
 
02:09:32.450 --> 02:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
310c is the only board that remains in
 
02:09:34.370 --> 02:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 that's proposed to convert
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
to an Advisory Board
 
02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
they don't want to be an Advisory Board
 
02:09:39.950 --> 02:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
have they spoken with you about this so
 
02:09:42.290 --> 02:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
I understand the assessing Standards
 
02:09:44.030 --> 02:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
Board does not want this certification
 
02:09:46.609 --> 02:09:46.619 align:start position:0%
board to be an Advisory board but the
 
02:09:48.530 --> 02:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
certification board itself doesn't yet
 
02:09:50.990 --> 02:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
exist so the certification board can't
 
02:09:56.109 --> 02:09:56.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
so how when will we when do you who is
 
02:10:02.330 --> 02:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
responsible for appointing people to the
 
02:10:04.729 --> 02:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
assessing certification board so that's
 
02:10:06.530 --> 02:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
a governor and Council appointment we
 
02:10:08.209 --> 02:10:08.219 align:start position:0%
did send out
 
02:10:11.450 --> 02:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
um we had a meeting with dra
 
02:10:13.129 --> 02:10:13.139 align:start position:0%
um regarding
 
02:10:15.709 --> 02:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
soliciting applications
 
02:10:17.930 --> 02:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
um we have an online application process
 
02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
where we receive the information and
 
02:10:22.550 --> 02:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
forwarded over to the governor's office
 
02:10:23.689 --> 02:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is they did
 
02:10:26.810 --> 02:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
communicate that to their licensees and
 
02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
I think we've only received one
 
02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:30.050 align:start position:0%
I think we've only received one
application

02:10:30.050 --> 02:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
application
 
02:10:31.729 --> 02:10:31.739 align:start position:0%
um and so that's one of the reasons I
 
02:10:33.229 --> 02:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
believe that a lot of these smaller
 
02:10:35.330 --> 02:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
boards were proposed to be converted to
 
02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:36.950 align:start position:0%
boards were proposed to be converted to
advisory

02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
advisory
 
02:10:39.649 --> 02:10:39.659 align:start position:0%
um was basically because there's just
 
02:10:42.169 --> 02:10:42.179 align:start position:0%
not a huge application pool to draw from
 
02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I would know is that
 
02:10:46.250 --> 02:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
the certification board itself or I'm
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
sorry the standing Standards Board which
 
02:10:51.050 --> 02:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
is under dra is a quite large so you're
 
02:10:53.570 --> 02:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
already trying to solicit people to seat
 
02:10:55.129 --> 02:10:55.139 align:start position:0%
that board
 
02:10:55.139 --> 02:10:55.970 align:start position:0%
that board
um

02:10:55.970 --> 02:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
so I think that was part of the thought
 
02:10:59.209 --> 02:10:59.219 align:start position:0%
process behind converting them to an
 
02:11:01.129 --> 02:11:01.139 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board
 
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
So speaking of that one of the things
 
02:11:06.770 --> 02:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about is reducing the
 
02:11:09.169 --> 02:11:09.179 align:start position:0%
number of members on boards right we
 
02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
started that process
 
02:11:13.729 --> 02:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
is that something else that we can do as
 
02:11:15.649 --> 02:11:15.659 align:start position:0%
a non-germain Amendment
 
02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
are there any boards that come to mind
 
02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
that where we could reduce the number of
 
02:11:21.370 --> 02:11:21.380 align:start position:0%
public members or the number of members
 
02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
total in total so that the boards can
 
02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
become more effective with a smaller
 
02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:27.589 align:start position:0%
become more effective with a smaller
quorum

02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
quorum
 
02:11:29.930 --> 02:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
I think certainly some of the boards
 
02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
um that are struggling with Quorum right
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
now uh should be considered to have a
 
02:11:36.350 --> 02:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
reduction in members and or converting
 
02:11:44.270 --> 02:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:47.209 --> 02:11:47.219 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll talk about that okay
 
02:11:48.589 --> 02:11:48.599 align:start position:0%
does the committee have any other
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
questions yes I just want to go back to
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
the medical review subcommittee part and
 
02:11:56.089 --> 02:11:56.099 align:start position:0%
that is um
 
02:11:58.189 --> 02:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
As I understood it the general idea is
 
02:12:00.770 --> 02:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
that oplc would handle the investigation
 
02:12:02.330 --> 02:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
and then the boards would do the
 
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
adjudication so
 
02:12:06.890 --> 02:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
I I have similar concerns representative
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
Grodd I'm like
 
02:12:10.010 --> 02:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
if that's the case you want to keep
 
02:12:11.570 --> 02:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
things separate how does it make sense
 
02:12:11.580 --> 02:12:12.709 align:start position:0%
things separate how does it make sense
for

02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:12:15.410 --> 02:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
the medical board even to be appointing
 
02:12:16.850 --> 02:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
the people
 
02:12:18.530 --> 02:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
on this I mean I don't know if there's
 
02:12:20.810 --> 02:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
you know if oplc could find people or
 
02:12:23.390 --> 02:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
some other thing but that just seems
 
02:12:25.790 --> 02:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
not quite with the spirit of keeping
 
02:12:27.229 --> 02:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
them separate so I'm just wondering what
 
02:12:28.910 --> 02:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
the thought was behind that
 
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
so our thought process is we want to be
 
02:12:32.930 --> 02:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
collaborative and I don't think that we
 
02:12:35.330 --> 02:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
considered it from that angle um I don't
 
02:12:36.530 --> 02:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
know that the Board of Medicine did
 
02:12:36.540 --> 02:12:37.910 align:start position:0%
know that the Board of Medicine did
either

02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
either
 
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
um from the agency's standpoint we would
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
um if the committee is concerned about
 
02:12:45.169 --> 02:12:45.179 align:start position:0%
that I think what you could do is have
 
02:12:47.149 --> 02:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
the board establish
 
02:12:50.930 --> 02:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
what Specialties or what they need on
 
02:12:54.169 --> 02:12:54.179 align:start position:0%
this committee and have oplc do the
 
02:12:55.729 --> 02:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
actual appointments
 
02:12:55.739 --> 02:12:58.010 align:start position:0%
actual appointments
um

02:12:58.010 --> 02:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:01.550 --> 02:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
you could bifurcate that arrangement to
 
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
make it crystal clear that the board
 
02:13:04.250 --> 02:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any hands in making the
 
02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
appointments I think from our
 
02:13:08.689 --> 02:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
perspective what we just want is some
 
02:13:10.609 --> 02:13:10.619 align:start position:0%
accountability and some ability to have
 
02:13:13.850 --> 02:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
people uh transition off the board if
 
02:13:15.709 --> 02:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
they're not being productive and
 
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
attending meetings okay yeah I mean that
 
02:13:19.129 --> 02:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
seems like a separate thing which
 
02:13:20.450 --> 02:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
certainly makes sense
 
02:13:20.460 --> 02:13:22.609 align:start position:0%
certainly makes sense
um

02:13:22.609 --> 02:13:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:25.490 --> 02:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
one question on this board I mean
 
02:13:27.890 --> 02:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
is this a volunteer thing are these
 
02:13:30.649 --> 02:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
people paid how does this and is that
 
02:13:33.709 --> 02:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
going to stay the same it's voluntary
 
02:13:36.649 --> 02:13:36.659 align:start position:0%
um they do receive a small burdium I
 
02:13:38.030 --> 02:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
think it's like a hundred dollars a
 
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
meeting obviously nowhere close to
 
02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursing them for the cost of uh
 
02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:44.209 align:start position:0%
reimbursing them for the cost of uh
losing

02:13:44.209 --> 02:13:44.219 align:start position:0%
losing
 
02:13:46.850 --> 02:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
um a day's worth of work
 
02:13:48.589 --> 02:13:48.599 align:start position:0%
um I think that's something that we
 
02:13:51.410 --> 02:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
could explore uh I think that's also
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
something that could be addressed
 
02:13:53.930 --> 02:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
through rulemaking you know what the
 
02:13:56.510 --> 02:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
qualifications are what the what you
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
would receive for reimbursement and and
 
02:14:02.930 --> 02:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
I would say that from from a litigation
 
02:14:05.089 --> 02:14:05.099 align:start position:0%
standpoint it's not uncommon to pay
 
02:14:08.629 --> 02:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
experts 250 to even a thousand dollars
 
02:14:13.550 --> 02:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
an hour so I mean 100 a day or 100 a
 
02:14:16.490 --> 02:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
meeting versus that I mean there's that
 
02:14:18.290 --> 02:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
could be why we're having a hard time
 
02:14:20.569 --> 02:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
and getting applicants
 
02:14:22.669 --> 02:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
right I'm not pushing at this point in
 
02:14:24.890 --> 02:14:24.900 align:start position:0%
the process to with not much time to do
 
02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
something about this but maybe something
 
02:14:26.159 --> 02:14:26.930 align:start position:0%
something about this but maybe something
to

02:14:26.930 --> 02:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
think about for the future I don't know
 
02:14:34.250 --> 02:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:37.310 --> 02:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
so when do you think we could have the
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
language for for these things
 
02:14:43.790 --> 02:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
let me remind you of the list
 
02:14:46.850 --> 02:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
I or I can certainly meet with you to
 
02:14:48.589 --> 02:14:48.599 align:start position:0%
make sure that we
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
because we need I'd like to have the
 
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
language for this for the committee over
 
02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
the next hearing on Friday Monday the
 
02:14:59.209 --> 02:14:59.219 align:start position:0%
22nd well Monday to the 22nd is the
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
hearing language would need to be here
 
02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
by the Friday before okay what day is
 
02:15:06.649 --> 02:15:06.659 align:start position:0%
that the 18th
 
02:15:09.290 --> 02:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
I'm terrible with Friday before the 22nd
 
02:15:12.050 --> 02:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
the 19th to 19th
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
okay so that means that we needed to um
 
02:15:19.970 --> 02:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
we needed to OLS by this 18th right I
 
02:15:26.030 --> 02:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:29.390 --> 02:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
we'll figure it out okay okay that time
 
02:15:31.490 --> 02:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
frame shouldn't be a problem okay good
 
02:15:33.290 --> 02:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
is there anything else that the
 
02:15:36.109 --> 02:15:36.119 align:start position:0%
committee wants to discuss at this time
 
02:15:38.270 --> 02:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ashwood and
 
02:15:42.410 --> 02:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
02:15:44.569 --> 02:15:44.579 align:start position:0%
um yes I was just checking and I thought
 
02:15:46.310 --> 02:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
I recalled a bill
 
02:15:49.850 --> 02:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
that I think is going to help the boards
 
02:15:53.629 --> 02:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
meet and that's houseville 308 in Senate
 
02:15:56.410 --> 02:15:56.420 align:start position:0%
Judiciary which will allow some members
 
02:15:59.870 --> 02:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
to attend remotely
 
02:16:01.790 --> 02:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
um do you agree that that's likely to
 
02:16:04.550 --> 02:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
help with this backlog on some of the
 
02:16:07.370 --> 02:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
boards I think it would certainly help
 
02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:08.030 align:start position:0%
boards I think it would certainly help
um

02:16:08.030 --> 02:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:10.430 --> 02:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
yes I think if people could if more
 
02:16:12.290 --> 02:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
people could attend remotely that would
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:17.209 --> 02:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
02:16:19.729 --> 02:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so it seems to me
 
02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:23.650 align:start position:0%
that the these investigatory situations
 
02:16:23.650 --> 02:16:24.770 align:start position:0%
that the these investigatory situations
[Music]

02:16:24.770 --> 02:16:24.780 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
um are
 
02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:28.370 align:start position:0%
um are
uh

02:16:28.370 --> 02:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:30.709 --> 02:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
I have a question about that because it
 
02:16:32.929 --> 02:16:32.939 align:start position:0%
seems to me that that most of the things
 
02:16:38.929 --> 02:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
um substance abuse situations
 
02:16:46.250 --> 02:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
or ethical situations I don't I don't it
 
02:16:48.169 --> 02:16:48.179 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to me that very often
 
02:16:49.969 --> 02:16:49.979 align:start position:0%
you're going to have situations that
 
02:16:51.530 --> 02:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
you're going to be investigating
 
02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
plumbers that can't Plumb or
 
02:16:56.209 --> 02:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
electricians that don't know that black
 
02:16:58.669 --> 02:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
goes to Black and not to red and so
 
02:17:02.150 --> 02:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
forth uh technical questions doctors
 
02:17:04.849 --> 02:17:04.859 align:start position:0%
that don't know how to to uh you know
 
02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
that you have to do X first and then Y
 
02:17:09.969 --> 02:17:09.979 align:start position:0%
and not the other way around it it it it
 
02:17:12.469 --> 02:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
you have must have some experience
 
02:17:16.129 --> 02:17:16.139 align:start position:0%
already where uh you you know what
 
02:17:19.370 --> 02:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
percentage of complaints involve people
 
02:17:22.429 --> 02:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
who are simply incompetent in their
 
02:17:26.450 --> 02:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
trade or profession and other people who
 
02:17:28.610 --> 02:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
are have got other problems either
 
02:17:28.620 --> 02:17:30.110 align:start position:0%
are have got other problems either
they're

02:17:30.110 --> 02:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:17:34.549 --> 02:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
they're they're bad billers uh or
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
they're bad record Keepers and so forth
 
02:17:39.950 --> 02:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh it's more that they have
 
02:17:44.089 --> 02:17:44.099 align:start position:0%
personal failings and therefore
 
02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to involve how you set up the
 
02:17:50.270 --> 02:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
the boards if the oplc is going to be
 
02:17:52.490 --> 02:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
doing it clearly you're not going to
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
have expertise in how the professions in
 
02:17:59.929 --> 02:17:59.939 align:start position:0%
other words how plumbers Plumb uh and
 
02:18:05.770 --> 02:18:05.780 align:start position:0%
how uh OB gyns uh deliver babies
 
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to be about
 
02:18:12.410 --> 02:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
ethical failings or
 
02:18:16.089 --> 02:18:16.099 align:start position:0%
things like building maybe stealing from
 
02:18:20.270 --> 02:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh from a client or customer and so
 
02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:21.349 align:start position:0%
uh from a client or customer and so
forth

02:18:21.349 --> 02:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
forth
 
02:18:24.110 --> 02:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
and and you presumably have some
 
02:18:26.929 --> 02:18:26.939 align:start position:0%
experience of this already so that you
 
02:18:26.939 --> 02:18:28.310 align:start position:0%
experience of this already so that you
have

02:18:28.310 --> 02:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:18:30.349 --> 02:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
uh because otherwise you're going to
 
02:18:32.629 --> 02:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
have to have
 
02:18:36.169 --> 02:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
only doctors know how to to to do the
 
02:18:39.049 --> 02:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
medical side of things and electricians
 
02:18:41.570 --> 02:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
know how to do the electrician side of
 
02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:42.950 align:start position:0%
know how to do the electrician side of
things

02:18:42.950 --> 02:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:18:44.650 --> 02:18:44.660 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:18:47.810 --> 02:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a big difference what
 
02:18:49.790 --> 02:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
kind of an investigation you're going to
 
02:18:51.709 --> 02:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
conduct no
 
02:18:55.250 --> 02:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
I think it's very similar to how a civil
 
02:18:58.389 --> 02:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
case is handled in the private practice
 
02:19:00.889 --> 02:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
for example
 
02:19:03.730 --> 02:19:03.740 align:start position:0%
um in a mental medical malpractice claim
 
02:19:06.770 --> 02:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
lawyers work up the case lawyers don't
 
02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
typically know medicine but they know
 
02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
that they have to talk to other people
 
02:19:13.190 --> 02:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
and they need to obtain the expert
 
02:19:15.230 --> 02:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
qualifications in order to determine
 
02:19:16.730 --> 02:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
whether there's been a violation of the
 
02:19:19.849 --> 02:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
standard of care but the Physicians are
 
02:19:21.530 --> 02:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
not running the investigation because
 
02:19:24.770 --> 02:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
the Physicians know their their
 
02:19:26.389 --> 02:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
expertise and their expertise only
 
02:19:29.469 --> 02:19:29.479 align:start position:0%
they're not going to essentially depose
 
02:19:33.169 --> 02:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and gather facts and so that's
 
02:19:35.450 --> 02:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
how we handle our cases we get our our
 
02:19:38.810 --> 02:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
case you know what is the complaint is
 
02:19:41.690 --> 02:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
the complaint a substance use issue we
 
02:19:43.370 --> 02:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
typically work with PHP professional
 
02:19:46.070 --> 02:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
sales program if that's the issue is an
 
02:19:48.410 --> 02:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
ethical violation
 
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
um if so maybe it's plainly stated what
 
02:19:52.310 --> 02:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
the ethical violation is is and you
 
02:19:54.010 --> 02:19:54.020 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily need expert testimony
 
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
or is it this person was grossly
 
02:19:58.790 --> 02:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
negligent because pure negligence
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
typically won't get you there to
 
02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
misconduct and if that's the case you
 
02:20:05.150 --> 02:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
certainly need expertise on that and um
 
02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
on the trades issue we don't see that a
 
02:20:09.849 --> 02:20:09.859 align:start position:0%
lot but we do have inspectors in-house
 
02:20:12.710 --> 02:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
and we always have the capability of
 
02:20:14.570 --> 02:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
recusing a board member if we absolutely
 
02:20:18.410 --> 02:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
need it as of late we've contracted a
 
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
lot before experts so that we don't need
 
02:20:23.690 --> 02:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
to make those requests of various boards
 
02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
but part of um
 
02:20:28.429 --> 02:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
part of legal training and background is
 
02:20:30.650 --> 02:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
to know what you don't know and when you
 
02:20:34.130 --> 02:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
need expertise and what requires expert
 
02:20:36.670 --> 02:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
qualifications and expert testimonies so
 
02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
we are already utilizing that process to
 
02:20:43.250 --> 02:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:45.610 --> 02:20:45.620 align:start position:0%
follow-up on a different subject
 
02:20:48.170 --> 02:20:48.180 align:start position:0%
so the thing is with regard to the
 
02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
assessing Standards Board and the
 
02:20:52.270 --> 02:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
assessing certification board
 
02:20:55.070 --> 02:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
this was just a
 
02:20:58.130 --> 02:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
screw up to put it bluntly where where
 
02:20:59.929 --> 02:20:59.939 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:21:03.050 --> 02:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
the this was supposed to go
 
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
the assessing certification board was
 
02:21:08.570 --> 02:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
supposed to be it was a brand new board
 
02:21:10.730 --> 02:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
that was supposed to be set up under
 
02:21:13.250 --> 02:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
oplc to handle
 
02:21:16.690 --> 02:21:16.700 align:start position:0%
certification issues to some degree
 
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
disciplinary things
 
02:21:23.389 --> 02:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
um and initial licensing things and the
 
02:21:25.730 --> 02:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
assessing Standards Board was supposed
 
02:21:27.309 --> 02:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
to stay with
 
02:21:31.010 --> 02:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
dra where it had always been and instead
 
02:21:34.370 --> 02:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
they got switched okay so the babies
 
02:21:36.830 --> 02:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
went home with the wrong with the wrong
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
parents and so it but it should we I
 
02:21:42.670 --> 02:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
think we should make sure that we have
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
input from the assessor who or somebody
 
02:21:48.650 --> 02:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
who caught this mistake in the first
 
02:21:48.660 --> 02:21:49.610 align:start position:0%
who caught this mistake in the first
place

02:21:49.610 --> 02:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:21:52.370 --> 02:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
okay I think we've got it under control
 
02:21:54.889 --> 02:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
thank you well it is under control but
 
02:21:57.050 --> 02:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
only if we know that it was just a
 
02:21:57.060 --> 02:21:58.070 align:start position:0%
only if we know that it was just a
simple

02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
simple
 
02:22:02.210 --> 02:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
it was a complete goof it's a goof I I
 
02:22:04.429 --> 02:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
know it's okay we're allowed we're all
 
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
allowed a goof
 
02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
okay is that it I think we're done thank
 
02:22:11.450 --> 02:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
you very much I closed the hearing on
 
02:22:31.790 --> 02:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:31.800 --> 02:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
foreign
