00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
experts in the room yes mr hoffman do
 
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
you have a comment we're monitoring the
 
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
youtube uh feed and we don't see it yet
 
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
so kevin just went okay so i should
 
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
repeat everything once we get youtube
 
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
spinning probably i think so
 
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
all right so so that was good i
 
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
i i i
 
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
i hate to ruin the surprise for you all
 
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
but i'll say something substantially
 
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
similar in a few minutes
 
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
i've been informed that uh youtube is
 
00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 align:start position:0%
broadcasting and it's clear that the
 
00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 align:start position:0%
microphones are working at least inside
 
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
the room so bn212 i will bring us out of
 
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
the way
 
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to conduct this is that two
 
00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
days ago
 
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
we walked through
 
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
a version of
 
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.190 align:start position:0%
a version of
1677

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
1677
 
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
an umberger amendment and we found a
 
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
number of places where we thought
 
00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 align:start position:0%
alternative language ought to be
 
00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:32.950 align:start position:0%
alternative language ought to be
considered

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 align:start position:0%
we convened a work group the work group
 
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
consisted of mr hoffman and mr ripple of
 
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
the lba
 
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
the attorney general i believe was
 
00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
directly involved uh represent
 
00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
general formella
 
00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
and i believe representative
 
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
bob lin
 
00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
also participated in the work work were
 
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
there any other members of the work
 
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.230 align:start position:0%
there any other members of the work
group

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.749 align:start position:0%
group
[Music]

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
so um the process i think we can follow
 
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
today is to take the
 
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
highlighted version of the changes in
 
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
the umberger amendment which is
 
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.589 align:start position:0%
the umberger amendment which is
0936

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.710 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
mr hoffman will walk us through it he'll
 
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
set the stage for
 
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
the change that was made and and his his
 
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the rationale behind
 
00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
it and if they're anybody
 
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
on the committee that has questions
 
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll dive into it at that point
 
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
and bring subject matter experts up
 
00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
and i i would like to encourage um
 
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know the plaintiff's counsel to be
 
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
assertive if uh if you want
 
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
to say something i i want you to make
 
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 align:start position:0%

all right so with a stage set uh mr
 
00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
hoffman would you please uh
 
00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 align:start position:0%

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.030 align:start position:0%
lead us off
[Music]

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
as you recall in the last meeting
 
00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
the committee took several
 
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
straw poll votes on
 
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
certain parts of the amendment
 
00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
agreed that things would be on hold for
 
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
the work group to consider
 
00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
so as kevin put this document together
 
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
he's noted that in the margin
 
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
so where you see work group removed
 
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
that was based on
 
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
work of the work group
 
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
further down you'll see
 
00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
language revised by committee
 
00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
it's just a distinguishing
 
00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
so mr hoffman um
 
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
i should have given you one more um
 
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.229 align:start position:0%
i should have given you one more um
guideline

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
guideline
 
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh there are people that need to know
 
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
this material because they'll be voting
 
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
on it and this for some of them is the
 
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
first time they've seen these changes so
 
00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
so i think we can take our time and and
 
00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
and and be expansive in the description
 
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
of each item if
 
00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
please sure i just wanted to note the
 
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
difference between the the two types of
 
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
remarks in in the margin oh okay i
 
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
thought you'd already started rolling
 
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
and just knocked out two of them already
 
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
no not quite that quick okay
 
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
so if we look on page one on line
 
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.949 align:start position:0%
so if we look on page one on line
13.

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the earlier versions
 
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
a retired judge was listed there as a
 
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
possible candidate for administrator the
 
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
work group met
 
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
and based on the likelihood of a judge
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
electing to do this
 
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
and other complications with the
 
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
judicial retirement system
 
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
the retired judge was removed from this
 
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.189 align:start position:0%
the retired judge was removed from this
section

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
and if if
 
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
to the members of the work group if if
 
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not describing this the way you'd
 
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
or reflecting accurately please chime in
 
00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
and i'll be prone on some of these to
 
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
use my judgment of whether or not it's
 
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 align:start position:0%
controversial if i don't think it is i'm
 
00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
just i won't stop mr hoffman from going
 
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
to the next one but if anyone does have
 
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
an issue with any of these things again
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
just get my attention and and we'll make
 
00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:13.990 align:start position:0%
just get my attention and and we'll make
sure

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the page which is the
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
next change
 
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
the committee had
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
made this change to the definitions of
 
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
physical abuse and sexual abuse
 
00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 align:start position:0%
which i believe were
 
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
adopting the common law reference and
 
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
just uh cleaning up some differences in
 
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
um last last two days ago we did not
 
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.629 align:start position:0%
um last last two days ago we did not
really

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.110 align:start position:0%
really
explore

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
explore
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
the meaning of single incident and what
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
that could mean to uh how the guidelines
 
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
get developed
 
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
and um and we've otherwise have accepted
 
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff's language on this
 
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.029 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff's language on this
but

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
i i have concerns that the single
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
incident may
 
00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:15.189 align:start position:0%
incident may
cause

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
cause
 
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
in this definition i think a single
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
incident is sufficient to initiate a
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
claim but what i'm curious about is if
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
the impact of each incident
 
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
being a claim
 
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
if or if somebody is abused in the same
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
way 10 times
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
is is that 10 individual claims or
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
would the guidelines incorporate as a
 
00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:40.150 align:start position:0%
would the guidelines incorporate as a
contributing

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
contributing
 
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.189 align:start position:0%
contributing
factor

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
factor
 
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that there were multiple
 
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
incidences and that that would
 
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.309 align:start position:0%
incidences and that that would
presumably

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
presumably
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
change the uh the interpretation of what
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
part of the range to be on and and we
 
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
did not have that conversation but i i'd
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
like to just make sure we all are in an
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
agreement and that statute would support
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
what we're thinking
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
representative lynn do you have
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
something to add here
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i i i do and i uh in two two
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
regards one um
 
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
as you point out we didn't discuss that
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
but yesterday in the work group
 
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.270 align:start position:0%
but yesterday in the work group
um

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
we you know we did sort of focus on this
 
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.350 align:start position:0%
we you know we did sort of focus on this
and

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
and i think our thinking at the time
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday was
 
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
that the definite for definitional
 
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
purposes it was okay to say a single
 
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
incident because as you point out a
 
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
single incident should be enough to to
 
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.309 align:start position:0%
single incident should be enough to to
trigger

00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
trigger
 
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 align:start position:0%
invoking the process
 
00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:34.710 align:start position:0%
invoking the process
i

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
we thought that the way
 
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
to to
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
to make it
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
the concern we had yesterday was to make
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
it clear that
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
whether there was a single incident or
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
multiple incidents
 
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
the cap
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
applied as a cumulative matter in other
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
words you well somebody couldn't come in
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
and say well i was
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
i was sexually assaulted ten times so
 
00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
therefore i'm entitled to
 
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know receive receive the cap for
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
each one of those so 10 times 1.5
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
million so we put some language in
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 5 to cover that
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
but as you pointed out could you do page
 
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
in line sure on on page uh
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
on page four
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
line nine lines nine through twelve
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
we added some language
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh indic you know indicating that the
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
cap that the cap for both
 
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
and the lower cap for physical abuse
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
only applies in the aggregate to all
 
00:08:35.839 --> 00:08:37.750 align:start position:0%
only applies in the aggregate to all
claims

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
claims
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
so we
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
we thought we had covered it but as you
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
raised as you pointed out to me earlier
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
before we actually started our meeting
 
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.790 align:start position:0%
before we actually started our meeting
it

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
arguably it's it
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
it has not completely covered because
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
we we did not focus on the situation of
 
00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:56.230 align:start position:0%
we we did not focus on the situation of
suppose

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
somebody suppose the guidelines were to
 
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.310 align:start position:0%
somebody suppose the guidelines were to
say

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
some form of physical abuse let's say
 
00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:05.350 align:start position:0%
some form of physical abuse let's say
uh

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
would would be worth
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
let's i'm just making this number up but
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
let's say they said some form of
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
physical abuse would be worth ten
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.389 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
and

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
then suppose that so it's under well
 
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
under the cap but suppose there were ten
 
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
incidents of physical abuse of that kind
 
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
would that mean that automatically the
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
number was
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
ten times you know ten thousand dollars
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
times ten um i think
 
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.350 align:start position:0%
times ten um i think
um

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
while the guideline while while the
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
guidelines may
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
make factor in the number
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
of time you know the amount of the abuse
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
or the number of times it occurs i i
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
think there was some concern that it
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't just be automatic so you had
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
suggested i think some language
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
um that i don't exactly
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
i don't remember the exact
 
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
language that you suggested but i think
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
it was a good way to handle it
 
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
so so my thought on on tweaking the
 
00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:03.509 align:start position:0%
so so my thought on on tweaking the
definition

00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
definition
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
was so that we don't violate the idea
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
that a single incident on its own is
 
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.470 align:start position:0%
that a single incident on its own is
sufficient

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
to to say physical abuse means
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
a a single incident incident
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
and then add or multiple incidents
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
with an s
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
the my my thought there is that if
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
a a person is victimized effectively the
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
same way with a you know a beating
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that we would want to
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
have one claim filed and not
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
eight x claims
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
or whatever the number is so so attorney
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
general formella we've not talked about
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
this at all and so
 
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.870 align:start position:0%
this at all and so
um

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
what what are your thoughts on how this
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
term single incident does that really
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
invite the plaintiffs to file one claim
 
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:02.710 align:start position:0%
invite the plaintiffs to file one claim
per

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
per
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for the question
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
i don't have a concern about that
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
reason being that the term claim
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
is defined as a request for compensation
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
related to one or more incidents
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
of sexual abuse and or physical abuse so
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
the way we've defined the term claim as
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
one or more incidents
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh would alleviate i think for me at
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
least the concern that defining physical
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
abuse as a single incident of conduct or
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse as a
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
single incident of conduct it alleviates
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
the concern that that definition might
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
lead to the thought that you could
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
file eight claims for eight incidents i
 
00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:53.829 align:start position:0%
file eight claims for eight incidents i
think

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
one person
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
one claimant only gets one claim and
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
that claim may cover multiple incidents
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
but the way claim is defined it says one
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
or more
 
00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.269 align:start position:0%
or more
so

00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know i i think that
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to say means a single
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
incident or multiple incidents if you
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to add or multiple incidents in
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
physical abuse and sexual abuse i don't
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
see a concern with that i think it might
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
be extra bootstrapping but i
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it's necessary the way i
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
read the language i i read the intent
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
and claimants counsel may be able to
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
speak to this but i read the intent of
 
00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
adding single incident as just trying to
 
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
confirm that
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
one single incident would be enough to
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
establish physical abuse or one single
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
incident would be enough
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
to establish sexual abuse i think
 
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
the cap language that representative lin
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned also gets to this concern
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
because i think that's still
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
i mean it says 1.5 million dollars for
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
all claims
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
so even if someone then tried to submit
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
multiple claims based on multiple
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
incidents that each
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
it's 1.5 million dollars for all claims
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
so or 100 for all and 150 000 for all
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
physical abuse only claims
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
so your position is the definitions fine
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
as is we don't need to tweak it any
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
further that would be my position uh i'm
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
going to ask um the uh mr hayden or or
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
mr dean dean right
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
to come up in a moment but
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
representative weiler do you have a
 
00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:29.670 align:start position:0%
representative weiler do you have a
question

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.430 align:start position:0%
question
so

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
i thought we were the physical injuries
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
to ones that were
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
dealt with with medical care
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
and you know we'd likely have somebody
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
come in and say i was there the guy
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
named coach woke me up by slapping me in
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
the face
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's a hundred times i mean we'll have
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative i think to answer that
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
question i would say i think the intent
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
is to address that in the guidelines i
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.710 align:start position:0%
 
whether

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
something required medical care or not
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
would be considered as we as we craft
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
so mr
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
tatum or hate him hate him right not
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
tatum uh and mr dean um you're you're
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
welcome to speak you're not obligated to
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
speak on this
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
so i yeah i mean i think we agree with
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh representative lin and the attorney
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
general that no change is needed here
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think we ever contemplated that
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
there would be more than one claim filed
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
you know i guess i will just state
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know our our clients would
 
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.870 align:start position:0%
you know our our clients would
uh

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
be less inclined to use the process
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
where there's some kind of devaluing
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
of subsequent injuries or subsequent
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
abuses so
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know when we're talking about
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
somebody that has undergone
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
you know abuse a dozen times severe
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
beatings a dozen times
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
the thought that you know the 12th
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
beating is worth less than the first
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
beating would be would be problematic
 
00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.110 align:start position:0%
beating would be would be problematic
but

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
um but yes i mean i think we're in
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
agreement that each claimant files one
 
00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:34.310 align:start position:0%
agreement that each claimant files one
claim

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
claim
 
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.189 align:start position:0%
claim
and

00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
while we don't agree with your caps we
 
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
we understand that uh
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
that that's where this subcommittee is
 
00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:41.749 align:start position:0%
that that's where this subcommittee is
so

00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
mr hayden do you agree yeah okay he's
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
nods his head yes is there any comment
 
00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:47.829 align:start position:0%
nods his head yes is there any comment
from

00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
so so i think we can move on i'm sorry
 
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative mooney thank you mr
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
chairman uh just to point your attention
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
to page 3
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
line 25
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
the frequency and duration of those acts
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
is very clearly stated as part of the
 
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
formula for valuing claims
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
so i just wouldn't want that to
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
be in contradiction with the word single
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:25.990 align:start position:0%
 
me

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know since representative lynn
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
do you want to respond to representative
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
mooney since you have a mic in front of
 
00:16:31.279 --> 00:16:32.389 align:start position:0%
mooney since you have a mic in front of
you

00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
no i mean i agree with i agree i think
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
that that should address the concerns
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
that uh i mean the point that was raised
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
uh by by uh council because um
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
i mean i i think i think this this
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme will contemplate that
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
that you know the the frequency of the
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
of abuse um would be a would be a factor
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
that would go into valuing
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
valuing claims and as as it should i
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
mean i think that that that
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be you know
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
something that that that obviously
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
should be the case and i think we we
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
captured here
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
i you know i i think we do understand
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
that point um that it would be an
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
aggravating factor
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
um but it you know it does give more
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
discretion to the administrator to
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
to vary and potentially to um
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
put less value on subsequent harm to
 
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.750 align:start position:0%
put less value on subsequent harm to
somebody

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
and that's you know that's just a
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
concern that we would like to raise
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
i i think conceivably it could work the
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
other way too that there'd be an
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
exponential increase you know for each
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
one but i i i don't know i'm not the
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
administrator we'll go with uh
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
representative rogers and then
 
00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:45.750 align:start position:0%
representative rogers and then
representative

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know if this is
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
the time to do this but i'm going to
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
bring it up
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
i'm still concerned that the definitions
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
of abuse do not include
 
00:17:56.799 --> 00:17:57.909 align:start position:0%
of abuse do not include
the

00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse endangerment the false
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
imprisonment that we talked about the
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
other day and i didn't know if there was
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
any um
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
thought given to including those other
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
types of abuse that we all agree are
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
abused but we're not put in here and i
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
guess that would be to
 
00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.789 align:start position:0%
guess that would be to
um

00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
judge lynn and our attorney for mello
 
00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:20.710 align:start position:0%
judge lynn and our attorney for mello
so

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
i'll ask uh attorney general formello to
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
come up and we should figure this out so
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
that because
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
we i i'm viewing the plaintiff and the
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
attorney general you're sort of a team
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
you're like two sides of the same coin
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
so bouncing you back and forth
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
if we could figure out a way if you're
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
all comfortable sitting near the same
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
whatever he feel comfortable with we're
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
still in a
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
do you remember representative rogers
 
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.230 align:start position:0%
do you remember representative rogers
comment

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
yes i i believe the question comment was
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
just whether
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
consideration had been given to
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
including things such as
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse i think the solitary
 
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.310 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse i think the solitary
confinement

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
confinement
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
and other
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
categories of conduct such as that
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
within physical abuse
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
i guess i would answer that just just to
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
say that
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
kind of going to just echo what i've
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
said before um
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
we we we have considered that and we
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
really we really have thought long and
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
hard about that we've been
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
thinking about this you know not just
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
during the discussions on this bill but
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of conversations both
 
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
internally and with claimants council
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
before the bill ever
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
ever got introduced and i
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's really just a matter of where where
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
you cross that threshold to a point
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
where it's just very hard to verify
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
claims and i think that
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know emotional abuse for
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
for events that took place long ago
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know these are already very it's
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
already it's difficult enough i think to
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
go back and kind of suss out um
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
what happened with regard to sexual
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
abuse and even harder with physical
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
abuse i think once you start getting
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
into things like emotional abuse and
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
intentional affliction of emotion
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
emotional distress
 
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.710 align:start position:0%
emotional distress
that's

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
those types of claims
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
arise from actions that
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
you know it wouldn't just be about
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
verifying whether whether the stated
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
actions happen whether statements were
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
made but it's also in the eye of the
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
beholder and it depends on depends on
 
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.510 align:start position:0%
beholder and it depends on depends on
the

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
the perspective you know the perspective
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
resident at ydc may be different than a
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
staff member when it comes to something
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
that could inflict
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
say emotional abuse or emotional
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
distress so
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
we really have thought long and hard
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
from my perspective it's it's not a
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
matter of saying that that isn't
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
potentially serious conduct or doesn't
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
potentially have a serious impact on a
 
00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:01.110 align:start position:0%
potentially have a serious impact on a
resident

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
resident
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's just so difficult to go back and
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
and really make a determination as to
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
what is or is not emotional abuse
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
that that i think it
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
those difficulties weren't leaving it
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
out of the definition for the for the
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of a process like this which is
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
meant to be you know very victim
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
centered in trauma
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
trauma informed so not meant to be a
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
real a really uh
 
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.230 align:start position:0%
real a really uh
difficult

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
and uh probing examination of of the
 
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
facts when it comes to solitary
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
confinement we do include that as an
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
aggregating factor
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
but again
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
the fact is is that solitary confinement
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
was an accepted
 
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.909 align:start position:0%
was an accepted
uh

00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
accepted way to
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
an accepted form of punishment if you
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
will and and i'm not going to make a
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
comment on whether it was
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
a good practice whether it ever should
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
have been the practice but it was a
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
common accepted practice and
 
00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.990 align:start position:0%
common accepted practice and
to

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
i think to have
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
to have this process include claims
 
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.630 align:start position:0%
to have this process include claims
that

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
don't have physical abuse don't have
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse only involve solitary
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
confinement i think i think you're you'd
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
be opening up the process to a lot of
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of former residents
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
that might have gone through ydc and
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
there might have been a reason they were
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
in solitary confinement
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
it'd be very difficult to to
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
differentiate the impacts among
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
residents so i
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know those are just all the things
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
we've thought about at least from my
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
perspective as attorney general the
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
department of justice when we thought
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
about whether to include those
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
include those categories of conduct
 
00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.070 align:start position:0%
include those categories of conduct
within

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
physical abuse for purposes of this
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
process because this is meant to be
 
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.230 align:start position:0%
process because this is meant to be
a

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
a trauma-informed process that will not
 
00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:51.029 align:start position:0%
a trauma-informed process that will not
involve

00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
involve
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
very intense probing and examination
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
so would you remind the committee that
 
00:22:59.530 --> 00:22:59.540 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.190 align:start position:0%
about the
[Music]

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
the due process that we understand was
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
involved in making a solitary
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
confinement decision yes so my
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
understanding of how the process would
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
work is that there would be there would
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
be a committee that would make
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
a committee
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
at the facility that would make
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
determinations on punishment when
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
when there were acts committed that
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
might warrant punishment and that
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
committee would determine whether
 
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
someone spent time in solitary
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
confinement or not
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
i will say you know i certainly can't
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
comment on whether there were times when
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
a when a resident was put in solitary
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
confinement without going through that
 
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
process there i imagine there may have
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
been times when that happened but that
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
those would be those would be difficult
 
00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:45.039 align:start position:0%
to verify and difficult to go back and
 
00:23:45.039 --> 00:23:47.110 align:start position:0%
to verify and difficult to go back and
reconstruct

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
reconstruct
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rogers did you
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up um
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
well i i just again to state that i'm
 
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.230 align:start position:0%
well i i just again to state that i'm
concerned

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
um that we're leaving some of this out
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
and especially the solitary confinement
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
i understand the difficulties but um
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
we've been pointed out instances that
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
were people in in solitary confinement
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
for egregious amounts of time and we've
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
seen studies that also show the effect
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
on a child with this so
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
while i understand that it's difficult i
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
just think that we're being very
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
close-minded if you will
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
by not expanding it some but i'll
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
leave it at that for now
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
do you have a
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
question to
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
to add to that follow-up or
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
is that just your ear
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
you know ask if in fact
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
it was practiced to leave people in
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
there for six months which we have
 
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
incidences of
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
i i it's hard for me to hear you i think
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
if you got the mic closer to your mouth
 
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
it would also
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
and maybe the attorney he said that it
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
was common practice but is it common
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
practice to leave someone in there for
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
six months and i think you know the
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
acceptance of it was that an accepted
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
national standard was an accepted local
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
standard when we say acceptance who was
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
it accepted
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
by so so i i think that's a
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
fair question that would be answered in
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
a totally different process than what
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
we're trying to set up here
 
00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.669 align:start position:0%
we're trying to set up here
okay

00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:17.679 --> 00:25:19.070 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative leishman i think you were
 
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.070 align:start position:0%
representative leishman i think you were
next

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
uh thanks mr chairman just like to take
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative mooney's
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
question a little bit further again
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
going to line 27
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
is there a need to say single we've
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
talked about whether it says single or
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
multiple and just say an incident period
 
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
without saying multiple or single
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
the language i think originated with the
 
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs and and so single is in there
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
out of respect for their input but if if
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
either of you have a comment on
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
well i think it was previously expressed
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
that we do want it to be clear that a
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
single incident is sufficient to bring a
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
claim to the process we just we want
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
that clarification
 
00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:16.149 align:start position:0%
that clarification
okay

00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chairman i i i would be
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
happier if it just said an incident and
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
we made a ann and we struck through
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
single but
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
but that's that's just me is i hear
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative weiler just voicing some
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
support for that
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
is there is there any i i hate reopening
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
this up though so
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
why don't we hang on to that and maybe
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
we could do it if there's other things
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
that need to
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
open up this
 
00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up representative
 
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.909 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up representative
leashman

00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
leashman
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative hatch and then
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
representative walls
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh question answer thank you mr chair
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
representative walls
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i want to go back and revisit the
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
whole issue of solitary confinement
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
particularly in light of what our fine
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
attorney general has said
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
and you know i suspect this actually is
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
one of the areas where there are
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
probably the clearest records more than
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse or physical abuse
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
if you put somebody in solitary campaign
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
for a number of months that probably is
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
still in their record from when the time
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
that they were incarcerated
 
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.310 align:start position:0%
that they were incarcerated
and

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
you know i think
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
the question of what was the standard is
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
something that can be answered during
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
the hearings but it can't be answered if
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
we don't put it in here if we don't make
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement an issue not an
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
aggravating factor and given the data
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's out there on the literal
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
destruction of one's brain by being put
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
in solitary confinement i think it
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
should be a stand-alone cause not just a
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
a little confused by the suggestion that
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
there isn't information on it because i
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
suspect there's information on this even
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
more than the other claims
 
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm very concerned that we're taking
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
something that could have been so
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
harmful to these kids and not including
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
it in this
 
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
so so i'll respond to that and then
 
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative weiler uh can can speak
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
next i am
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
my thought on that is that if there was
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
an adjudicated decision to incarcer or
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
to put somebody in solitary confinement
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
for any period of time
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
to especially if it was an extended
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
um that that there probably is a record
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
of that but the challenge i'm seeing to
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
this though
 
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.870 align:start position:0%
this though
is

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
that we're opening up claims that go
 
00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:50.559 align:start position:0%
back as far as possible and
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
i just don't know i honestly don't know
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
what what is the data retention period
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
for these files i mean if at some point
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
some good administrator might have
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
started throwing out files after they
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
were 10 15 years old
 
00:29:06.799 --> 00:29:07.669 align:start position:0%
were 10 15 years old
and

00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
would we create the presumption
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
of guilt on the part of the state
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
if we can't produce a record because the
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
record was destroyed in sort of the
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
ordinary book bookkeeping of records
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
i i'm sympathetic to solitary
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
confinement being severe abuse but i i i
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
don't know how we can expect this the
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
state to represent exactly what took
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
place when we're dealing with things so
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
long ago that that's just my um
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
that's just my response to what you're
 
00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:42.990 align:start position:0%
that's just my response to what you're
thinking

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.310 align:start position:0%
thinking
[Music]

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
so i i would suggest that issue is going
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
to occur with all these kinds of abuse
 
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
when you go back far enough physical
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
abuse sexual abuse and solitary
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
confinement you're going to be on equal
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
footing for trying to prove or not prove
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
or find records of or not find records
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
of i think you're more likely to find
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
records of solitary confinement than of
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
anything else but i think if the claim
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
is old enough they also
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
could suffer from what you say and that
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
is a destruction of records and so i'm
 
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
not sure why solitary confinement should
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
be treated differently than any other
 
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wyler
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
i'm not in favor of
 
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
having solitary confinement be something
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
that should be paid as its damages
 
00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.269 align:start position:0%
that should be paid as its damages
if

00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
you've got things to read and you've got
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
homework to do and all that kind of
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
thing it's it's almost a welcome
 
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
sense of privacy and so on and i don't
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
know whether that's available or not but
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
i also look at the secure housing unit
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
up at the prison where people are in for
 
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
years solitary confinement 23 hours a
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
day all the time i don't want to make a
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
precedent saying oh that's so damaging
 
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
that we're going to pay you big bucks
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
because they'd be lined up at the door
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to support solitary
 
00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.630 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to support solitary
confinement

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
confinement
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
i i believe we took a straw vote on this
 
00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
issue uh two days ago and and this is
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
good discussion but i i think it's
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
settled at the committee level uh unless
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
there's anyone who
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
wants another strava we can certainly do
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
that i'd like another straw
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
requests another straw vote um
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
again this is going to be with division
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
one and division three members if you're
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
on division two please withhold your
 
00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:30.950 align:start position:0%
on division two please withhold your
vote

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative umberger do you have
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
something to say
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this is to
 
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.190 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this is to
this

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.950 align:start position:0%
this
process

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
take care of the sexual and physical
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
at the ydc whatever
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
cenudo center i don't care where it is
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
it was not to take care of every ill
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
that might have been
 
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.310 align:start position:0%
that might have been
perpetrated

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
perpetrated
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
on a person that is in there
 
00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.389 align:start position:0%
on a person that is in there
if

00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:07.670 align:start position:0%
this doesn't cover
 
00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:08.870 align:start position:0%
this doesn't cover
[Music]

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
whatever it is
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
the person has the opportunity to go to
 
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.350 align:start position:0%
the person has the opportunity to go to
court

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
just like in this process
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
if you don't like the decision of the
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
ag designee
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
you can back off and go to court
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
and so if someone
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
thinks that
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement is
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
you know the horrendous problem
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing else associated with
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
it then they can go to court
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
if solitary confinement was part of
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse or physical abuse
 
00:32:47.919 --> 00:32:49.269 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse or physical abuse
and

00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
they don't like the ag's
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
designated decision they can still go to
 
00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.269 align:start position:0%
designated decision they can still go to
court

00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
we have opened this up significantly
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
from when we first started
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
to where you get the first decision
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
and then you make the decision
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
whether to go to the administrator
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
or to go to court
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.230 align:start position:0%
and so
if

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
i just feel
 
00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.350 align:start position:0%
i just feel
that

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.110 align:start position:0%
that
if

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
if that's what you want to
 
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
go after the state for then you do it
 
00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.509 align:start position:0%
go after the state for then you do it
through

00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
the court system
 
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
and not through this system which is to
 
00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.470 align:start position:0%
and not through this system which is to
help

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
in some small way
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
for the state to provide
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
recompense for
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
whatever happened
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so uh we're gonna have a
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
straw vote um there's gonna be two
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities to vote the first one will
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
be you'll raise your hand if you are in
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
favor of adding solitary confinement to
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.470 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
and the second vote will be
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
if you are opposed to adding solitary
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
confinement to the bill i'll i'll i'll
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
be voting for the second time
 
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.869 align:start position:0%
be voting for the second time
so

00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see a show of hands and mr
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
clerk if you'll help me count
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh raise your hand if you think we
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
should add solitary confinement as a
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
reason in and of itself to file a claim
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
in favor is five and then please raise
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
your hand if you're opposed to adding
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
so so we have a
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
five to eight vote which means that the
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
straw vote failed and we will not be
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay i i think we'll get through the
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
other pages a little faster
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
but that was uh that was page one and i
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
think the definitional issues are really
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
key so so i i think that was time well
 
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.910 align:start position:0%
key so so i i think that was time well
spent

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
spent
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh there's nothing on there are no
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
recommended changes on page two i don't
 
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
think oh wait a second mr hoffman i'll
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
shut up and let you take it
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
beginning on line 29
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
this language was changed and i can read
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
it or if the committee would prefer not
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
to hear my voice
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
we can pause and and and the members can
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
i uh i completed reading it and and my
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
lips were moving while i was doing it so
 
00:36:25.839 --> 00:36:26.790 align:start position:0%
lips were moving while i was doing it so
um

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
so everyone should have read this by now
 
00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.069 align:start position:0%
so everyone should have read this by now
uh

00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
mr hoffman do you want to explain to us
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
well there really uh there are a couple
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
pieces here there's the
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
agreement on the administrator the
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
appointment of the administrator and if
 
00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.710 align:start position:0%
appointment of the administrator and if
the

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
designee or the attorney general and the
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
council don't agree then the supreme
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
court would
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
choose an administrator from a
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
a list of candidates two each provided
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
and then make it a decision within 30
 
00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:06.950 align:start position:0%
and then make it a decision within 30
days

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
and then starting at the bottom on
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
line 35 it talks about the compensation
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
of the administrative
 
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.510 align:start position:0%
of the administrative
administrator

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're full-time or
 
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
so i believe we talked about this quite
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
a lot on tuesday is there any new
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
okay so let's let's move on to what
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
representative von berger i'm i'm sorry
 
00:37:37.359 --> 00:37:43.109 align:start position:0%
representative von berger i'm i'm sorry
um

00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it doesn't seem to say in
 
00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.990 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it doesn't seem to say in
here

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
when the administrator needs to be
 
00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.870 align:start position:0%
when the administrator needs to be
appointed

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
but later on he has responsibility
 
00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.310 align:start position:0%
but later on he has responsibility
to

00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.829 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
do something starting one november
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
in other places we have said
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know the ag and we'll get together
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
and do the guidelines and we'll do this
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
and do that
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
but i am concerned that we don't have
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
a timeline
 
00:38:22.079 --> 00:38:23.589 align:start position:0%
a timeline
for

00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
the administrator
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
that says the administrator will be
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
appointed by one october or 15 october
 
00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.270 align:start position:0%
appointed by one october or 15 october
or

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
29 october but it needs to be before
 
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.109 align:start position:0%
29 october but it needs to be before
the

00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
claims can be filed which is when
 
00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.630 align:start position:0%
claims can be filed which is when
november

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
november
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise we can't get the data out
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
unless i'm unless i'm missing something
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
someplace but
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
do you think that that needs to be
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
incorporated into this document or that
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
the fact that there's a hiring authority
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
in here that they have the flexibility
 
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
to do something rational and hire them
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
in advance
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
do you want it in here i have no problem
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
as long as the ag and the
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
and the plaintiff's council
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
recognize that this is something that
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
will have to be done
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
as a first step i think
 
00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:20.390 align:start position:0%
as a first step i think
do

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
do either of you
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
want to comment on this and by either i
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
mean the two of you are are one so yeah
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
i i i think the way i look at it is
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
given that the
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
the deadline to kick off the process by
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
publishing notice is november 1. i think
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
that kind of provides a deadline to get
 
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
the guidelines negotiated and approved
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
and then the administrator appointed
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
in time to meet that november one
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
deadline of publishing notice and
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
kicking everything off so i think there
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
is a deadline in here and i think we
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
would know that we've got a we've gotta
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
get things done quickly enough so that
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
we can ultimately meet that november
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
so um from from our standpoint you know
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
this process once it's once the
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
guidelines have been established
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
can't happen fast enough for us so we
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
have every incentive to
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
get past the guidelines as well as pick
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
an administrator in a timely fashion so
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
i don't see that
 
00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:22.839 align:start position:0%
a deadline is
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
necessary all right so i i i'd really
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
like to not open this document back up
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
and so i'm not seeing a compelling
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
reason to do that thank you i don't i'm
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
not excited about that either okay
 
00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.270 align:start position:0%
not excited about that either okay
i'm

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
glad we share a common sense of apathy
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
uh all right so mr hoffman i think we're
 
00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:44.950 align:start position:0%
uh all right so mr hoffman i think we're
on

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
page three
 
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.670 align:start position:0%
page three
line

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.030 align:start position:0%
line
eighteen

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
eighteen
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
oh wait a second representative emerick
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to comment this says per
 
00:40:54.319 --> 00:40:55.910 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to comment this says per
diem

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
diem
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
per diem is seven and a half hours
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
for the majority of classified employees
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
it is 37 and a half hours there are
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
different jobs that are 40 hour
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
work weeks
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
okay i i'm
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
i don't have a
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
dog in the hunt here i'm just saying is
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
it is it
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
which part of the state's per diem
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
what line are you on
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh page three line two
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
so he's just questioning what the
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
definition of per diem is in this
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
context is a 37 and a half hours or i
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
would have i would have assumed it was
 
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.550 align:start position:0%
would have i would have assumed it was
40.

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
40.
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
i would assume an eight-hour day but i
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
just wanted to
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
throw it out there just just to make
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:02.079 --> 00:42:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're taxing my memory on
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
this a little bit but i think
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
i think that the way
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch would conta would
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
would would consider the per diem rate
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
for let's say a superior court judge
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
i think that they would say
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
you know this in the
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
these are the work days during the year
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
and you know so in other words it
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't include it wouldn't include
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
weekends it wouldn't include holidays
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
whatever and whatever that you know 365
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
minus those days are the work days
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
during the year and then you and then i
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
believe they divide that by the judge's
 
00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
yearly salary and say that's the per
 
00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.430 align:start position:0%
yearly salary and say that's the per
diem

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
diem
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
rate for a judge for a day and so i
 
00:42:47.839 --> 00:42:48.950 align:start position:0%
rate for a judge for a day and so i
assume

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
assume
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
that that's that that's the way
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
they would they would do it you know
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's the way they would interpret this
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
okay i is there anyone on the committee
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't want it to be assumed to be
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
an eight-hour day is what's our intent
 
00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
here we we want it to be an eight-hour
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
day right
 
00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.190 align:start position:0%
day right
anyone

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.430 align:start position:0%
anyone
yes

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
so i you know i don't again i don't know
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
if we need to open up the language to
 
00:43:13.359 --> 00:43:15.910 align:start position:0%
if we need to open up the language to
that

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
no no
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i
 
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think so just because it says it
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
okay so i was talking we decided to do
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
nothing about that so
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
yes the work group modified this
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
language to read
 
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
the attorney general after making good
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
faith efforts to reach agreements with
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
the claimant's counsel
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
and with input from the attorney
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
general's victim witness
 
00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:52.870 align:start position:0%
general's victim witness
advocates

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
advocates
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
shall develop and present
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
the claims process
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
so i think the shaded language was
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
from what was in the original bill and
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how that ties in with the
 
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh plaintiff attorney's suggestion so so
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
the point here was we we just wanted to
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
make sure there was a line of
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
accountability and the prior writing was
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
the joint
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility between plaintiffs and
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
the attorney general so i i think this
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
language achieves what we said we wanted
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
to do two days ago
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
is is there any disagreement on that do
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
we do we want to open this up for more
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
discussion or move on
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing anyone wanting to talk
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
further about this so so let's go down
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the page is shaded to
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
indicate that there was a
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
a suggestion
 
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
by a plaintiff's counsel
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
to have the appointment of a mediator to
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
resolve disputes and and that language
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
again i think we talked about this two
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
days ago and this is consistent with the
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
straw votes are there any is there any
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
new information or new perspectives to
 
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.870 align:start position:0%
new information or new perspectives to
share

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
share
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not seeing any so mr hoffman
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
would you take us the next item please
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
next item is on page four starting on
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
line nine
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
and it reads
 
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
for all claims involving both sexual and
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
physical physical abuse
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
or sexual abuse only
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
no individual no individual claimant
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
shall be paid more than
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
one million five hundred thousand
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
dollars in settlement of all claims in
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
the ag in the aggregate
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
for claims involving physical abuse only
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
no individual claimant shall be paid
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
more than 150 000
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
in settlement of all physic
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
so i have a math question to ask the
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
attorney general if if uh that's
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
dangerous yeah if um
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
if somebody came in
 
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
and they their
 
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
violation was so grievous on the sexual
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
abuse area and they got the 1.5 million
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
but then they had a standalone set of
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
physical abuse only claims
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
would would
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
the total amount that they could be
 
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
compensated be the 1.5 million or
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
1.65 million because you would take the
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i think the total would be 1.5
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
million because the 1.5 million is the
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
cap for all claims the 150 000 is meant
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
to just apply to all physical abuse
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
physical abuse
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
only claims or all physical abuse claims
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
so um the 150 000 cap is really just
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
meant to apply to that claimant who
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
comes forward with only physical abuse
 
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.109 align:start position:0%
comes forward with only physical abuse
claims

00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else with the question
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
on that i
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
so mister i'm not seeing any mr hoffman
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
oh wait oh
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
i don't do that on on purpose it's just
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's hard to see you back there so uh so
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative rogers please go ahead
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
yeah the i know we talked about it the
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
other day and you don't want to reopen
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
it but
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
is going to be a a
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
reason for the plaintiffs not to come
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
forward and go through the settlement
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
process and instead going to court we do
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
know that there are
 
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.069 align:start position:0%
know that there are
um

00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
there was an average taken but average
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't really reflect in a situation
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
there have been much larger settlements
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
that have been smaller
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
around the country for um
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
similar kind of things and i'm just
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
asking the attorney general
 
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
is there a reason you don't share any
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
concern that this i know we want to get
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
as many people to go through this
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
process as possible
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
and recently we found
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
in some of the case the more infamous
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
cases around the country
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
of this kind of thing have been much
 
00:48:16.559 --> 00:48:18.950 align:start position:0%
of this kind of thing have been much
larger

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
larger
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
agreements or settlements and my concern
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
again is that um
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
for for trying to do an average because
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
as i said averages on this you can take
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
an average but each case is different
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
each document is different each person
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
is different so i don't think an average
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
really reflects so
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
you don't have any concern that people
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
are not going to
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
go forward because of the fact that
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
we've capped
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative um
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
i i think the first point i would i
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
would say in response is that the
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
the average that we identified if you'll
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
recall but i know it was a few meetings
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
ago was
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
you know somewhere between 500 and 550
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per claimant that that
 
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
was the the average we identified when
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
we looked at
 
00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:09.829 align:start position:0%
we looked at
um

00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
past uh verdicts and settlements so
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
this cap of 1.5 million just to start
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's quite a bit higher than even
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
that national average we identified
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
i think our goal would be to
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
through the development of the
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines design a process where our
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
average fell
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
you know roughly around within that
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
range so not
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
not too much higher than 500 to 550 000
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
which what each claimant would end up
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
getting at the end of the day but
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
this cap
 
00:49:42.309 --> 00:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
does provide room for
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh a payment to an individual claimant
 
00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.270 align:start position:0%
uh a payment to an individual claimant
of

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
of significantly over the national
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
average that we identified at least for
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
claims that involve sexual and physical
 
00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.309 align:start position:0%
claims that involve sexual and physical
abuse

00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned i think last time
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
based on our research you know the the
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
average for physical abuse claims we
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
identified was six between 65 and 75 000
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
per claimant so the 150 000 cap does
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
allow for going you know significantly
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
above that and for particular claims
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
within this process so
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
so i would just note that as as a first
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
point in response to your concern
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
the second point you raise
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's a fair one and it's a good one
 
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:25.839 align:start position:0%
and i think yes i have thought about the
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
by having a cap of 1.5 million
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
for all claims 150 000 for physical
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
abuse claims i think there is a
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
possibility and it's probably almost a
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
certainty that there will be some
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
claimants who
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
who feel they have a case or who who
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
have been harmed who have suffered abuse
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
who might feel that they have a case
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's worth more than these caps and
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
and they may decide to go to court
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
i think that that's that's okay i mean i
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
think our our goal has been to provide
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
an alternative process that
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
that offers a quicker and smoother path
 
00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.150 align:start position:0%
that offers a quicker and smoother path
to

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
to resolution the trade-off being in
 
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
some cases it may be less money than you
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
could expect if you go to court
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
i i would expect that
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
most will take that option but i've
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
always had the expectation and i think
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
we all i don't want to speak for
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
everyone here but i think we all do i've
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
always had the expectation that there
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
may be a small percentage who who would
 
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
not elect that option so
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
it really is a balance between trying to
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
encourage as many
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
claimants as possible to come through
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
the process but
 
00:51:33.839 --> 00:51:35.349 align:start position:0%
the process but
to

00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
keep the numbers at a at a level that's
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate for a process that doesn't
 
00:51:39.839 --> 00:51:41.109 align:start position:0%
appropriate for a process that doesn't
involve

00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
involve
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
litigation and and verification
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
investigation that traditional
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
litigation would if you go through the
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
traditional litigation process you have
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
a fully litigated fully discovered case
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
by the end of it even if the number's
 
00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:57.750 align:start position:0%
by the end of it even if the number's
big

00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
big
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
you can be more confident i think that
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
you've really gotten to what i'll just
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
say you know you've gotten to the truth
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
the goal of this process is
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
yes to get to the truth but it's the
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
primary goal is for to create a smooth
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
and efficient process that is fair to
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
claimants and gets them compensation for
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
for harm so all that said i apologize
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
for the for the long answer but i just
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
want to give you a sense again of of my
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
thinking on this so
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
um that's those are the factors that
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
went into it the concern you raise
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
yes it's on our mind but we've we have
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
to balance that concern with making sure
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
these values are appropriate for a
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
process like this
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up yeah i have the two i'll
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
ask them both right now so you can do it
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
the the two questions i have for you is
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
what would be the average
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
is it or to get average but the cost to
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
your office in litigating a um
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
a fairly complicated case like one of
 
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.430 align:start position:0%
a fairly complicated case like one of
these

00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
and secondly do you foresee the
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
administrator ever saying to someone
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
that comes forward with a particularly
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
egregious event um saying you really
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
should go to court because we're not
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
going to be able to
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
obligate you know to
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
to deal with this this way because of
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
the cap and so forth if it's something
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
particularly you know that any of us
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
would look at and say this this should
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
get more and i think you're looking at
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
me like i'm crazy about the time i'm
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
just curious um
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i've administrated administered a
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
legal office before and i know there's
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
different ways to break out but i'm just
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
curious what per case when you prosecute
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
these cases how many attorneys how long
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
of their time and and what kind of cost
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
is there to the office and when they say
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
cost i don't mean just the the
 
00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.670 align:start position:0%
cost i don't mean just the the
monetary

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
monetary
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
yep no and trust me i i'm not looking at
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
you like you're crazy just kind of
 
00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
thinking as you talk and so if any
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
facial expressions are more just trying
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
to think about the response everybody
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
thinks i'm crazy
 
00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:55.589 align:start position:0%
thinks i'm crazy
um

00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
so the the first question what's the
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
average cost
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's difficult to pinpoint
 
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.390 align:start position:0%
that's difficult to pinpoint
i

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
meant it's very rare that even when
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
these cases do go to court that they end
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
up going all the way to through trial
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
and they get to a verdict
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
but what might happen when you go to
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
court is that you at least get further
 
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
through discovery you get closer to
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh dispositive motions
 
00:54:25.839 --> 00:54:26.710 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh dispositive motions
and

00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
and you get to a point where you're more
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
comfortable that each side has the
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
information they need to have in order
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
to engage in in settlement discussions
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
i i think on a case like this we were
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
just to take one claimant probably
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
involves a couple of attorneys in our
 
00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.150 align:start position:0%
involves a couple of attorneys in our
office

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.270 align:start position:0%
office
and

00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
i don't have a good sense of how much of
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
their time
 
00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.390 align:start position:0%
their time
um

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
it would take it really it's it's a
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis it just depends on
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
how many records are available how
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
burdensome the discovery is but every
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
attorney in our litigation unit carries
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
a very heavy caseload
 
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
and even a case like this it's just
 
00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.190 align:start position:0%
and even a case like this it's just
and

00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
i don't mean to by saying it's just one
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
more case i don't mean to discount that
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
but it it it's another case in their
 
00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:13.190 align:start position:0%
but it it it's another case in their
caseload

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
caseload
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
so it's very hard to pinpoint what the
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
costs either are in dollars or or
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
attorney time for a case because it just
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
depends but
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
a case like this
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
it it's not insignificant i just don't
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
so we've we've had a similar
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
conversation every hearing and the way i
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
summarize what i think we're doing here
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
is the attorney general
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
and his team has
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
undergone a data-driven process to get
 
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
as much information as they can to
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
inform them
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
knowing that this is something that
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
we've never done before and so
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately this is
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
i think is going to rely on on just best
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
judgment and the humility that we might
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
be wrong but we're trying to get it as
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
right as we can that that
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's my take
 
00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:11.270 align:start position:0%
that's my take
and

00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
i see you shaking your head yeah so i i
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
won't go to you but representative
 
00:56:15.599 --> 00:56:17.109 align:start position:0%
won't go to you but representative
umberger

00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
umberger
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
yes this is uh this is to answer
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
part of one of
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
representative rogers questions she said
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
would the administrator ever tell a
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
person to go to court well the bottom
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
line is that it would never get to the
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
administrator for that decision
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
because the decision needs to be made
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
level and so
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
if the if they decide not to go to go to
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
court then the administrator is really
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
not involved
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative wyler
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
let's not lose
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
sight of the fact it's an experimental
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
process which never been done before
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
we're trying to deal with hundreds of
 
00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.270 align:start position:0%
we're trying to deal with hundreds of
cases

00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
trying to minimize the amount of time it
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
would take
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
to settle them
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
and some of these people are willing to
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
to settle for a lot less than we think
 
00:57:15.359 --> 00:57:16.549 align:start position:0%
to settle for a lot less than we think
and

00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
the idea is to find those and get those
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
cases out of the way obviously we know
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
from the beginning that many will want
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
to go to court the first few it may take
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
three or four years before they get
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
there and then they might have a jury
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
that decides you're getting zero
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
there's always that chance
 
00:57:34.319 --> 00:57:35.589 align:start position:0%
there's always that chance
so

00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
at least by going through this process
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
it's likely you'll get some money
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
so i think a lot of people will look at
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
the odds and say well i want money now
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
and they're just gonna go ahead with
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
this process as proposed and not
 
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
dream of getting becoming an instant
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
millionaire because they're going to
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
court i don't think that will happen i
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
think the first one or two that go all
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
the way to court are going to be sadly
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear a question in there so um
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
i think we're getting ready to move on
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh just for situational awareness
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
the house republicans started their
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
decorum meeting at 3 p.m and so for
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
those of you that are missing it i will
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
give you constructive credit for that as
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
so mr hoffman would you take us to line
 
00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.549 align:start position:0%
so mr hoffman would you take us to line
13

00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
13
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
yes line 13 you'll see the shaded
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
november 1st 2022 that used to read
 
00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
december 1st 2022 provides one extra
 
00:58:37.599 --> 00:58:38.870 align:start position:0%
december 1st 2022 provides one extra
month

00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
an earlier publication of notice so
 
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
there's happens a little sooner
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
all right i'm not
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
seeing any conversation there do you
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
want to go to 34 line 34
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
line 34
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
was added to to read once a claim has
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
been properly filed by a living former
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
ydc resident
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
the subsequent death of that claimant
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
i i think we had a good conversation two
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
days ago on that and that seems to hit
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
what we said is there any
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
discussion on that
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any so
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
if you would take us to page five
 
00:59:23.839 --> 00:59:24.950 align:start position:0%
if you would take us to page five
line

00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:28.630 align:start position:0%

eight

00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
the language here was revised to read by
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
filing a claim the claimant agrees that
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
he or she will participate in the claims
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
process and if the claimant requests
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
that the administrator decide the claim
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
agrees to accept the determination of
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
the administrator as final and binding
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
even if the claimant does not receive
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay so in the past when we've discussed
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
this section um
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
i i i wanted to be sensitive to whether
 
01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
or not the plaintiffs
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
read this language and can accept this
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
is this acceptable to you the way this
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
we believe this is stated properly and
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
consistent with what
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
you know the way this bill is
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
constructed so yes we're fine with it
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
all right thank you um if there's no
 
01:00:25.359 --> 01:00:26.309 align:start position:0%
all right thank you um if there's no
further

01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
discussion or questions uh let's go down
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
line 33 is
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
added reference to the right to know
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
statute 91a
 
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
and that ties in with the
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
discussion later on toward the end of
 
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh regarding the right to
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
all right so let's uh let's defer if
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
there are any questions on that to the
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
other bigger discussion so i think we're
 
01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:00.789 align:start position:0%
other bigger discussion so i think we're
on

01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:01:00.799 --> 01:01:01.829 align:start position:0%
on
line

01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%

01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
this language was added starting on 17.
 
01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.589 align:start position:0%
this language was added starting on 17.
um

01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
would you like me to read it or give
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
everyone a chance to read it uh b let's
 
01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
can you add some context of what the
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
work group attempted to do with this
 
01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:14.870 align:start position:0%
work group attempted to do with this
section

01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
i would defer to the um
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
main participants of the work group
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
mr attorney general
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
yeah this
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
this language was added it actually
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
mirrors language that appears later in
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
the bill but as we were going through
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
the bill yesterday i realized that
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
while later in the bill there's language
 
01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.630 align:start position:0%
while later in the bill there's language
regarding

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
um advising the
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
the claimant of their of their options
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
giving the
 
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
giving the claim in a certain amount of
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
time to indicate their response to the
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
a.g designee's position
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
that language came
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
after a claim was referred to an
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
investigator we didn't have language to
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
address what happens for claims that
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
aren't referred to an investigator so
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
we i just thought we should add the same
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
language to to apply so it applies to
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
claims that aren't that are never
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
referred to an investigator in the first
 
01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.549 align:start position:0%
referred to an investigator in the first
place

01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
just so mr hayden or dean do you do you
 
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
have any comment on this
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna take credit for raising this
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
issue last tuesday and i'm gonna give
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
the attorney general credit for properly
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
wording it in this amendment
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
all right success
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
very nice so let's go
 
01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.309 align:start position:0%
very nice so let's go
to

01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
page 7
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
line 8
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
clarifies that the
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
claimant will be advised in writing
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
instead of withdrawing his or her claim
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any uh do you want to go
 
01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:06.950 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any uh do you want to go
to

01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
line 13 please
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
um there is one more note on that that
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
last one that i missed the work group
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
removed a sentence stating that an
 
01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:18.470 align:start position:0%
removed a sentence stating that an
explanation

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
shall be provided of how the attorney's
 
01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
fees are impacted by resolution process
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
and that was
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
determined to be unnecessary
 
01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
because of the change to the cap on
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
just um
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
would you would you stick my nose into
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
where um the
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh 33 and a third percent what's what
 
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
bill is that on
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
are we going to be reading that later on
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
so so i'll i'll ask that question later
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
yes it is on page nine all right um
 
01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:56.230 align:start position:0%
yes it is on page nine all right um
okay

01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
so we we
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
opened up
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh line eight and ten i don't think we
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
have any comments on those uh
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
do we wanna go are you ready for line
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
that should probably be
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
all of uh subsection 8 should probably
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
be read together with the changes
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
within 30 days of receiving
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
the updated position of the aeg designee
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
the claimant shall indicate to the
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
administrator and the ag designee
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
whether he or she agrees with the ag
 
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
designee's position
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
whether he or she wishes for the
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
administrator to decide the claim
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
or whether he or she wishes to withdraw
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
the claim from further processing
 
01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
in the absence of an indication from the
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
claimant the administrator may assume
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
that the claimant is in agreement with
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
the position of the ag designee
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
if the claimant and the ag designee are
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
in agreement regarding the disposition
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
of the claim
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
the administrator shall make an award
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
does anyone
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
have a question or comment on that
 
01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:11.910 align:start position:0%
have a question or comment on that
section

01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
are is everyone getting enough time to
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
actually have an opportunity to speak up
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
if they see something
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
because we i am trying to move through
 
01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.270 align:start position:0%
because we i am trying to move through
this

01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
but i don't want to override anyone's
 
01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:33.270 align:start position:0%
but i don't want to override anyone's
speaking

01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
i think we're on page eight
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
and we're down to line 17.
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
there was another
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation in the margin
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
next to line 18 on page seven
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
that the work group opted not to include
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
language making the claim and aware in
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
writing of his or her options and the
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
reason for that is the issue was
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
addressed elsewhere
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
when you say elsewhere is it
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
to come still or did we cover that part
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.470 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
it was addressed on page seven line
 
01:07:20.799 --> 01:07:23.750 align:start position:0%
it was addressed on page seven line
eight

01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:37.430 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:41.670 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
i think we have some a change on page
 
01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.430 align:start position:0%
i think we have some a change on page
eight

01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
at um
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
line 17
 
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
i thought we just did that good go ahead
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
thanks for the catch this has to do with
 
01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:11.109 align:start position:0%
thanks for the catch this has to do with
the

01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
situation where there may have been a
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
mathematical error miscalculation
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
it provides that the claimant or the aeg
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
designee may request the administrator
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
to reconsider decision
 
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh based on mathematical mistakes or
 
01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.590 align:start position:0%
uh based on mathematical mistakes or
miscalculations

01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
miscalculations
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.149 align:start position:0%
okay okay
um

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs do you have a comment or
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
concern or anything you want to talk
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
about here that change is fine
 
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
so so now we're at nine nine i sound
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
like a german
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
nine-nine that's the uh
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's the language that deals with the
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh attorney's fees and it reads the
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
administrator shall not approve any
 
01:08:58.239 --> 01:08:59.749 align:start position:0%
administrator shall not approve any
request

01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:09:01.829 --> 01:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
of an attorney fee or costs which are
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
not reasonable
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
the attorney uh the administrator shall
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
not approve
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
an attorney's
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
fee in excess of 33 and a third percent
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
of the amount of the award
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
all costs and attorney fees paid to
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
claim it this attorney shall be paid
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
all right i think we talked about that a
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
good deal tuesday and this is consistent
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
with what we agreed on then so art but
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any new comment or
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
consideration to throw in here
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative weiler did you have
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
something you wanted to say sir
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
i just said we agreed to eliminate 25
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
percent and
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
judge lynn's recommendation make it all
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
33 and a third so there was no incentive
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
to go beyond the first step thank you
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
it is as i understand it it's a little
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
more nuanced than that the 33 and a
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
third percent gets to be the ceiling and
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
the administrator could choose a lower
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
contingency fee depending on what's
 
01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.669 align:start position:0%
contingency fee depending on what's
reasonable

01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly right yes the 33 and a
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
third is the cat is the maximum
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay so let's uh
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
drop down
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
to line 25 i think it's 20.
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
and this is the the language that
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
concerned with the right to know
 
01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.430 align:start position:0%
concerned with the right to know
information

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
the shaded language was agreed to by the
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
committee on tuesday
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
and the new language reads
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
records of the youth development center
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
claims administration in the ydc
 
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
settlement fund pursuant to rsa 21m
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
going 11-a with the exception of
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
settlement agreements which shall remain
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
right to know
 
01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
and after a claim has been finally
 
01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.630 align:start position:0%
and after a claim has been finally
resolved

01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
such other records the release of which
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
would not constitute a violation of the
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
provisions of law or an unwanted
 
01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.110 align:start position:0%
provisions of law or an unwanted
invasion

01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
invasion
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
of a claimant's
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
privacy and the section being amended
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
there are the exemptions to the right to
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
so i think this is consistent with what
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
we talked about on tuesday and i i'm
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
just curious this is more trivia than
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
essential but
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
has has since we've drafted this
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
particular version has anyone heard from
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
the union leader or ms timmins who spoke
 
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay i i
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
we haven't gotten feedback i
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
i this this is this represents to me a
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
good faith effort to address
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
the concerns of the media
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh i may be wrong i'm not a lawyer uh so
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
let's go to line 35.
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
um well i'm sorry representative walner
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
i didn't see you go ahead even though uh
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
i know that there's going to be no
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
change here i
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
we now hit the appropriations line and i
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
know that's not read it's not going to
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
be changed
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
we agreed upon it that last time you
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
brought in the amendment you brought in
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
to take it from the rainy day fund and i
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
just want to remind everybody that there
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
is a very specific way
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
that you go into the rainy day fund and
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's really respond
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
irresponsible of us
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
as the finance committee
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
to have a to have a bill we're
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
presenting to the legislature
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
that spends hundred million dollars
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
without people understanding that we're
 
01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:41.990 align:start position:0%
without people understanding that we're
bypassing

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
bypassing
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
the law that um
 
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
governs the rainy day fund
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
and so i have a copy of the rainy day
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
fund law for everyone
 
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
so that they can review it and we can be
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
certain we understand clearly what we're
 
01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.229 align:start position:0%
certain we understand clearly what we're
doing

01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
it's really a serious situation because
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
taking money from the rainy day fund
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
will affect our bond rating or may
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
affect our bond rating which is going to
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
be a problem in the future
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
so i think i have a copy for everyone
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
and i think i think it's just something
 
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
that we should be sure that people
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
understand what they're doing
 
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
when uh we're on the floor with this
 
01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.590 align:start position:0%
when uh we're on the floor with this
bill

01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate what you're saying and as
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
a relatively junior member of this
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee i i want to hear from people
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
with uh more
 
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
seniority than i have so
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative leishman is your hand up
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
is it or are you just no not yet
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative emmerich representative
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
weiler representative humberger do you
 
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
do you have anything to say here
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
i would i would just say that
 
01:13:56.719 --> 01:13:58.870 align:start position:0%
i would i would just say that
before

01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
um i made the decision to take it from
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund i did look at the
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
at the requirements
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
i'm well aware of them
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
won't argue with you
 
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's difficult
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
and i also know that
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
neil kirk is probably standing right
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
behind me with a big fat bat
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
and no kidding this is where i learned
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
this and uh you know and i i won't deny
 
01:14:30.719 --> 01:14:31.510 align:start position:0%
this and uh you know and i i won't deny
that

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
but i also know that um
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
our rainy day fund is uh
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
higher than it's ever been
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
by about 100 million dollars and so um
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
that that's where you know all that
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
stuff together
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
pointed here
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
now we can we can also um
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know make the assumption
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
that our revenues
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
from 23 and the lapses that occur
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
will be more than
 
01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.229 align:start position:0%
will be more than
100

01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
100
 
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars um
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
i guess it's a flip of a coin
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
as to
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
as to what we do
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think any of us
 
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
no matter how long you've been in the
 
01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.229 align:start position:0%
no matter how long you've been in the
legislature

01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
have ever been in a position
 
01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.430 align:start position:0%
have ever been in a position
where

01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
there is this much money out there and
 
01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
that's not including
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
all the arpa and the cares and all that
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
other stuff that we have been
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
we've been dealing with this is just you
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
know state revenue
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
that i don't we've never
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
i haven't been here forever but i know
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
some of you have
 
01:15:51.679 --> 01:15:52.550 align:start position:0%
some of you have
and

01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
i don't mean i don't that's probably the
 
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
wrong thing to say have been here a lot
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
longer than i have
 
01:15:58.159 --> 01:15:59.430 align:start position:0%
longer than i have
and

01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely unprecedented so
 
01:16:04.239 --> 01:16:05.110 align:start position:0%
absolutely unprecedented so
that's

01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
and i i would agree
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
may i speak go ahead
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
i would
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
sorry about that i would agree that it
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
is the most money probably i've ever
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
seen flowing into the state
 
01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.070 align:start position:0%
seen flowing into the state
but

01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
the time will come when all this arpa
 
01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:21.510 align:start position:0%
the time will come when all this arpa
money

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
cares money all that will dry up and we
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
will be back again to being dependent
 
01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
on our own resources
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
and if the time comes
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
when new hampshire has a financial
 
01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.790 align:start position:0%
when new hampshire has a financial
problem

01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
and we have drained the rainy day fund
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
or we have taken a significant amount
 
01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.229 align:start position:0%
or we have taken a significant amount
out

01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
then we will
 
01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:44.950 align:start position:0%
then we will
have

01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
we will be facing a financial problem
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
and i just think it's something to take
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
very seriously
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
by the members of the finance committee
 
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
will tell you i learned this from a
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
member of your party
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
who um
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
really understood this very well and
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
taught me many times about the
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
importance of the rainy day fund
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
so just i i do want to pass the
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
i want to pass the law out and you've
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
probably all seen it and looked at it
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
but you'll have your own personal copy
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
and you can just bring it out and take a
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
look at it before you go to bed at night
 
01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i've
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
sat in this committee for more than a
 
01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
dozen budgets i've seen the rainy day
 
01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
fund go up and down and i've seen many
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh administrations that as soon as they
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
started the budget process they took
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
almost everything out of the rainy day
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
fund that's not uncommon um
 
01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
i think this is a good idea because of
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
what we heard in discussions from ways
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
and means telling us this 200 million
 
01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.630 align:start position:0%
and means telling us this 200 million
dollars

01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
that we're counting as revenue
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
that is as a result of um
 
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
you know payroll protection plan that
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're forgiving their taxes on as well
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
as credit carry forward
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's getting up over about 100 million
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
so there's what we think of 200 million
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
that we have in revenue
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
is somebody else's money that we're
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
going to likely have to pay back we
 
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
don't know when or over what period of
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
time but
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
when they brought that out to my
 
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
attention i thought whoa we're not
 
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
nearly as far ahead of this revenue as
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
we thought we were so
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
um it's not unusual for us to use rainy
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
day fund usually it doesn't go into the
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
middle of the budget but
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
too often it started the budget by
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
grabbing that money right away so
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's not unusual for money to go in and
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
out of them the
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
and it's unusual for it to come out in
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
the middle but i think it's happened
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
before when we had a mistake on the
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
revenue thank you
 
01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:51.750 align:start position:0%
revenue thank you
so

01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
so i have a question and maybe this is
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
for you representative umberger um
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
as i understand the core of your
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
position it's it's like the rainy day
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
fund is an empty coffee can
 
01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
and we're going to open the bottom of it
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
to pull the 100 million out of this
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
but at the same time we've got
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
a spigot
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
putting 100 million into the top of the
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
can so so net net
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's no effect on the rainy day
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
fund is is that is that a fair
 
01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:26.470 align:start position:0%
fund is is that is that a fair
interpretation

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:27.430 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
the the spigot doesn't open until june
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
of 23
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
at the end of the biennium
 
01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:36.470 align:start position:0%
at the end of the biennium
so

01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.669 align:start position:0%
so
between

01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
whenever this passes and the money comes
 
01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.030 align:start position:0%
whenever this passes and the money comes
out

01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.070 align:start position:0%
out
the

01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund would be short 100
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
million but not short would be a hundred
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars less
 
01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:51.189 align:start position:0%
million dollars less
okay

01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
it would be 100 million less but then
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
we're anticipating 100 million more
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
flowing to the rainy day fund
 
01:19:59.910 --> 01:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to understand what
 
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
you've said yeah a lot you know all i
 
01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
can say is a lot depends
 
01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.310 align:start position:0%
can say is a lot depends
on

01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
how much of the
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
200 and
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
i can't remember the number 200 plus
 
01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.550 align:start position:0%
i can't remember the number 200 plus
million

01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
that is currently in
 
01:20:22.629 --> 01:20:22.639 align:start position:0%
bills that are sitting here in finance
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
how much of that goes
 
01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:25.990 align:start position:0%
how much of that goes
so

01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:30.639 align:start position:0%
as to how much is actually in the um
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
i'll call i don't i'll call it revenue
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
above projections
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
so but yes uh and of course what's not
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
included in that are the lapses
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
and i think all of us know
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
at least
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal committee
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
we got a list of all the vacancies that
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
are out there
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
and i mean there are hundreds of them
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
and that's all going to lapse
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
and you know at the end of at the end of
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
so i mean it's you know
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a crapshoot you know and uh
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't want to interpret this is
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
as is a gamble i would say that this is
 
01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:22.719 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're considering the
 
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
risks there is some risk to lower
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
revenues than what we're seeing now over
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
the final 16 months of the fiscal year
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
but that based on lapses and and
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
your judgment and experience
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to be ending up putting 100
 
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
million back in that we're pulling out
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
here right is that
 
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
again i'm not trying to put words in
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
your mouth i'm just trying to protect
 
01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:46.550 align:start position:0%
you from the media
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:48.950 align:start position:0%
you from the media
[Laughter]

01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
i think that's a that's a fair statement
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
okay so representative
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
i didn't mean to cut you off
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative walls and then we'll go
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
to was that you represent griffin yeah
 
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
and then representative hatch go ahead
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative walls i just have a
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
question for our esteemed chairman here
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
and that is have you talked to the
 
01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:10.470 align:start position:0%
and that is have you talked to the
treasurer

01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
treasurer
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
about what it's going to mean on the
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
bonds or anything else the state is
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
doing to drop this by 100 and then
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
anticipate putting the other 100 in but
 
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
how the market's going to
 
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
look at it and
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
what how are they going to react what's
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
that going to do to the state
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
um nothing
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
we did
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
i don't remember when it was ken that we
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
had the conversation with the treasurer
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
not about this particular
 
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
dollar figure but about
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
amount of money in the rainy day fund uh
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
made a difference in our
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
bond breeding and so on and
 
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
that that's consistent with the
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
conversations i've had with the treasure
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
one on
 
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
on ways and means the the
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund is a factor that the
 
01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.629 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund is a factor that the
bond

01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
bond
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
experts look at but they're looking more
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
at the aggregate on the overall
 
01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
management and position of the state and
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
so although the rainy day fund is a
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
factor it's not a particularly
 
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
significant one and so when we raised
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
the amount that we were going to put in
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
i was told that it probably would not
 
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
have a positive effect on our bond
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
rating that
 
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:28.790 align:start position:0%
rating that
so

01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
represent griffin on the same subject
 
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like to point out that when they do
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
the bond rating they consider all the
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
liabilities the state may have not just
 
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
the balance sheet liabilities they look
 
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
at the footnotes
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
and they look at the potential suits
 
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
against the state
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
and this takes one of those potential
 
01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:50.550 align:start position:0%
and this takes one of those potential
suits

01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
suits
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
and lowers the impact of it
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that was that you
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative hatcher that had your
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
hand i just
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
i hesitate to mention this but i i'm
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
having a little flashback
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm thinking about 2008 the last
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
time we had to use the rainy day fund
 
01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.669 align:start position:0%
time we had to use the rainy day fund
um

01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
we were in a very similar circumstance
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
talking about our finances a year prior
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
to that a year and a half prior to that
 
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
and then when
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
everything fell out of the bottom
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
the rainy
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
day fund was woefully short
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
of what we needed to operate this state
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
as it was being operated we had to make
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
draconian cuts
 
01:24:31.679 --> 01:24:32.470 align:start position:0%
draconian cuts
and

01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
our salvation then though was in part
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
the tremendous amount of aid we got from
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
the next biennium
 
01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm just concerned and maybe we
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
ought to consider the fact that i'm not
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
sure that same level of aid
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
and rescue
 
01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
will be there for us when the
 
01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
stuff hits the fan this time and and i'm
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
just concerned that it may be sooner
 
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
than later that's um
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm not a defender of the rainy day
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
fund by most means but i am now
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
concerned and i don't think we're in
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
quite a rosy state as we
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
think we may be just based on what has
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
happened previously that's all thank you
 
01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:14.790 align:start position:0%
happened previously that's all thank you
mr

01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
mr
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to ask you a question and then
 
01:25:20.229 --> 01:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
we'll go to represent weiler and um
 
01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:22.639 align:start position:0%
is it your would it be your position
 
01:25:22.639 --> 01:25:23.669 align:start position:0%
is it your would it be your position
that

01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
we should
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
defer funding this until the next fiscal
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
year and we just put it straight out
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
into the budget now i'll ask the same
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
question of representative walner uh not
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
not the least i think
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
based on the revenues that coming that
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
are coming in
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
and what we have now we may very well be
 
01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
able to fund this
 
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
um without a heavy reliance upon the
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
ready to refund that's that's the only
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
thing and and i just learned from neil
 
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
kirk us
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
also and that's the last gap effort the
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund i mean he is standing
 
01:25:59.110 --> 01:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
with that baseball bat i can see his
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
shadow right now but it's just
 
01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
it concerns me that that's all not a
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
criticism or anything else i'm just
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
thinking back to what occurred not too
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
many years ago thank you
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative waller do you
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
want to respond to my question
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
i think the way the bill was drafted in
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
this section from at the beginning was
 
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
the correct way to do it take it from
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
we know now that right now that our
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
revenues are coming in stronger i heard
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
the reason
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
that we want to take it from the rainy
 
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
day fund
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
is because
 
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
let's see if i can come up with how to
 
01:26:35.110 --> 01:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
describe this
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
the reason we want to take it from rainy
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
day fund is that it's like
 
01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's like if i got a raise at work
 
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
and i decided i'm going to spend all
 
01:26:45.669 --> 01:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
that oh boy i'm going to spend all that
 
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm still going to go over here in
 
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
my savings account and i'm going to take
 
01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.430 align:start position:0%
my savings account and i'm going to take
out

01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
enough money to buy myself a new car
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
that's what we're doing so we want to
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
spend all the revenue that's coming in
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
that was the answer i had the first time
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
i asked the question we want to we
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
anticipate all the bills that are coming
 
01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
and we want to spend
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
all of those
 
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
and we want to spend from our savings
 
01:27:12.639 --> 01:27:15.510 align:start position:0%
and we want to spend from our savings
account

01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
i think it's just
 
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
we are the finance committee
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
and we should
 
01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.750 align:start position:0%
and we should
um

01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
think about this and
 
01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
make sure we are
 
01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
clear with what we're doing
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm most concerned that we be clear
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
with the full house
 
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
when we're on the floor that they
 
01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:40.709 align:start position:0%
when we're on the floor that they
understand

01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
that what they're what they're doing
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
i agree with the transparency i i
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
last or two days ago or maybe it was a
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
previous one
 
01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:51.510 align:start position:0%
previous one
i

01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
i i rationalized this without being an
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
expert in the rainy day fund law
 
01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.470 align:start position:0%
expert in the rainy day fund law
that

01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
going back to 1990 and even earlier
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
we were accruing
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
unseen liabilities
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
over all of that course of time so we we
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
we are now recognizing that we've
 
01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.270 align:start position:0%
we are now recognizing that we've
accrued

01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
accrued
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
decades of liability
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
the money that's in the rainy day fund
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
has also accumulated over some number of
 
01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:24.950 align:start position:0%
has also accumulated over some number of
years

01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
and i see some logic on looking at this
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
kind of from an accrual perspective is
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
that we should try to match the accrued
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
revenues with the accrued liabilities
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
does is that argument uh persuasive in
 
01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
you i don't think you have to persuade
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
me you have to persuade the other 400
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
people on the floor
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
on the floor but but your opinion
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
matters more to me than there so i'm i
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
am asking is that at all a persuasive
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
argument for you
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
um no not really
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
big picture numbers
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
biennium budget 13 billion dollars
 
01:29:10.229 --> 01:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
one third of that roughly is going to
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
employee wages and benefits
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's about four billion dollars
 
01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
when we looked in division three
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
at the hhs and we found
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
they were short a thousand employees
 
01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
that allowed us to take 70 million
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
virtually out of that hhs budget
 
01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:30.390 align:start position:0%
virtually out of that hhs budget
which

01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
balanced the budget we were 70 million
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
short of what hhs told us
 
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
if we have
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
3 000
 
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
vacancies which is likely what we're
 
01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:41.990 align:start position:0%
vacancies which is likely what we're
hearing

01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's going to be three times that so
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
if if we were able to get
 
01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:48.950 align:start position:0%
if if we were able to get
um

01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
that much money from vacancies 70
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
million and so it's say it's three times
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
that that's almost two billion
 
01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:56.709 align:start position:0%
that that's almost two billion
so

01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh you know i'm not worried about
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
as as uh the chairman pointed out when
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
we look at all the lapses
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
it's to be big money
 
01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:07.750 align:start position:0%
it's to be big money
and

01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's money that's
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
we put in a budget that will not be
 
01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:12.709 align:start position:0%
we put in a budget that will not be
spent

01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
spent
 
01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
so it's going to lapse there's no other
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
place for it to go
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
and we're still functioning even short
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
of people as we are thank you
 
01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:26.070 align:start position:0%
of people as we are thank you
representation

01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman so
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
i sat next to neil kirk in division one
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
i sat next to neil in the full committee
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
we used to call him mr neil but
 
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
i look at this situation first of all
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
i'm disgusted with what happened whether
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
it be at the sununu center or elsewhere
 
01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:47.669 align:start position:0%
it be at the sununu center or elsewhere
it

01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
and i share the same concerns as my
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
colleagues behind me and in front of me
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
and to the side as far as
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
where the money is coming from
 
01:30:58.149 --> 01:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
but i think if it comes from the rainy
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
day fund in my particular
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
viewpoint that sends a good message
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
because we know the money is there
 
01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.149 align:start position:0%
because we know the money is there
um

01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:08.159 --> 01:31:09.189 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're you know as representative
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
wireless that we heard a week or so ago
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
in fiscal we have perhaps as many as 3
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
000 vacancies in state government but
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
we don't know what can happen in the
 
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
next 15 or 16 months
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
but at least with the rainy day fund
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
right now it stands at about 256 million
 
01:31:27.199 --> 01:31:28.390 align:start position:0%
right now it stands at about 256 million
dollars

01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
and to me knowing that that money is
 
01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
there and would be guaranteed to
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
whatever settlements that may be
 
01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:35.030 align:start position:0%
whatever settlements that may be
forthcoming

01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
forthcoming
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
um those individuals out there know the
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
state's word is there because the money
 
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
is there
 
01:31:43.110 --> 01:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
so i'll support it coming out of the
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
so i don't i don't see a need for a
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
straw vote on this because we we'd
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
already had accepted it but i'll
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
entertain if somebody wants to have a
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
straw vote on this
 
01:31:58.470 --> 01:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
all right all right i
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
i think it was a good conversation i i i
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
learned something i i learned i need to
 
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
do better to persuade you in the future
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
so that's good so
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh uh oh yeah representative walsh
 
01:32:10.159 --> 01:32:11.350 align:start position:0%
uh uh oh yeah representative walsh
please

01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you i just have a comment that i
 
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
find it ironic that the so-called tax
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
and spend democrats are the ones that
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to spend the extra 100
 
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars and the other side of
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
the aisle is when advocating spending
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars it's an unusual role
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
reversal that i just want to bring to
 
01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
people's attention that
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
we seem to be the frugal ones this time
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
i as i understand representative
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
weiler's comments in the past the in and
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
the yang have been backwards and the
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
blue party
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
took from the rainy day fund to fund
 
01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
their budget plans at the outset so it
 
01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
isn't that we're so different it's just
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
our timing is different but
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh representative umber yeah
 
01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
i hope that from that comment uh
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative walls that you don't mean
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
pass this bill
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:33:03.669 --> 01:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
all right thank you because
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
my only reference is whether we raid the
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
so that we can spend the full 250
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
million in surplus or we pull the rate
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
this out of the surplus so we spend less
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
of the surplus and maintain the rainy
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
day fund absolutely we should fund this
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
the question only is
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
where do we take it from i got it okay
 
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
but that that was not how it sounded
 
01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:24.629 align:start position:0%
but that that was not how it sounded
so

01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
oh all right i think we're ready to move
 
01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
on do you remember where we are uh we we
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
took us a side track but uh it was a
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
good one
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
are we on line 25 or lower
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
35 we're on the last change
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
and this is the sunset language
 
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
we uh we asked ols to provide language
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
to repeal the law either on termination
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
of the fund on june 30th
 
01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.070 align:start position:0%
of the fund on june 30th
2032

01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
2032
 
01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:56.950 align:start position:0%
2032
or

01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
when it's determined that
 
01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
the fund is
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
no longer
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
so this repeal language would repeal
 
01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
statute and the change to the right to
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
know law
 
01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
okay so so much of this is the first
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
time we're reading the repeal language
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
so let's take a moment to make sure
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative lynn do you have a
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
comment you know i really just have a
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
question and i'm i'm frankly not sure of
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
the answer but i i raised the question i
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
have no problem
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
with the with the sunset provision with
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
regard to section two
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
i just have a question about
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
is there
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
is there really a reason to repeal
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
section three i i mean i understand that
 
01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
once this
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
once the uh
 
01:35:22.719 --> 01:35:23.830 align:start position:0%
once the uh
uh

01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
this whole claims process is done
 
01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:31.189 align:start position:0%
this whole claims process is done
the

01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
it would be it will be unlikely that the
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
that the uh
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
somebody would make a request to get
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
access to records
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
you know after that time as opposed to
 
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
earlier but maybe
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know i mean what it what if what if
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
in 2035
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
after this is all resolved somebody
 
01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
wants to get access to some
 
01:35:55.830 --> 01:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
records of a settlement
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
or something about a settlement that
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
happened in 2025
 
01:36:01.119 --> 01:36:02.950 align:start position:0%
happened in 2025
would

01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't you want the same
 
01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:06.790 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't you want the same
law

01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
as to as to
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
right to know access
 
01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
to be in existence and so i that that's
 
01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
my only question
 
01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh personally i i agree with that
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
concern completely i
 
01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
just reading it i can't tell
 
01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:23.350 align:start position:0%
just reading it i can't tell
if

01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
if that portion the right to no portion
 
01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:26.470 align:start position:0%
if that portion the right to no portion
is

01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
repealed at the same time is it
 
01:36:29.679 --> 01:36:30.709 align:start position:0%
repealed at the same time is it
um

01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
i think it
 
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
i think it is if i read the language
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
correctly i think it is it says that
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
section two which is the basically the
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
bulk of the bill
 
01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:40.709 align:start position:0%
bulk of the bill
um

01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:40.719 --> 01:36:41.830 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:43.350 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
the rsa 91 a5 13 which is what we've
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
added in section three
 
01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:50.229 align:start position:0%
added in section three
um

01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:50.239 --> 01:36:51.109 align:start position:0%
um
are

01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
shall be repealed so i think it does
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
apply to both
 
01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:55.669 align:start position:0%
apply to both
a

01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:36:55.679 --> 01:36:57.830 align:start position:0%
a
comment

01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:00.470 align:start position:0%
comment
yes

01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:03.109 --> 01:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
this is an experimental program looking
 
01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
at it that way did it
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
work some years later we'll decide did
 
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
it work was it good thing we did
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
if it did then we may want to revitalize
 
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
what we did before and it will still be
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
available but
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we want to
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
take a different approach because there
 
01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
are things in here that are unique and i
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
thought i considered this one of them
 
01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:24.870 align:start position:0%
thought i considered this one of them
so

01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
after we after we can evaluate when this
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
is all said and done if something comes
 
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
up again would we revisit this process
 
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
and it would always be available to put
 
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
the same language back in another bill
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
because it would be whole
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that once we do another process
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
we'll say we should change this we
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
should have changed that going back over
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
it there will be changes so
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
looking at this is an experimental
 
01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
process i'm sure that i can
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
figure out whether we did the right
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
thing or not by repealing that which we
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
created thank you
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
so so representative glenn i'm i'm gonna
 
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna go with your instinct on this
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
and think that maybe
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
the repeal needs to be tweaked so that
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
the right to know
 
01:38:06.159 --> 01:38:07.510 align:start position:0%
the right to know
language

01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
lives beyond for these records uh do you
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
think what's what what's your
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
legislative opinion should we reopen
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
this with ols to tweak the language
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
or should we go ahead and take a vote on
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
this total bill and pass it to full
 
01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:24.149 align:start position:0%
this total bill and pass it to full
finance

01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
finance
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh and while you think of that answer
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll go to
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
mr hayden i think there's a other
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
dimension to this question that really
 
01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
should be considered
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
and you know i i generally agree with
 
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
the statement that you know this fund in
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
this process was expected to be around
 
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
until it was no longer needed
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
the issue is that those words don't
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
actually exist in this bill
 
01:38:49.199 --> 01:38:49.990 align:start position:0%
actually exist in this bill
and

01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know in going back to page three
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
it just says unless early discontinued
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
by the attorney general in consultation
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
with the administrator
 
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
so when you tie that to the repeal of
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
it sort of
 
01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
seems like there's no restrictions on
 
01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's right
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
authority to effectively ask for you
 
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
know the termination of the fund
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh and the repeal of the law
 
01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:19.350 align:start position:0%
uh and the repeal of the law
so

01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think that's what
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
anyone intends but i think that's the
 
01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
way the words could be read
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
so i i think i've been maybe the loudest
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
advocate for a sunset provision on this
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe i'm wrong it would would it
 
01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
just be better to strike all of the
 
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
repeal language knowing we got 10 years
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
to get it right
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
turn mr attorney general yeah i mean the
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
more i've thought about this the more i
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
think it's probably better to let the
 
01:39:50.950 --> 01:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
legislature just repeal this ten years
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
from now or whatever we
 
01:39:54.310 --> 01:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
i mean the legislature's done that
 
01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
before where it will just repeal
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
something once the time comes to repeal
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
it i think that that's another way to to
 
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
handle this and i
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
i've wrestled with whether there are
 
01:40:06.629 --> 01:40:06.639 align:start position:0%
other provisions of the bill that really
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
need to stay in place i think
 
01:40:11.669 --> 01:40:11.679 align:start position:0%
they probably don't but
 
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
the safer course of action
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
given the concern raised with the 91a
 
01:40:18.629 --> 01:40:18.639 align:start position:0%
provision may just be to
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
to take this section out and rely on
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
whoever's in the legislature 10 years
 
01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
from now to repeal it
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
when when the time comes
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
so representative berger are you going
 
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
to remember to repeal this in 10 years
 
01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:35.750 align:start position:0%
to remember to repeal this in 10 years
absolutely

01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
i'll put it on my calendar okay okay
 
01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative lynn i did say i'd come
 
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
back to you for your thoughts on this
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
what do you think
 
01:40:47.189 --> 01:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
you know i i i
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
think i i agree with representative
 
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
umberger and the attorney general that
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
it that seems like a better
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
you know maybe we could
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
the the attorney general is gonna is
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
required to give reports periodically
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
you know maybe at the
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
when the
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know on the last report so to speak
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
he might say and by the way
 
01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:07.109 align:start position:0%
he might say and by the way
you

01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
you folks in the legislature may want to
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
consider repealing this now that it's
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
all over and then and by that point
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
we'll have had
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
all the experience with with the
 
01:41:19.109 --> 01:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
operation of it so that if there are
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
other provisions besides the right to
 
01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
know law that should be kept in effect
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
or something
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh he can make that recommendation to us
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
i don't want to fall on that sword i i
 
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
just like the idea the concept of
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
cleaning up after ourselves if we know
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
this is a temporary project that's going
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
to end i just like
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
having it
 
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
so you know have the garbage take itself
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
out you know but
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
but it seems like the cleanest thing to
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
do at this point would be to repeal it
 
01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
if we're going to open this back up to
 
01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:51.669 align:start position:0%
if we're going to open this back up to
ols

01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
ols
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
i would like to go back to page one and
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
strike the word single that's used on
 
01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.310 align:start position:0%
strike the word single that's used on
line

01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
27 and line 30 and who said that i did
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh representative
 
01:42:06.629 --> 01:42:06.639 align:start position:0%
so before we leave that just so i
 
01:42:06.639 --> 01:42:07.910 align:start position:0%
so before we leave that just so i
understand

01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639 align:start position:0%
back on page 2 line 18 if i read that
 
01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
correctly the fund ends on june 30th
 
01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
2032 is that not correct
 
01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
so why wouldn't we just repeal it on
 
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
june 30th 2032.
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
i i i think what we're noticing is that
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
there may still be
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
public interest in the records and the
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
right to know provisions ought to
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
survive because in particular
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
tweaking 91a a little bit in this bill
 
01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
okay fair enough so leave that if that's
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
important but why not get rid of the the
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
other parts and let the money go back to
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
the stabilization fund
 
01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:54.149 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
this is um not
 
01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:58.310 align:start position:0%
this is um not
uh

01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
has no
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
has no effect on our previous statement
 
01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
that it's going to
 
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
lapse to the
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund in 20
 
01:43:07.679 --> 01:43:08.390 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund in 20
or

01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:12.629 --> 01:43:12.639 align:start position:0%
yeah i understand that's what i'm
 
01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
reading so we still need section two of
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
which is basically the majority of the
 
01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
except for the rsa the uh the uh so just
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused so you on please
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
help me page nine
 
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
line 35 where we start the repeal
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
section the sunset provision
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
are you are you are are you taking issue
 
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
on whether or not we should delete
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
that that paragraph five on repeal the
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
whole paragraph
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
i'm asking about sort of the other half
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
of what you were worried about you you
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
want the rsa 91 a step back and left in
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
there as i understand it and i'm not
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
quibbling that i'm just still wondering
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
why the other part
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
needs to remain
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
section two it does it doesn't
 
01:43:59.590 --> 01:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
we're we're not touching section two
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
no no if i'm not mistaken the repeal
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
repeals sections two and section three
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
am i not reading that correctly that's
 
01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:06.629 align:start position:0%
am i not reading that correctly that's
correct

01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:44:09.189 --> 01:44:09.199 align:start position:0%
we're saying we would repeal those as
 
01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
you want section three i get it
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
but do you want section two
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
why is that not being why would we not
 
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
repeal that is my question to the ag i
 
01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:22.229 align:start position:0%
repeal that is my question to the ag i
guess

01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
guess
 
01:44:22.239 --> 01:44:27.109 align:start position:0%
guess
there

01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
there are a number of provisions
 
01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:29.669 align:start position:0%
there are a number of provisions
in

01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
i think in all of section two that that
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
one might argue should stay in place
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's a provision in there that talks
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
about the fact that the publication of
 
01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:40.550 align:start position:0%
about the fact that the publication of
notice

01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
notice
 
01:44:42.149 --> 01:44:42.159 align:start position:0%
you know is
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
also constitutes um
 
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
notice for purposes of sort of uh
 
01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:49.350 align:start position:0%
notice for purposes of sort of uh
beginning

01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
or cutting off any tolling of the
 
01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations so once that
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
notice is published
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt that the three-year
 
01:44:58.390 --> 01:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
statute of notation starts to run for
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
any claims
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
there's just some other provisions in
 
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:06.310 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
some may feel like should stay around so
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
people can can look back and see in the
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
rsas that this happen that said i also
 
01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:13.910 align:start position:0%
rsas that this happen that said i also
don't

01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
i don't have a huge concern with the
 
01:45:15.679 --> 01:45:16.629 align:start position:0%
i don't have a huge concern with the
bill

01:45:16.629 --> 01:45:16.639 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
with the sunset provision i think my my
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
thought was just
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
it's probably safe or not to sunset it
 
01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
with that i do apologize mr chair i need
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
to leave i have to go back to the office
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
for something
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:45:31.590 --> 01:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
i i think we're really close okay so i
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate everything you've done on
 
01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:34.149 align:start position:0%
appreciate everything you've done on
this

01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%

01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
so thanks yup thank you thank you all
 
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you john sir
 
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative er i i i just i just hate
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry if he's leaving i'll drop it
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
like my last question would have been
 
01:45:49.590 --> 01:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
for him so
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
i know
 
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
okay i i i just want to explain myself
 
01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
and and why i think just deleting
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
paragraph five starting on line 35 and
 
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
running to the next page 10 going
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
through line four just removing that
 
01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
is is just the cleanest way to
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
01:46:11.189 --> 01:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
we don't accidentally break something
 
01:46:13.590 --> 01:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
here i i hate doing legislation on the
 
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
fly in a
 
01:46:18.149 --> 01:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
committee like this so i i am trying to
 
01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
move us towards a vote so we can get
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
this to the finance committee so it's i
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
think we need to have a clean
 
01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
um so so we'll do a straw vote on this
 
01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:34.790 align:start position:0%
um so so we'll do a straw vote on this
um

01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
i i like this amendment a lot and and
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
but i think we've had a conversation
 
01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:43.109 align:start position:0%
but i think we've had a conversation
about

01:46:43.109 --> 01:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:46:43.119 --> 01:46:43.990 align:start position:0%
about
uh

01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:47.669 --> 01:46:47.679 align:start position:0%
starting at page nine line 35 where
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
section five on repeal begins
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
and then ends
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
on page 10 line four
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
i'd like to take a straw poll to see
 
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
who would be in favor of
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
and then the other vote would be who is
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
in favor of keeping it so
 
01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh does everyone understand what what
 
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
the straw vote is going to be
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh raise your hand if you think we
 
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
should delete
 
01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
one two three four
 
01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:27.910 align:start position:0%
one two three four
five

01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh those in favor of retaining the
 
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
so so that was seven four yes okay um
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
did we lose two people or is my mouth
 
01:47:52.629 --> 01:47:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
because the other we had an eight five
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:09.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay leaving it is a
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
not four it'd be five
 
01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:14.870 align:start position:0%
not four it'd be five
okay

01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh all right uh and then uh since that
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
would cause us to open this up with ols
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh i would propose that on line 27 of
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
page one
 
01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
that we change
 
01:48:30.229 --> 01:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
a single
 
01:48:30.239 --> 01:48:31.430 align:start position:0%
a single
to

01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:32.709 align:start position:0%
to
ann

01:48:32.709 --> 01:48:32.719 align:start position:0%
ann
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
so that it reads means and incident
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
and similarly on line 30
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
change the a single to
 
01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:46.229 align:start position:0%
change the a single to
and

01:48:46.229 --> 01:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
so this this is basically just saying an
 
01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:55.270 align:start position:0%
so this this is basically just saying an
incident

01:48:55.270 --> 01:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:59.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
could you ask um
 
01:49:03.910 --> 01:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
folks sitting at the table what their
 
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
take is on changing those words
 
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
taking out single
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am i i think we got their input
 
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
earlier but
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's been a long time so
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:20.159 --> 01:49:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
determining what's an incident is is a
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
big part of the discussion in the
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
resolution of a claim
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
and you know this bill is not going to
 
01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:31.510 align:start position:0%
and you know this bill is not going to
define

01:49:31.510 --> 01:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
define
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
you know that incident it's going to be
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
defined determined in the guidelines um
 
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
you know the use of the word incident
 
01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:40.550 align:start position:0%
you know the use of the word incident
here

01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
is extended to tie to c which is one of
 
01:49:46.629 --> 01:49:46.639 align:start position:0%
more incidents right so it it's i think
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's clear the bill does capture both
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
incidents you know
 
01:49:52.709 --> 01:49:52.719 align:start position:0%
and allowed to be discussed both
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
individually and collectively and that's
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
a long way of saying this change would
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
okay so if you raise your hand on the
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
straw vote you're voting in favor of
 
01:50:10.149 --> 01:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
striking a single and just replacing it
 
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
with the word an a-n
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
so all those in favor of that change
 
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:29.109 --> 01:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any opposed um so
 
01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:33.910 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any opposed um so
um

01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
mr hoffman and mr ripple
 
01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
what i think i want to do is i want to
 
01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
take a
 
01:50:41.669 --> 01:50:41.679 align:start position:0%
a committee vote division one division
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
three that are here
 
01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:44.470 align:start position:0%
three that are here
on

01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
um the umberger amendment
 
01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:49.270 align:start position:0%
um the umberger amendment
with

01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
all of the changes that we've gone
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
through and have accepted
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh in in in into the next well i guess
 
01:50:58.390 --> 01:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
they're already in here right
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
okay so we have to do one more amendment
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
though to strike repeal and strike the
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
word single
 
01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to have a vote
 
01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:10.149 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to have a vote
on

01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
accepting that you guys are going to do
 
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
it right so that we can get out of your
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
way and you can get this ready for the
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
is that is that within protocol
 
01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:24.229 align:start position:0%
is that is that within protocol
okay

01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'd make that motion
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to take a roll call on
 
01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
this right
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
okay so this is uh
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
i i think this is an otpa
 
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
vote um with the umberger amendment uh
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
chain the the two changes that we
 
01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:56.550 align:start position:0%
chain the the two changes that we
specified

01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:58.229 --> 01:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
let's start with uh representative
 
01:51:59.910 --> 01:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
berger she has a question

12-1 okay
 
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
that makes sense all right uh
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
so with that i i think we've completed
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
our work here we'll no we haven't what's
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
what's our more work we have to
 
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
come up with who's going to do the
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
blurbs or what thank you i will do
 
01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:55.750 align:start position:0%
blurbs or what thank you i will do
the

01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:53:58.870 --> 01:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
blurb for the positive side and i just
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
wondered if there is
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
going to be a uh
 
01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:06.629 align:start position:0%
going to be a uh
a

01:54:06.629 --> 01:54:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
a minority um i
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
could possibly vote yes in full
 
01:54:12.159 --> 01:54:13.270 align:start position:0%
could possibly vote yes in full
committee

01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:54:15.189 --> 01:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
i've got some things i need to think
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
about that i'm concerned with this but
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
if they're if i do vote no i will write
 
01:54:21.589 --> 01:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
a report for it i'm not
 
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill at large they're
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
just a few sections that i'm concerned
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
with so um
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
it'll be kind of a positive negative
 
01:54:30.159 --> 01:54:31.030 align:start position:0%
it'll be kind of a positive negative
verb

01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
verb
 
01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:31.910 align:start position:0%
verb
okay

01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
so representative rogers
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
trying to be precise i i think your vote
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
is recorded as an as a no and then you
 
01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
can't change that unless we reopen the
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
vote no i'm not going to change it here
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
i said in full committee oh in full
 
01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
committee okay all right very good and
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
then you'll write the blurb if you
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
keep your position i got it thank you
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
okay now i think we're done
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to refer this to the full
 
01:55:02.229 --> 01:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
finance committee on tuesday okay
 
01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
so with that uh thank you uh i
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
it feels like a pretty good bill to me
 
01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh but we don't know until we've done it
 
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
