good morning everyone apologies for the
 
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
slight delay in getting our meeting
 
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
started here this morning but
 
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
as you may have seen there's a lot of
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
paper flying around we have a lot of
 
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
amendments to bills that we're going to
 
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.390 align:start position:0%
amendments to bills that we're going to
be

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
exacting here this morning
 
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 align:start position:0%
and as you probably also noticed there's
 
00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 align:start position:0%
a lot of activity Happening Here on the
 
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
State House complex this morning with
 
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
bills being heard in other committees
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
and rallies being staged to support or
 
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
oppose those bills and other committees
 
00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
so it's a it's a busy morning
 
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
but let's start our day the way we
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
customarily do by standing and joining
 
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas as he leads
 
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.010 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
okay so our job here this morning is to
 
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
pass judgment on 12 bills we received
 
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
from the Senate we've had public
 
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
hearings on all 12 bills
 
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
and we have amendments to propose on
 
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
several of these bills
 
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.390 align:start position:0%
several of these bills
now

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 align:start position:0%
the bills have been listed in numerical
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
order but we may not take them up in
 
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
that order because
 
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
there are additional amendments that
 
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
still may be in the pipeline
 
00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
so we may have to take things up out of
 
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.770 align:start position:0%
so we may have to take things up out of
order

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
in order to allow the pipeline to
 
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
and to prove my point there we're going
 
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
to take up
 
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 225 first
 
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to open an exact session on
 
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 225
 
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
and I recognize
 
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:25.860 align:start position:0%
representative Troy murner for a motion

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 225. chair recognizes
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative naughter
 
00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
I second the motion chair recognizes
 
00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:38.150 align:start position:0%
I second the motion chair recognizes
representative

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman uh I
 
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:44.780 align:start position:0%
propose amendment uh
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
2023-1397h which corrects A Minor error
 
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
in at the beginning of the bill
 
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:55.580 align:start position:0%
so it's been moved and seconded that we
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
resolve to judge House Bill 225 as
 
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
worthy of ought to pass subject to an
 
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.290 align:start position:0%
worthy of ought to pass subject to an
amendment

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
and so the question now is on the
 
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:08.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
2023-1397h which essentially just
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
corrects a mistake made by OLS
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
and we know that os does a fantastic job
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
in very seldom makes mistakes but
 
00:08:24.409 --> 00:08:24.419 align:start position:0%
they are human and we all make mistakes
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
right so is there any discussion on this
 
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:34.310 align:start position:0%
right so is there any discussion on this
amendment

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk if he's
 
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.889 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk if he's
ready

00:08:38.889 --> 00:08:38.899 align:start position:0%
ready
 
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
we're about to call the roll
 
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
on the amendment
 
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.690 align:start position:0%
on the amendment
to

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:50.700 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
this is we are doing government work so
 
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
it does require a form as you all are
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay so the clerk is now ready to call
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
the roll on amendment
 
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:33.420 align:start position:0%

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
the question of ought to pass as amended
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
see uh Wendy Thomas representative
 
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
Thomas yes thank you um
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
I was thinking about this bill last
 
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
night um because apparently I don't have
 
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
a life
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
um and remember the question I asked
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
about the date it's the committee ending
 
00:10:57.769 --> 00:10:57.779 align:start position:0%
on November 1st and the report being due
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
on November 1st the reason that that was
 
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
a an issue for me and I'm not trying to
 
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
be a pain in the butt even though my dad
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
says that's my middle name but if you
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
issue the report and you've got
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
questions on this complex report who do
 
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
you ask your questions of if the
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
committee has been dissolved
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
good question I think that even if the
 
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
committee is dissolved the members of
 
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
the committee who have signed the report
 
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
would be available to answer answer
 
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.310 align:start position:0%
would be available to answer answer
questions

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
no different than any other report that
 
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
we well I mean it's not enough for me to
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
vote against this but it's just I mean
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
your explanation yesterday was that this
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
is the way it's always done perhaps we
 
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
should re-look at the way it's always
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
been done
 
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just okay good suggestion by the way
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
we can't really move on without a motion
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
and a second so I'm going to recognize
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative merner to make a motion
 
00:11:59.769 --> 00:11:59.779 align:start position:0%
I make a motion that we ought to pass
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 225 as amended
 
00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:05.339 align:start position:0%
representative notter a second the
 
00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
motion so it's moved and seconded now
 
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
that we resolve to judge this bill otpa
 
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
now further discussion
 
00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:16.019 align:start position:0%
I'm done I said okay representative uh
 
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
representative murder
 
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
yes I was a part of the
 
00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:22.019 align:start position:0%
commission and the reason first of all
 
00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:23.459 align:start position:0%
we had a commission set of a committee
 
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
the bill was in the second year of the
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
session so we we went with the
 
00:12:29.329 --> 00:12:29.339 align:start position:0%
commission and we thought we could get
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
this thing done by last November and as
 
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
you see in the report we had a ton of
 
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
material we met quite oftenly over at
 
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
dra all summer and into the fall and we
 
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
knew that we we got a lot of things I
 
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
end up but we still have a little bit
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
more to go as uh was in test of
 
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
testifying yesterday so uh it's going to
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
be the same play as all back at the
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
table and we're going to try to get this
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
thing I complete can I uh your
 
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
recognized representative Wendy Thomas
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
um I completely understand that I mean
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
which is why you know I'm going to vote
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
for this bill to go forward
 
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
however we've all recognized that this
 
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
is going to be a very complex report
 
00:13:06.769 --> 00:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm assuming it will generate
 
00:13:06.779 --> 00:13:10.490 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm assuming it will generate
questions

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
this is a very complex thing when it
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
came to the tax and and I don't think
 
00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
there's only a couple of members here
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
when we back we did 700 and in the month
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
of October we kept track back when we
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
had a retained bill on this which we
 
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
deleted this section of that and I think
 
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
Mike can testified as we had 13 hours of
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
work on a work study that fall just
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
trying to iron out things in this we
 
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
still didn't get anywhere in them when
 
00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:34.820 align:start position:0%
we had to put a committee together and
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
through Ways and Means and they ended up
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
getting this bill done and it took
 
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
another I forget like close to a year to
 
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
get it all ironed out so this is the
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
last piece of what we're trying to get
 
00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:46.569 align:start position:0%
last piece of what we're trying to get
done

00:13:46.569 --> 00:13:46.579 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:49.139 align:start position:0%
okay yeah no I appreciate it I think
 
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the clerk now to call the role
 
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
on the question of ought to pass as
 
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%

1408 H so let me explain this amendment
 
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
basically what this amendment does is it
 
00:16:11.689 --> 00:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
adds a Sunset date to the
 
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220 align:start position:0%

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
and at the
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
suggestion of
 
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams we made this a
 
00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.069 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams we made this a

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
Sunset period
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
the repeal takes effect on July 1st of
 
00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:37.139 align:start position:0%

response to comments made during the
 
00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
public hearing that
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
this bill could potentially set a
 
00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
precedent for redefining customer
 
00:21:33.649 --> 00:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
generator to be
 
00:21:36.049 --> 00:21:36.059 align:start position:0%
something different than what it already
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
has been defined in statute as being
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
so the language on lines 17 through 21
 
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
was added to the
 
00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.230 align:start position:0%
was added to the
Amendment

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
to specify that a hydroelectric
 
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
generator that is not the utility
 
00:21:59.930 --> 00:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
customer account of record at the point
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
of interconnection to the electric grid
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
was at one time owned by the current
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
electric utility customer or a prior
 
00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.330 align:start position:0%
electric utility customer or a prior
electric

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:10.340 align:start position:0%
electric
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
utility customer at the point of
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
interconnection to the electric grid and
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
that such an electro hydroelectric
 
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
generator that is not the electric
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
utility customer account of record
 
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
submits its initial proposed process and
 
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
methodology described below to the
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
basically what this amendment does is it
 
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.330 align:start position:0%
basically what this amendment does is it
restricts

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
restricts
 
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
this entire bill
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
to two
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
companies Monadnock paper
 
00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
and Brookfield Hydro
 
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
and the reason that we decided that this
 
00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
was worthy of doing even though it kind
 
00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
of focuses on two individual com
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
companies rather than a broad policy for
 
00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
that applies to everybody is because
 
00:22:59.810 --> 00:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
both of these companies
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
when their Hydro facilities were
 
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
interconnected to the grid they were
 
00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
wired in a non what we would consider
 
00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
today to be a non-standard manner
 
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
and it's too expensive to undo what was
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
done when they were initially wired so
 
00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
what this bill does it is it essentially
 
00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:24.299 align:start position:0%
grants an exception to those two
 
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
companies it would be very similar to a
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
zoning Board of adjustment granting a
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
variance or an exception to a zoning
 
00:23:31.799 --> 00:23:32.810 align:start position:0%
variance or an exception to a zoning
ordinance

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh that is a good analogy for what this
 
00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
bill does from an ad knock paper and
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
Brookfield Hydro
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
so that's what the amendment does are is
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
there any need for discussion
 
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas
 
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
um just curious do you know who did the
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
wiring was it um a utility or was it a
 
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
private company that did it
 
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
well it was an Internet interconnection
 
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
to the grid so I anticipate that the
 
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
utility did it
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
but I don't know that for certain I'm
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
not sure anybody knows that does anybody
 
00:24:09.289 --> 00:24:09.299 align:start position:0%
in the audience have any direct
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the answer to that question
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
I didn't think so uh if you really want
 
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
to know we could research that but thank
 
00:24:21.289 --> 00:24:21.299 align:start position:0%
you I'm just curious
 
00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further discussion on the
 
00:24:24.179 --> 00:24:30.890 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further discussion on the
amendment

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059 align:start position:0%
seeing none I guess we can proceed to a
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
vote so I'll ask the clerk to call the
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
roll on the question of adoption of the
 
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
hang on what did I do out of order
 
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.710 align:start position:0%
hang on what did I do out of order
foreign

motions in seconds

we already did them okay we're good all
 
00:24:55.799 --> 00:24:58.430 align:start position:0%
we already did them okay we're good all

shall we put this on the consent
 
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
calendar or is it too complex a bill for
 
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.470 align:start position:0%
calendar or is it too complex a bill for
that

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.350 align:start position:0%
 
concerns

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I think the
 
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
fact that it is so complex and it took
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
us this long to work it out there's
 
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
nobody in this room that wants to try to
 
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
explain this on the floor of the house
 
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
good point good point okay on consent it
 
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.470 align:start position:0%
good point good point okay on consent it
goes

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
goes
 
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
happily so I like the way this is going
 
00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
so far this morning
 
00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:07.100 align:start position:0%
all right uh so
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas will write the
 
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:13.740 align:start position:0%
committee report for Senate bill 40. and
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
with that we'll close the exact session
 
00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 40. Mr chair
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas
 
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
um when you say representative Thomas
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
could you just please identify which
 
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
sorry that's okay representative we know
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
that representative Doug Thomas made the
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
motion so I know but if people are
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
listening that's the only thing I never
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
call her one you are what the taller one
 
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
I'm the taller one
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
all right so the taller representative
 
00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:45.299 align:start position:0%
Thomas will write the committee report
 
00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:48.179 align:start position:0%
for Senate bill 40.
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
since we're on a roll here let's move on
 
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
to Senate bill 113. I will open a
 
00:28:59.049 --> 00:28:59.059 align:start position:0%
a executive session on Senate Bill 113

00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:57.419 align:start position:0%
all right sorry I didn't say that
 
00:29:59.210 --> 00:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
clearly clearly enough so that you could
 
00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.529 align:start position:0%
clearly clearly enough so that you could
hear

00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:00.539 align:start position:0%
hear
 
00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
all right it's been moved and seconded
 
00:30:05.769 --> 00:30:05.779 align:start position:0%
that we adopt a motion number
 
00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
1399h and since I propose that motion I
 
00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
will explain it the amendment so what
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment does is you'll recall
 
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
when we passed HB 549 last year
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
we put two guard rails in place
 
00:30:21.889 --> 00:30:21.899 align:start position:0%
to check the growth of the system
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
benefits charge the first one was the 65
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
percent uh
 
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.350 align:start position:0%
percent uh
electricity

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency improvements
 
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price Index
 
00:30:45.769 --> 00:30:45.779 align:start position:0%
inflation Adder for the system benefits
 
00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299 align:start position:0%
charge and to that we added a 0.25
 
00:30:48.299 --> 00:30:49.490 align:start position:0%
charge and to that we added a 0.25
percent

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.789 align:start position:0%
percent
sweetener

00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.289 --> 00:30:56.299 align:start position:0%
well since Senate Bill 113
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
restricts the 65 percent limit to yearly
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
or annually instead of Lifetime
 
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
we felt it would be prudent to tighten
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
up the other guard rail by removing the
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
0.25 percent Adder so that's what this
 
00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
bill does or this amendment does if you
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
look at line 19
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
it strikes the language plus 0.25
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
percent all as calculated and
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
adds the language as determined and
 
00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
verified by the department of
 
00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:32.700 align:start position:0%
and of course the rest of that sentence
 
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
is by the department of energy so that's
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
all the bill does is it deletes that
 
00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
adder and uh
 
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
this allows us to pass a bill that gives
 
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
both sides something that they feel is
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate and so I urge you to support
 
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
this amendment and I would like to hear
 
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:00.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative McGee yeah I just would
 
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
like to reiterate what I said in
 
00:32:06.649 --> 00:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
yesterday's hearing I I
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
just want to make it clear that the
 
00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the language as being
 
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
lifetime isn't something that we you
 
00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
know lost anything on because it was
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
really a misreading of what was intended
 
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
by the 65 percent rule which had never
 
00:32:24.649 --> 00:32:24.659 align:start position:0%
been extrapolated to include lifetime
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
before so I don't feel like it's a quid
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
pro quo but I do think that the adder is
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
not significant enough for us to
 
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
the roll on the question of adoption of
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%

as amended by Amendment 1399 h
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
will be reported out as ought to pass as
 
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
amended and without objection we'll put
 
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
seeing no objection on the consent
 
00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:26.900 align:start position:0%
calendar it goes I will write the
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
committee report for Senate bill
 
00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.630 align:start position:0%
committee report for Senate bill
113.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
113.
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll close the exact
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
and since we are on a roll here
 
00:35:46.609 --> 00:35:46.619 align:start position:0%
a representative not her there's an FN
 
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
on the bill so can it go on I don't
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
think it can go on consent calendar okay
 
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
why why can't it
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
FN says that it's indeterminate
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
that the department can't calculate what
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
the cost can be then it can go on the
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
consent calendar for all practical
 
00:36:10.609 --> 00:36:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.619 --> 00:36:12.589 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:36:17.569 --> 00:36:17.579 align:start position:0%
let's keep this train moving and move on
 
00:36:17.579 --> 00:36:18.770 align:start position:0%
let's keep this train moving and move on
to

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:18.780 align:start position:0%

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
and on this bill I'd like to recognize
 
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:33.060 align:start position:0%

1346 H now we discussed this amendment
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday at our work session
 
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
this amendment was requested by the
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
makes a couple of small changes on rule
 
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:31.020 align:start position:0%

yeah I'll second that
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
moved and seconded that we judge
 
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 161 to be worthy of ought to
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
pass as amended by
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
1346h further discussion
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll make this quick because I made
 
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
this point yesterday I think uh having
 
00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
subsidized solar for someone making 80
 
00:39:50.569 --> 00:39:50.579 align:start position:0%
of the area meaning income it's just way
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
too high uh someone could be making less
 
00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
than that living in an apartment where
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's not even possible to put up solar
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
or maybe a mobile home or a small house
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
where they don't have the land for it
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be subsidizing the
 
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
electric bill of someone who could very
 
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
possibly be making more money than they
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
can so I can't vote for this bill
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
yeah we had a lot of discussion about
 
00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
carve outs under the net metering
 
00:40:20.569 --> 00:40:20.579 align:start position:0%
provisions and this is another one but I
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
think it's our responsibility to do
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
everything we can especially for
 
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
low-income people who are suffering uh
 
00:40:27.069 --> 00:40:27.079 align:start position:0%
High rates and so
 
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
this is the least we can do is a little
 
00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:32.579 align:start position:0%
bit at a time and everything helps
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
and so we owe it to our constituents to
 
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
get this passed
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative muns thank you Mr chair I
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
I would just point out that um 80
 
00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
percent of the average Mark our average
 
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
median income in the state in most areas
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's about it's between 52 and 55 000
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
The Only Exception is the Seacoast and
 
00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
Nashua where it's uh in the sixty
 
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar range so I don't think
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about people that are
 
00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:05.780 align:start position:0%
making exorbitant amounts of money
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative McGee
 
00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
I think that the last thing I draw our
 
00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
attention to is that this is actually
 
00:41:15.609 --> 00:41:15.619 align:start position:0%
follow through on SB 270 for low-income
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh solar from last session and so it's
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
sort of the follow-on Bill of how to
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
implement that for the doe and this
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
portion you know specifically calls out
 
00:41:29.329 --> 00:41:29.339 align:start position:0%
public housing authorities
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
um or how or housing project that's as
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
described in so I think we are uh we do
 
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
have guard rails around this in terms of
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
what populace is being served and it's
 
00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.390 align:start position:0%
what populace is being served and it's
just

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
um you know it's just giving the rest of
 
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
the language around it what percentage
 
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
of the people in that group uh would
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
fall into the income categories that
 
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
would allow them to qualify so I I don't
 
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
see any problem with the language in
 
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
terms of anybody getting an undue
 
00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:59.569 align:start position:0%
terms of anybody getting an undue
advantage

00:41:59.569 --> 00:41:59.579 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lewicki
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask clerk to call the

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:02.700 align:start position:0%

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.050 align:start position:0%
 
18-2

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
18-2
 
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
so by a vote of 18 to two the committee
 
00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:23.339 align:start position:0%
will pour it out we'll report out
 
00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 161 as ought to pass as
 
00:43:26.579 --> 00:43:28.670 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 161 as ought to pass as
amended

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
and uh it will not go on the consent
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
calendar I suspect it'll go on the
 
00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
regular calendar
 
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
and representative merner will write the
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee report will there be a
 
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
Minority Report
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington will write a
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
minority let me finish please
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
um I don't think there's any point in
 
00:43:50.089 --> 00:43:50.099 align:start position:0%
not putting this on the consent calendar
 
00:43:50.099 --> 00:43:51.470 align:start position:0%
not putting this on the consent calendar
so

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
all right so representative uh
 
00:43:59.210 --> 00:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
Harrington thinks we ought to put this
 
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
on consent calendar any objection to
 
00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:02.390 align:start position:0%
on consent calendar any objection to
that

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
the other one would be Lex
 
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
okay I guess it does go on the consent
 
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
so that's five in a row on the consent
 
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
all right so we will close the exact
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:28.980 align:start position:0%
I think our path is probably going to
 
00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:31.140 align:start position:0%
get a little rockier from this point
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
forward but we'll continue on as we've
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
had a pretty good run so far
 
00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.650 align:start position:0%
had a pretty good run so far
so

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
let's move next to
 
00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:47.460 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 166 relative to grid
 
00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:54.349 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 166 relative to grid
modernization

00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen the amendment come
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
my Amendment or your Amendment Mr
 
00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:08.750 align:start position:0%

it was well we're all looking for our
 
00:46:02.329 --> 00:46:02.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
I just found my copy of 1391 which is
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
for 167.
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
while we're discussing that uh please
 
00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
representative McGee oh here it is 1392.
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
when you and I we didn't make a motion
 
00:46:23.569 --> 00:46:23.579 align:start position:0%
yet so yes when you and I spoke over the
 
00:46:23.579 --> 00:46:24.890 align:start position:0%
yet so yes when you and I spoke over the
weekend

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
weekend
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
um there was a pending amendment that
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
you had put in with some minor
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
um minor changes correct and I took your
 
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
changes and I um reviewed the language
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
that had been submitted to us around how
 
00:46:39.359 --> 00:46:40.130 align:start position:0%
that had been submitted to us around how
um

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
how pricing would be considered
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
um and so I added language that I
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
thought would make things more clear
 
00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
um on basically how how credits would be
 
00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
extended on exports to the distribution
 
00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
grid to reduce retail load so I read
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
that right uh to the committee yesterday
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
and that was what you said you supported
 
00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
correct yeah so I found it and so I'm
 
00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
going to make a motion for Senate Bill
 
00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.630 align:start position:0%
going to make a motion for Senate Bill
166

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
166
 
00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and I'll recognize
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative McGee for
 
00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:14.700 align:start position:0%

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
okay so this amendment was distributed
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
to members of the committee yesterday
 
00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:41.030 align:start position:0%

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:44.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
2023-1392h I second the motion by
 
00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
representative McGee to adopt this
 
00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:51.250 align:start position:0%
representative McGee to adopt this
amendment

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:51.260 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:54.020 align:start position:0%
you said
 
00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
so what this amendment does to
 
00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
repeat what some of what representative
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
McGee just said is it strikes the word a
 
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.650 align:start position:0%
McGee just said is it strikes the word a
pilot

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
pilot
 
00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
on line five and
 
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
inserts one to five Pilots
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
in in replacement of that stricken
 
00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.609 align:start position:0%
in in replacement of that stricken
phrase

00:48:25.609 --> 00:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
phrase
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
it then changes the word may to shall
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
on line eight
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
and it adds a new sentence on lines 9
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
through 12.
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
that says that the Public Utilities
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
Commission May approve utility
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
participation in a pilot for transactive
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
energy and distributed energy resources
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
and the associated Advanced metering
 
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.430 align:start position:0%
and the associated Advanced metering
infrastructure

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
as components of grid modernization if
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
the jurisdictional conflicts under
 
00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
paragraph 3 are successfully resolved
 
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
and then further down
 
00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
it aligns
 
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.329 --> 00:49:11.339 align:start position:0%
language that was there previously and
 
00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
replaces it with explanatory language
 
00:49:18.849 --> 00:49:18.859 align:start position:0%
that says that that describes how credit
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
for transmission
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
shall be allocated transmission costs
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
shall be allocated to the distribution
 
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
utility Network customer
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
and this is all language that Chris Bilo
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
Clifton Beeler rather discussed with us
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing and I spoke
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
with Chris Cliff offline about it I
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
understand it thoroughly and I agree
 
00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
that this is decent language to add to
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have any discussion on
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:56.089 --> 00:49:56.099 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
with all the confusion of finding this
 
00:49:59.690 --> 00:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
amendment did we actually complete our
 
00:50:02.329 --> 00:50:02.339 align:start position:0%
motion to adopt OTP
 
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
yes I I moved OTP McGee seconded it okay
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
and then McGee moved the amendment and I
 
00:50:11.329 --> 00:50:11.339 align:start position:0%
seconded that
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
just a quick comment this is a good idea
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
but don't underestimate how much time
 
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
and work it's going to take don't expect
 
00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
something to come back out of the puc in
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
six months on this trying to find out
 
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
the exact credit for transmission on
 
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
distribution just with generation it's
 
00:50:29.089 --> 00:50:29.099 align:start position:0%
going to be a very technical and
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
time-consuming effort so just like I say
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea but don't hold your
 
00:50:33.119 --> 00:50:35.329 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea but don't hold your
breath

00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:35.339 align:start position:0%
breath
 
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
I believe the POC has a docket open on
 
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
this question already so
 
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
the investigation has already started
 
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:49.740 align:start position:0%

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:15.020 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:18.740 align:start position:0%
166 as amended by
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
1392 h
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
is adopted by the committee
 
00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.430 align:start position:0%
is adopted by the committee
and

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
without objection we'll put it on the
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
seeing no objections or hearing none
 
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
this bill will go on consent along with
 
00:53:37.609 --> 00:53:37.619 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
five we've already put there
 
00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
and I will ask representative McGee if
 
00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
she'd be willing to write the committee
 
00:53:47.809 --> 00:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
report on this bill happy too
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
sorry did you say yes I said happy too
 
00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
all right so with that we'll close the
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.089 --> 00:54:08.099 align:start position:0%
so since we're right here why don't we
 
00:54:11.569 --> 00:54:11.579 align:start position:0%
continue with Senate bill 167.
 
00:54:14.569 --> 00:54:14.579 align:start position:0%
so I'll open a public hearing on Senate
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
bill 167.
 
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
and recognize representative Thomas
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:26.220 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Doug Thomas
 
00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:28.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman on
 
00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
sb167 I motion the itl
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
Fair recognizes representative Bernardi
 
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's moved and seconded that we itl
 
00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:43.140 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 167 relative to Green
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
hydrogen and energy and infrastructure
 
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes representative
 
00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:49.849 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes representative
Thomas

00:54:49.849 --> 00:54:49.859 align:start position:0%
Thomas
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
um we have no objection whatsoever to uh
 
00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
green hydrogen but the bill contains
 
00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
Provisions in there that speak of a tax
 
00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
or subsidy to rate payers and that is
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
one area that we we don't agree on but
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
the hydrogen is a good idea we like the
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
idea but the taxes part of it is
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
something that we just agree with
 
00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Kaplan
 
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
yeah we heard in uh testimony from
 
00:55:22.609 --> 00:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters uh when he came to
 
00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
present on this bill that in order to
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
really attract
 
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
the the federal money that's available
 
00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
for green hydrogen we need to show that
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
we have some skin in the game so to
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
speak and that is why those tax credits
 
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:36.770 align:start position:0%
speak and that is why those tax credits
exist

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
so I think if we're serious
 
00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
about becoming part of a
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
clean energy system in the region and
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
not being the whole of the donut when it
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
comes to receiving this money and we've
 
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
seen that there's a lot of movement
 
00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
around green hydrogen and creating a hub
 
00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
we need to step up our game so to speak
 
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
and and so that's it's a it's a pretty
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
well-known fact that you know uh
 
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
State participants need to show that
 
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
they are taking this seriously and so
 
00:56:07.609 --> 00:56:07.619 align:start position:0%
that's why this credit these credits
 
00:56:07.619 --> 00:56:10.430 align:start position:0%
that's why this credit these credits
exist

00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion on this
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki thank you Mr
 
00:56:15.359 --> 00:56:16.609 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki thank you Mr
chairman

00:56:16.609 --> 00:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
um at this time we are talking about
 
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
something that's purely hypothetical in
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there is no hydrogen there
 
00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
is no one to use it
 
00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
and whether we should become the venture
 
00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
capitalist of Last Resort in my mind the
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
answer is no this is if there are people
 
00:56:36.829 --> 00:56:36.839 align:start position:0%
in industry or wherever who want to
 
00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:39.300 align:start position:0%
start a hydrogen economy then let's see
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
them do this uh initiate it rather than
 
00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:44.089 align:start position:0%
them do this uh initiate it rather than
us

00:56:44.089 --> 00:56:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
I would make the observation that when
 
00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
government tries to help or regulate
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
technology it's always too little too
 
00:56:52.319 --> 00:56:54.470 align:start position:0%
technology it's always too little too
late

00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
late
 
00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
and this bill I think is a classic
 
00:56:57.890 --> 00:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
example of that
 
00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
it's trying to
 
00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
pave the way for something that is very
 
00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
little well not well understood at this
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
point in time and if it's just a Chase
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
for money that's not the purpose of the
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
we passed judgment on
 
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
policy that relates to
 
00:57:23.809 --> 00:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
science and technology and energy not on
 
00:57:23.819 --> 00:57:25.750 align:start position:0%
science and technology and energy not on
chasing

00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
chasing
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
subsidies chasing federal grants
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
establishing taxpayer subsidies none of
 
00:57:35.089 --> 00:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
that is part of what we should be doing
 
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
here so I can't support this bill for
 
00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
that reason
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a comment
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up to that we do
 
00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
have a department of energy now and one
 
00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
of the functions is to go after Federal
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
money for projects that with this we
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
don't need specific legislation to do it
 
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
we have a department that's well
 
00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:56.220 align:start position:0%
equipped to take care of that
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
just like you chair I
 
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
um would possibly take a point in that
 
00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
our job is also to deliver uh cost
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
savings to the people of New Hampshire
 
00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
and so our job to some degree is chasing
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
dollars however in this particular case
 
00:58:17.809 --> 00:58:17.819 align:start position:0%
I will vote with the itl legislation
 
00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
over environmental concerns about
 
00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
interaction of hydrogen not being a
 
00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas and of itself
 
00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
but it does tend to affect free radicals
 
00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:29.579 align:start position:0%
in our upper atmosphere and it tends to
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh what you should be doing their job
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
of basically uh working on the methane
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
and since uh 2020 was a record year for
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
methane I'm very concerned about pumping
 
00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
anything in creating do any further
 
00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
damage to our atmosphere
 
00:58:50.809 --> 00:58:50.819 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Kaplan
 
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair um
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
as far as the the free radical question
 
00:58:58.849 --> 00:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
uh it's you know from from what I've
 
00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
read that would only really become a
 
00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:03.140 align:start position:0%
problem if hydrogen
 
00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:04.870 align:start position:0%
problem if hydrogen
became

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
became
 
00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
much larger part of our generation mix
 
00:59:10.849 --> 00:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
and and our Energy System in general so
 
00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
what this is talking about is what green
 
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
hydrogen is intended to do is provide
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
the last mile so to speak of
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
decarbonization and very hard to reach
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
Industries such as cement and steel
 
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
making Transportation where uh the
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
current elect Electric System really
 
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
even with a much larger scale of
 
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:31.140 align:start position:0%
renewable input would not really be able
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
to take
 
00:59:35.809 --> 00:59:35.819 align:start position:0%
to take effect so green hydrogen is seen
 
00:59:38.089 --> 00:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
as an essential part of our move to
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
decarbonize and become a net zero
 
00:59:39.839 --> 00:59:40.990 align:start position:0%
decarbonize and become a net zero
economy

00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
economy
 
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:43.799 align:start position:0%
and it's a shame that New Hampshire
 
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:46.980 align:start position:0%
continues to drag its heels in that
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
transition and I think it's as
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
represented partial sites to the
 
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
detriment of our constituents and the
 
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:55.140 align:start position:0%
cost savings that could benefit
 
00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:58.130 align:start position:0%
cost savings that could benefit
everybody

00:59:58.130 --> 00:59:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
representative murder has a comment yes
 
01:00:03.289 --> 01:00:03.299 align:start position:0%
it was in the papers we have a big
 
01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:05.220 align:start position:0%
hydrogen plant under construction now up
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
in the north country and I brought him
 
01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
here five years ago was a running koa's
 
01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
Economic Development Corporation and the
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
reason they picked out of state they
 
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
were from Utah
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
is because we have we're business
 
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
friendly here and they search the area
 
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
to find a site so I disagree with you
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
comments respectively Mr Kaplan but uh
 
01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
we already have advantages here and they
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
will come here thank you representative
 
01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.430 align:start position:0%
will come here thank you representative
McGee

01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
McGee
 
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
um I I actually view the bill a little
 
01:00:37.849 --> 01:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
bit differently I think you know what I
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
heard from Senator Waters in introducing
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
it was that this is an enabling bill
 
01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
that is looking at potential future
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that we don't want to be
 
01:00:53.089 --> 01:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
ignoring so it kind of sets up in
 
01:00:53.099 --> 01:00:54.250 align:start position:0%
ignoring so it kind of sets up in
statute

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:54.260 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
consideration for how we would approach
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
it if we were to welcome this type of
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
industry and to really anticipate that
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's coming I think when we say we're
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
that's not our job I mean if it's not
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
our job who's we're saying the
 
01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
department of energy they can't
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily go after the money unless
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
we've already passed laws in the state
 
01:01:18.289 --> 01:01:18.299 align:start position:0%
that show the federal government that we
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
actually are you know preparing
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
ourselves so I look at it as an
 
01:01:26.809 --> 01:01:26.819 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill and I am agnostic in
 
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
terms of I'm not an expert on hydrogen
 
01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
or green hydrogen or gray hydrogen and I
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
only know what I've read but I do know
 
01:01:34.799 --> 01:01:35.930 align:start position:0%
only know what I've read but I do know
that

01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
um that the fuel mix is changing in the
 
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
region and I don't want to see New
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire be behind the eight ball on
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so I'll be voting on to
 
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.910 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so I'll be voting on to
pass

01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative munz thank you Mr chair I
 
01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
would just Echo the comments of
 
01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
Representative McGee that you know this
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
isn't enabling piece of legislation
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
we're not mandating anything
 
01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
um the legislature for years has
 
01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
utilized a few fiscal levers that it has
 
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
such as the business and profits tax to
 
01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.349 align:start position:0%
such as the business and profits tax to
encourage

01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
policies that the legislature believes
 
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
is in the best interest of the State of
 
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I would also add that
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
this is another this is a um this would
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
be a you know a jobs Bill a a a way to
 
01:02:27.119 --> 01:02:28.750 align:start position:0%
be a you know a jobs Bill a a a way to
create

01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
create
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
good paying jobs
 
01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
that could attract people to New
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to help us
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
address some of the demographic
 
01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
challenges that we have and the
 
01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:45.980 align:start position:0%
resulting fiscal challenges so I will be
 
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
also voting ought to pass representative
 
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:50.750 align:start position:0%
also voting ought to pass representative
Summers

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
Summers
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh when I look at
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
this I think of exactly what we've had
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
before with the electric car debate we
 
01:02:59.809 --> 01:02:59.819 align:start position:0%
talked about in here in actually an
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
executive committee discussion here how
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
well electric cars yes they use lithium
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
they have to mine lit strip mine lithium
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
and they have to mine Cobalt or nickel
 
01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
or whatever material it is for the
 
01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
battery that's bad for the environment
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
but the electric car is good for the
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
environment because it's not putting out
 
01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
CO2 when the car is running
 
01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
same way of you hydrogen be a very would
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
be positive in my opinion for the for
 
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
the for the environment and folks have
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
found blue gray and green and blue and
 
01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
gray comes from natural gas which 10
 
01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
years ago in this committee natural gas
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
was supposedly clean and it exists and
 
01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
so it would be no different than lithium
 
01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:46.220 align:start position:0%
bad Cobalt bad electric cars are good
 
01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
blue green gray hydrogen
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
all good
 
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
01:03:55.849 --> 01:03:55.859 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas thank you Mr
 
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to make a statement
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
that um regarding the government's role
 
01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
I personally feel that we make too many
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
laws quite frankly but I I believe that
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
um uh unless there's a obstacle or
 
01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:14.900 align:start position:0%
Reason Why say the department of energy
 
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
could not go after a government grant
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
for for hydrogen I I say you know let
 
01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
the executive branch follow their
 
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
10-year strategy and if they come across
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
an obstacle then they can come to us and
 
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
say we need to fix something but until
 
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
then this is almost like a you know a
 
01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
solution to looking for a problem so I
 
01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:39.059 align:start position:0%
think we're on the right course here at
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
itl is
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative Christian has a comment
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um just wanted to uh I
 
01:04:50.089 --> 01:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
guess agree with my colleagues Mickey
 
01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
and muns about our role of enabling
 
01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure I also know that on this
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
committee what's come up a few times as
 
01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
concerns about much carbon neutral
 
01:05:02.809 --> 01:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
technology not being dispatchable I
 
01:05:06.049 --> 01:05:06.059 align:start position:0%
think that hydrogen can fill that hole
 
01:05:08.329 --> 01:05:08.339 align:start position:0%
and as such we have a responsibility to
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
try to enable it thank you
 
01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:14.339 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a comment
 
01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yeah I'd like to
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank my colleague representative
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
Christian for that point and uh
 
01:05:25.849 --> 01:05:25.859 align:start position:0%
you know just say that when it comes to
 
01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
you know all this technology and the uh
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
what the future brings you know we don't
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
have to all be experts here on it in
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
order to have the state of New Hampshire
 
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
make a small move recognize that this
 
01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
energy technology uh is an important one
 
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
that's being taken up uh around the
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
country and again New Hampshire
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the donut hole the state
 
01:05:50.589 --> 01:05:50.599 align:start position:0%
that does nothing in the whole Northeast
 
01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:53.700 align:start position:0%
uh to send out a signal that we're
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
welcoming uh this technology or
 
01:05:58.130 --> 01:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
companies that might be interested in
 
01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
this technology to the state so I'm
 
01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
going to be voting uh against itl
 
01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan you've made two
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
comments already do you have anything
 
01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
new to add
 
01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
I was just going to use your analogy of
 
01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
the coupons
 
01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and say that uh resistance to
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
the state offering a minimal amount of
 
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
tax credits is like saying you don't
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
want to go buy the newspaper so you cut
 
01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
out the coupon when you're going to shop
 
01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
for your groceries I mean that's it's
 
01:06:34.609 --> 01:06:34.619 align:start position:0%
that Pennywise pound foolish
 
01:06:34.619 --> 01:06:37.490 align:start position:0%
that Pennywise pound foolish
foreign

01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you additional comments or
 
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
questions or anything
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none I think uh we're at the
 
01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
point where we can ask the clerk to call
 
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
the roll on the question of Ito on
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
Senate bill
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
it's an amendment
 
01:06:54.289 --> 01:06:54.299 align:start position:0%
we don't have an amendment on the floor
 
01:06:58.130 --> 01:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
the question on the floor is itl

my list and I will show you in one
 
01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.930 align:start position:0%
my list and I will show you in one
second

01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:22.940 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
representative Tony will write the
 
01:08:26.289 --> 01:08:26.299 align:start position:0%
committee it'll be Tony Kaplan
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan will write the
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
today is Tuesday I would ask at all the
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
majority and minority reports be
 
01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
submitted to me by close of business on
 
01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:56.090 align:start position:0%
submitted to me by close of business on
Thursday

01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
all right so I'm going to close the
 
01:08:58.970 --> 01:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
public hearing I mean the executive
 
01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
session now on Senate bill 167.
 
01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.289 align:start position:0%
session now on Senate bill 167.
[Music]

01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:03.299 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
and let's see if we can do one or two
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
all right I guess I'm being lobbied for
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
a break right now so let's take a 10
 
01:09:20.329 --> 01:09:20.339 align:start position:0%
minute break and return return here at
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
10 20 for for further action on our
 
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
on our list of bills to exec today so
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
okay so resuming executive session on
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
five to go
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
so we've done seven one
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
we've done seven we have five to go
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
so with that being the case let's open
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
up an executive session on Senate Bill
 
01:23:10.189 --> 01:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
52 relative to the regulation and
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
operation of electrical or electric
 
01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
vehicle charging stations and the chair
 
01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Harrington he
 
01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
said I would move to itl Senate bill 52.
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Summers
 
01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
I second the motion
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's moved and seconded that we itl
 
01:23:31.970 --> 01:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 52 chair recognizes
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
um well first of all it is uh I have a
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
lot of issues with the bill because it's
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
not it opened up the possibility of
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
people other than those who use the
 
01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
vehicle charging stations paying for
 
01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:48.410 align:start position:0%
vehicle charging stations paying for
them

01:23:48.410 --> 01:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
um and I just don't think that should be
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
the case if people want to pay for them
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
especially if we're looking at
 
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
out-of-state people coming up uh and
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
they say it's a I think the quote was a
 
01:23:59.630 --> 01:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
desert or something a charging desert in
 
01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire well they should be able
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
to uh have a charge such that that's
 
01:24:06.890 --> 01:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
done because it's to me it's important
 
01:24:08.570 --> 01:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
that the people who use the should pay
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
for it if you don't have an electric
 
01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
vehicle you're not getting any advantage
 
01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
out of having an electrical vehicle
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
charging stations and I don't want to
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
see that cost be pushed around to the
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
rate payers which is where we seem to
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
head on all these things it'll be no
 
01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
different than if we said okay everybody
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
that has an electric vehicle doesn't buy
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
gas so we're going to charge them so
 
01:24:30.410 --> 01:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
much money to keep gas stations running
 
01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
um I just don't think it's a good idea I
 
01:24:34.729 --> 01:24:34.739 align:start position:0%
think that these uh things could will
 
01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
come on their own without us subsidizing
 
01:24:38.689 --> 01:24:38.699 align:start position:0%
it through the rate payers
 
01:24:41.689 --> 01:24:41.699 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Corman
 
01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would note that
 
01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
the bill does not mandate any uh any
 
01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
charges anywhere just says potential
 
01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
sources of funding may include but are
 
01:24:53.450 --> 01:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
not limited to and then lists various
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
things some of which are specific to EV
 
01:24:58.370 --> 01:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
owners EV registration surcharges
 
01:25:00.410 --> 01:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
surcharges on electricity purchased
 
01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
through public EV charging stations for
 
01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:04.550 align:start position:0%
through public EV charging stations for
example

01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:05.810 align:start position:0%
example
um

01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
and in terms of the bill itself and the
 
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill
 
01:25:12.110 --> 01:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to see more electric
 
01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
vehicles coming into the state
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
both from residents of the state who own
 
01:25:21.410 --> 01:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
EVs and need to charge them and perhaps
 
01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
don't have the wherewithal to do that
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
where they live
 
01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
either that they're in apartments that
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't provide those facilities or they
 
01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
just can't afford to put a charger in at
 
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
their home
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
but even more importantly we're going to
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
see people coming from out of state for
 
01:25:37.199 --> 01:25:38.870 align:start position:0%
see people coming from out of state for
tourism

01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
tourism
 
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
if we do not have sufficient charging
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in the state what's going
 
01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:45.300 align:start position:0%
to happen is that people from
 
01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Connecticut Rhode Island
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
New York
 
01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:49.729 align:start position:0%
New York
Jersey

01:25:49.729 --> 01:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
Jersey
 
01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
are not going to come here because they
 
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
feel like they won't be able to charge
 
01:25:56.450 --> 01:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
up and get home our tourism industry
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
will feel it we will start seeing a
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
decline in our meals and rooms taxes as
 
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
a result as well to say nothing of the
 
01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
jobs that the tourism industry supports
 
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
so I think that this bill is actually
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
quite essential for the economic future
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
of the state given how much we rely on
 
01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.689 align:start position:0%
of the state given how much we rely on
tourism

01:26:17.689 --> 01:26:17.699 align:start position:0%
tourism
 
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a comment
 
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
um I don't totally disagree with my good
 
01:26:29.689 --> 01:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
colleague however I have good faith in
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
our free market system and our private
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
industry and if we got to a point where
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
they saw that their business might be
 
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
slacking off particularly during the
 
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
summer time I believe they will do what
 
01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
free market does they will invest on
 
01:26:49.129 --> 01:26:49.139 align:start position:0%
their own and provide what services they
 
01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
believe will keep people coming to their
 
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
to their you know position so I think
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
that over time people will do what is
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
necessary to keep their their business
 
01:27:00.719 --> 01:27:01.689 align:start position:0%
necessary to keep their their business
going

01:27:01.689 --> 01:27:01.699 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
maybe not to the extent that you feel
 
01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
that that we would do it but I just
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
think the free market will respond when
 
01:27:11.770 --> 01:27:11.780 align:start position:0%
when needed
 
01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:15.780 align:start position:0%
I would add to that that last summer we
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
saw a huge spike in the price of natural
 
01:27:20.590 --> 01:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
gas due to some
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
unpredictable and unexpected
 
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
geopolitical events
 
01:27:29.149 --> 01:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
and also due to some policies by the
 
01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:30.780 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
that put the brakes on oil and natural
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
gas exploration and exploitation
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
so when the price of natural gas spiked
 
01:27:44.209 --> 01:27:44.219 align:start position:0%
the price of electricity followed it and
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
spiked as well
 
01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:47.639 align:start position:0%
here we are
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
eight nine ten months later and the
 
01:27:52.129 --> 01:27:52.139 align:start position:0%
natural price of natural gas has fallen
 
01:27:52.139 --> 01:27:53.390 align:start position:0%
natural price of natural gas has fallen
dramatically

01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
why did that happen
 
01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:56.390 align:start position:0%
why did that happen
because

01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
the free market in natural gas
 
01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
prompted producers to produce more of it
 
01:28:06.169 --> 01:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
to satisfy the demand that was out there
 
01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
for natural gas that's why the price
 
01:28:10.490 --> 01:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
fell that's why the prices of our
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
electricity are going to fall in the
 
01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:13.330 align:start position:0%
electricity are going to fall in the
next

01:28:13.330 --> 01:28:13.340 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
RFP process and it's proof positive that
 
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
the free market works and I agree with
 
01:28:23.209 --> 01:28:23.219 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas that in this Doug
 
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
Thomas and that in this particular case
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh the free market if there's a demand
 
01:28:30.649 --> 01:28:30.659 align:start position:0%
out there for electric charging stations
 
01:28:32.689 --> 01:28:32.699 align:start position:0%
they'll get built no question in my mind
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
about that representative murder
 
01:28:37.129 --> 01:28:37.139 align:start position:0%
is thank you Mr chairman
 
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:39.300 align:start position:0%
um in testimony the head of the
 
01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
Automobile Dealers Association gave a
 
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
plug to my town
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
um we have a a Ford dealer Garage in
 
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
this in Lancaster and he solely is
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
invested a major amount of money into a
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
charging station into the town
 
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
um because there's like you guys just
 
01:28:56.450 --> 01:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
stated that if there's any it's the free
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
market there's a demand for something
 
01:28:59.570 --> 01:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
they will build it you know if there's
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
money in it they're going to build it we
 
01:29:02.930 --> 01:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
don't have to uh subsidize these things
 
01:29:05.209 --> 01:29:05.219 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
representative Christian has a comment
 
01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
um to this point I don't disagree that
 
01:29:14.689 --> 01:29:14.699 align:start position:0%
business owners will likely
 
01:29:17.209 --> 01:29:17.219 align:start position:0%
um begin to incorporate this if they see
 
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
a demand however this seems to me to be
 
01:29:21.169 --> 01:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
an unnecessary burden on our local
 
01:29:23.330 --> 01:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
business owners for something that is
 
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and and seems to me like
 
01:29:27.550 --> 01:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
something that that we should be doing
 
01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
you know as we provide Interstate as we
 
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
provide transmission lines things like
 
01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:33.590 align:start position:0%
provide transmission lines things like
that

01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
um the sort of infrastructure seems like
 
01:29:37.490 --> 01:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
something we should handle not something
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
that every corner store needs to to do
 
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:45.709 --> 01:29:45.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Wendy Thomas
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
has a comment
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
um thank you um this bill simply sets up
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
a committee there's no mandates there's
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
nothing that is going to take away from
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
anybody or anything it's a committee to
 
01:29:58.129 --> 01:29:58.139 align:start position:0%
look at all aspects of Eva charging
 
01:30:00.649 --> 01:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
stations and just like the hydrogen Bill
 
01:30:03.290 --> 01:30:03.300 align:start position:0%
we just discussed I see this as an
 
01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
enabling and a jobs bill for New
 
01:30:05.159 --> 01:30:08.209 align:start position:0%
enabling and a jobs bill for New
Hampshire

01:30:08.209 --> 01:30:08.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
further comment further discussion
 
01:30:14.090 --> 01:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
on the motion to itl representative
 
01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
Harrington I would just use one example
 
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
I guess to show how things work if you
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
came to New Hampshire in the summertime
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
40 or 50 years ago almost no place had
 
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
air conditioning but people started to
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
think well we need air conditioning we
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
want to have air conditioning people put
 
01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
in air conditioning everywhere if you
 
01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
went to some place 80 years ago 90 years
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
ago there probably weren't that many gas
 
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
stations people started showing up with
 
01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
cars they built more gas stations we
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
didn't require a government program to
 
01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
get people to air condition their hotels
 
01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
people did it because they responded to
 
01:30:46.850 --> 01:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
the demands of the public they'll do the
 
01:30:48.770 --> 01:30:48.780 align:start position:0%
same on this the government doesn't have
 
01:30:51.290 --> 01:30:51.300 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:30:55.370 --> 01:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
representative muns
 
01:30:57.950 --> 01:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
I I would also add to that picture of
 
01:31:00.290 --> 01:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire 40 50 60 years
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
ago the fact that if you tried to do
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
that you were most likely going on very
 
01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
small two-lane roads and then the
 
01:31:09.890 --> 01:31:09.900 align:start position:0%
government decided that it was ever in
 
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
everybody's best interest to build the
 
01:31:12.890 --> 01:31:12.900 align:start position:0%
interstate highway system
 
01:31:15.649 --> 01:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
and that it was a tremendous Boon for
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's economy
 
01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
and the private Market would not have
 
01:31:22.990 --> 01:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:26.450 --> 01:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a comment
 
01:31:28.490 --> 01:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
just to comment on interstate highway
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
system that was built as a defense
 
01:31:33.649 --> 01:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
mechanism that was Eisenhower
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
Administration saying we need to have
 
01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
roads where we can move the Army from
 
01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
one point in the country to another
 
01:31:41.159 --> 01:31:44.030 align:start position:0%
one point in the country to another
quickly

01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.370 --> 01:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a comment
 
01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I just want to add on to
 
01:31:52.689 --> 01:31:52.699 align:start position:0%
the representative's comment that um
 
01:31:55.850 --> 01:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
roads infrastructure that's built into
 
01:31:58.010 --> 01:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
the Constitution as a responsibility of
 
01:31:59.689 --> 01:31:59.699 align:start position:0%
the federal government you know
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
providing charging stations is not so
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's a distinction there
 
01:32:07.010 --> 01:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question a
 
01:32:10.490 --> 01:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
comment thank you Mr chairman uh and I
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
understand the point about having the
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
private sector provide much of the
 
01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:16.669 align:start position:0%
private sector provide much of the
equipment

01:32:16.669 --> 01:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
01:32:18.770 --> 01:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
but there's also all the front of the
 
01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:19.970 align:start position:0%
but there's also all the front of the
meter

01:32:19.970 --> 01:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
meter
 
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
equipment and infrastructure that needs
 
01:32:24.530 --> 01:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
to be supplied and that really is not
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the private sector
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
so this is enabling legislation to see
 
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:37.250 --> 01:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
so you don't think the utilities which
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
are private companies are part of the
 
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
not entirely I mean they're quite
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
regulated and you know I they're
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
regulated in fact by
 
01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
the government and I think the
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
government needs to be looking into this
 
01:32:57.410 --> 01:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:00.290 --> 01:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
specifies that we want as a people to
 
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
have limited government right
 
01:33:03.890 --> 01:33:03.900 align:start position:0%
representative lewiki you had a quest
 
01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:06.770 align:start position:0%
representative lewiki you had a quest
comment

01:33:06.770 --> 01:33:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:08.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:33:12.110 --> 01:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a comment
 
01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I think everyone
 
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:15.890 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I think everyone
is

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:15.900 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
making some valid points but again I
 
01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
think a lot of the this discussion and
 
01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:22.139 align:start position:0%
the objections and concerns about this
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
bill again we should always be talking
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
about the bill and what the bill does
 
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
and the bill is not
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
to establish a state program of
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
deploying EV charging stations it's to
 
01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
form a committee to look at some of the
 
01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:36.950 align:start position:0%
form a committee to look at some of the
issues

01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
and get further into them and
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
probably do a service like
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
Define what would be the
 
01:33:49.850 --> 01:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
proper limited role what might be the
 
01:33:51.649 --> 01:33:51.659 align:start position:0%
proper limited role of the state
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
government and responsibilities of the
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
state government versus the private
 
01:33:58.250 --> 01:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
sector or municipal government so this
 
01:34:00.050 --> 01:34:00.060 align:start position:0%
bill is to establish a committee to
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
start to
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
think about this issue and help us all
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
understand it more I don't understand
 
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
why we keep declining to declining
 
01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
efforts like on the green hydrogen Bill
 
01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:12.709 align:start position:0%
efforts like on the green hydrogen Bill
too

01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
learn more and and have a body that
 
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
would come back and inform us so that we
 
01:34:20.570 --> 01:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
might make better legislation in the
 
01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:22.010 align:start position:0%
might make better legislation in the
future

01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
01:34:27.770 --> 01:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I would uh Echo that uh
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
for the most part this is a study uh uh
 
01:34:35.689 --> 01:34:35.699 align:start position:0%
committee it is not uh an uh it is not
 
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
legislation and it's to study the issue
 
01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm listening to during the
 
01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
testimony uh there's questions about
 
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:44.360 align:start position:0%
what does it mean by universal access
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
there were some suggestions that perhaps
 
01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
this might be a good Avenue to look at
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
things like road taxes I think there's
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
many issues to resolve here and I don't
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
think that just putting our head in the
 
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
sand saying we don't think that we think
 
01:34:58.850 --> 01:34:58.860 align:start position:0%
that electric cars are passing fed or
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
something is going to get us where we
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
need to be as a state we're going to
 
01:35:04.729 --> 01:35:04.739 align:start position:0%
lose out so I would refer something a
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
motion to retain rather than something
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you the purpose of the committee
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
is to recommend legislation and in this
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
case it would be to grow government
 
01:35:18.649 --> 01:35:18.659 align:start position:0%
which is against limited government
 
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
which is what we believe and we already
 
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
have over 150 commissions and committees
 
01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
we have to pay mileage which is costing
 
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers money and we have paid
 
01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
researchers let them do their job we
 
01:35:36.729 --> 01:35:36.739 align:start position:0%
don't need another committee
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:45.770 --> 01:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
to amplify representative knotters point
 
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
I think this legislature
 
01:35:49.729 --> 01:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
I've been in the legislature now for
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
nine years I think this legislature has
 
01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
grown somewhat lazy over the years and
 
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
rather than put in the hard work to
 
01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:58.490 align:start position:0%
rather than put in the hard work to
research

01:35:58.490 --> 01:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
research
 
01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
how to develop effective legislation
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
there's been a tendency especially in
 
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
the last four or five years to fall back
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
issue of creating a study committee to
 
01:36:13.129 --> 01:36:13.139 align:start position:0%
do that hard work
 
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
so instead of
 
01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
each of us taking the responsibility to
 
01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
do the hard work
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
and do the research necessary to come up
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
with good solid legislation we want to
 
01:36:29.689 --> 01:36:29.699 align:start position:0%
deflect that work onto the backs of our
 
01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
colleagues who get appointed to a study
 
01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:34.250 align:start position:0%
colleagues who get appointed to a study
committee

01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
study committees very often don't come
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
up with much useful information study
 
01:36:42.649 --> 01:36:42.659 align:start position:0%
committee reports very often end up in
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
the circular file
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
and I think we need to at some point say
 
01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:48.470 align:start position:0%
and I think we need to at some point say
no

01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
let's break the cycle of deflecting hard
 
01:36:54.649 --> 01:36:54.659 align:start position:0%
questions onto the backs of study
 
01:36:54.659 --> 01:36:55.610 align:start position:0%
questions onto the backs of study
committees

01:36:55.610 --> 01:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:36:58.129 --> 01:36:58.139 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
01:36:58.139 --> 01:36:58.970 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
chair

01:36:58.970 --> 01:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
um this study committee acknowledges
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
that this is a new field that has new
 
01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
experts and therefore we don't have the
 
01:37:10.010 --> 01:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
answers and and this bill does exactly
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
what we're supposed to do set up a
 
01:37:13.850 --> 01:37:13.860 align:start position:0%
committee to look at a new field with
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
new experts
 
01:37:21.050 --> 01:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
seeing that I'll ask the clerk to call
 
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
the roll on the question of itl for
 
01:37:34.250 --> 01:37:34.260 align:start position:0%

10 the motion of itl fails
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%

representative McGee I'd like to make a
 
01:38:33.169 --> 01:38:33.179 align:start position:0%
motion OTP
 
01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative McGee moves OTP is there
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
a second
 
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative Munns seconds the motion
 
01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
of OTP on Center Bell 52.
 
01:38:46.970 --> 01:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
representative muns
 
01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd like to introduce
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
01:38:57.550 --> 01:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:01.610 --> 01:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
is there a second my second
 
01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
representative muns moves Amendment 1401
 
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
H seconded by representative McGee
 
01:39:09.290 --> 01:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
discussion on this amendment
 
01:39:12.649 --> 01:39:12.659 align:start position:0%
representative Munds thank you Mr chair
 
01:39:14.570 --> 01:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
um this this amendment is relatively
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
straightforward uh what it does is uh it
 
01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
removes section four on page three of
 
01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
the bill as uh amended by the Senate
 
01:39:27.890 --> 01:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
which deals with
 
01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:28.430 align:start position:0%
which deals with
um

01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:30.530 --> 01:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
which which provides some direction to
 
01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission during
 
01:39:37.129 --> 01:39:37.139 align:start position:0%
the testimony we um we heard uh
 
01:39:39.610 --> 01:39:39.620 align:start position:0%
testimony and we discussed the fact that
 
01:39:42.970 --> 01:39:42.980 align:start position:0%
it would be premature to have the puc
 
01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
taking any specific actions until the
 
01:39:48.050 --> 01:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
study committee had completed its work
 
01:39:49.610 --> 01:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
and there seemed to be a general
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
consensus that if this bill were to move
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
forward that it would be in
 
01:39:58.490 --> 01:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
um the best interest to remove that that
 
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
requirement so that's all that this
 
01:40:03.229 --> 01:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
amendment does
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
quick question so the amendment just
 
01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.070 align:start position:0%
quick question so the amendment just
removes

01:40:07.070 --> 01:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
removes
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
starting on line 22 and going through to
 
01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:11.750 align:start position:0%
starting on line 22 and going through to
line

01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
five on page two just removes text from
 
01:40:16.129 --> 01:40:16.139 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
yes that's it
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
a question representative Harrington
 
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:29.159 align:start position:0%
yeah just a question so just don't get
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
this clear what you're saying is that
 
01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
the existing bill would have the Public
 
01:40:35.330 --> 01:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission start an
 
01:40:39.169 --> 01:40:39.179 align:start position:0%
investigation or a process before the
 
01:40:39.179 --> 01:40:40.209 align:start position:0%
investigation or a process before the
commission

01:40:40.209 --> 01:40:40.219 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:42.719 align:start position:0%
released its report
 
01:40:44.810 --> 01:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
yeah that's how I read the bill it it
 
01:40:48.169 --> 01:40:48.179 align:start position:0%
basically said that the commission shall
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
within two years consider a number of
 
01:40:53.570 --> 01:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
things and the implication is that that
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
would start immediately and that just
 
01:40:57.229 --> 01:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
seemed premature given the fact that the
 
01:40:58.490 --> 01:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
study committee hadn't even done its
 
01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
work yet okay that makes sense thank you
 
01:41:02.570 --> 01:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that during Pub the public
 
01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
hearing it was explained to us that that
 
01:41:07.370 --> 01:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
was old language that the reference to
 
01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
two years was
 
01:41:11.810 --> 01:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
a reference to two years following the
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
initial adoption of that statute and
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
that two-year period had already expired
 
01:41:20.689 --> 01:41:20.699 align:start position:0%
and therefore the
 
01:41:23.629 --> 01:41:23.639 align:start position:0%
language that you want to delete is
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
actually obsolete language it has
 
01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the performance of
 
01:41:29.209 --> 01:41:29.219 align:start position:0%
the bill as it existed isn't that
 
01:41:29.219 --> 01:41:30.729 align:start position:0%
the bill as it existed isn't that
correct

01:41:30.729 --> 01:41:30.739 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
I didn't I don't recall that but that
 
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
would make sense and would just be
 
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
another reason to delete the language
 
01:41:44.810 --> 01:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.729 --> 01:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
seeing that I guess we'll ask the clerk
 
01:41:48.890 --> 01:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
to call the role on the adoption of
 
01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:51.550 align:start position:0%
to call the role on the adoption of
amendment

01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:51.560 align:start position:0%

14-6 by a vote of 14-6 the amendment
 
01:43:07.010 --> 01:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
1401 H is adopted
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
the chair now will entertain a motion of
 
01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:12.950 align:start position:0%
the chair now will entertain a motion of
otpa

01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
otpa
 
01:43:20.090 --> 01:43:20.100 align:start position:0%

um adopt uh adopt the bill with
amendment

01:43:27.229 --> 01:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative McGee
 
01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative McGee seconds the motion
 
01:43:38.990 --> 01:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
of otpa
 
01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
Is there further discussion on the bill
 
01:43:48.530 --> 01:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:51.530 --> 01:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative McGee I think the only
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
thing I would add is we've already
 
01:43:55.129 --> 01:43:55.139 align:start position:0%
discussed the fact that it's a study and
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
people have feelings about adding
 
01:43:58.430 --> 01:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
studies and whether we should be doing
 
01:44:00.530 --> 01:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
the work versus a study
 
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
um I think everyone on the committee
 
01:44:04.129 --> 01:44:04.139 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to do all of the work and I
 
01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
think it makes sense on something that
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
we have so many questions about and so
 
01:44:09.649 --> 01:44:09.659 align:start position:0%
many differing opinions that we actually
 
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
do allow a study to go forward so we can
 
01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
have some of those answers that's that's
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none I'll ask clerk to call
 
01:44:29.450 --> 01:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
the role on the question of otpa on
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 52.
 
01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:35.580 align:start position:0%

Thomas Corman yes
 
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
Ned Reynolds yes jeremose no 10 10.
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
by a vote of 10 they ought to pass as
 
01:45:30.530 --> 01:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.229 --> 01:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
the next motion that the chair would
 
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
entertain his emotion to retain
 
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
I personally have no appetite for that
 
01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
but if the committee does have an
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
appetite for retain I would entertain
 
01:45:47.169 --> 01:45:47.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.370 --> 01:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a motion to retain
 
01:45:52.189 --> 01:45:52.199 align:start position:0%
representative McGee moves to retain
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 52
 
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:59.510 align:start position:0%
is there a second
representative

01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative partial seconds the
 
01:46:04.370 --> 01:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
motion to retain
 
01:46:06.290 --> 01:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
I'll start the discussion by pointing
 
01:46:08.810 --> 01:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
out that we've already retained 13 bills
 
01:46:11.649 --> 01:46:11.659 align:start position:0%
in this committee this year
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
and that presents a fairly substantial
 
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
workload for us either in the month of
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
June if I can convince the speaker to
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
let us begin to begin early
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
or in starting in the month of September
 
01:46:31.970 --> 01:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so I would just urge you all to
 
01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind as you try to decide
 
01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
whether this bill is worth retaining Mr
 
01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
Senator McGee yeah I just wanted to say
 
01:46:40.970 --> 01:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
I I I'll withdraw my motion to retain
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
because I think it's fairly unusual to
 
01:46:44.689 --> 01:46:44.699 align:start position:0%
retain a study committee bill either
 
01:46:47.090 --> 01:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
we're going to say there will be a study
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
committee or they won't so will this go
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
to the floor without recommendation then
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
yes it will okay
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
okay so representative McGee withdraws
 
01:46:58.609 --> 01:46:58.619 align:start position:0%
her motion to retain the bill therefore
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
the bill will go to the floor without
 
01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:02.689 align:start position:0%
the bill will go to the floor without
recommendation

01:47:02.689 --> 01:47:02.699 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:47:04.729 --> 01:47:04.739 align:start position:0%
the motion on the floor will be ought to
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
pass as amended by
 
01:47:11.149 --> 01:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1401 h
 
01:47:14.330 --> 01:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
that will be the first motion
 
01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:15.770 align:start position:0%
that will be the first motion
so

01:47:15.770 --> 01:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:20.590 --> 01:47:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:23.209 --> 01:47:23.219 align:start position:0%
from representative Corman
 
01:47:26.930 --> 01:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
Gorman will write the motion for
 
01:47:30.910 --> 01:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:33.530 --> 01:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
and representative Harrington will write
 
01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:34.430 align:start position:0%
and representative Harrington will write
the

01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:40.010 --> 01:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:43.609 --> 01:47:43.619 align:start position:0%
okay once again I'll remind members to
 
01:47:43.619 --> 01:47:45.050 align:start position:0%
okay once again I'll remind members to
um

01:47:45.050 --> 01:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:47.390 --> 01:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
submit your committee reports to me by
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
close of business on Thursday
 
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll close the public
 
01:47:56.090 --> 01:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
hearing on I mean the executive session
 
01:48:00.530 --> 01:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:04.850 --> 01:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
now we can open a executive session on
 
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
so representative McGee and I have been
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
discussing what to do about Senate bill
 
01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:15.830 align:start position:0%
discussing what to do about Senate bill
54.

01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
54.
 
01:48:19.010 --> 01:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
and we would like to propose jointly
 
01:48:22.129 --> 01:48:22.139 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:48:24.830 --> 01:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
form a subcommittee
 
01:48:27.890 --> 01:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
to study the issues that were raised in
 
01:48:32.209 --> 01:48:32.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
and make a recommendation to the full
 
01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:36.109 align:start position:0%
and make a recommendation to the full
committee

01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:48:39.290 --> 01:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
we would recess the
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
exec committee on this bill today
 
01:48:45.649 --> 01:48:45.659 align:start position:0%
and notice it on a future date
 
01:48:49.370 --> 01:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
probably the first of May
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
if we did form such a subcommittee
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee would likely meet next
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
Monday April 24th
 
01:49:01.370 --> 01:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
so I would like to hear discussion from
 
01:49:04.370 --> 01:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
the members about whether you think a
 
01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is desirable or if you want
 
01:49:08.330 --> 01:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
to proceed
 
01:49:11.209 --> 01:49:11.219 align:start position:0%
with making a passing judgment on this
 
01:49:13.550 --> 01:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
bill today
 
01:49:17.090 --> 01:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair
 
01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:19.430 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair
um

01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
do you want me to make the motion for
 
01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee
 
01:49:26.030 --> 01:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
no I won't speak to I don't think we
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
need a motion to do that I think what we
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
need is a discussion of whether it's
 
01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
worthwhile yes
 
01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:33.719 align:start position:0%
um I think what happened in the hearing
 
01:49:35.149 --> 01:49:35.159 align:start position:0%
is that we had
 
01:49:35.159 --> 01:49:36.169 align:start position:0%
is that we had
um

01:49:36.169 --> 01:49:36.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:38.830 --> 01:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
we had testimony from varying
 
01:49:41.330 --> 01:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in and around our committee
 
01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
that were in opposition to each other
 
01:49:46.629 --> 01:49:46.639 align:start position:0%
where decisions need to be made and
 
01:49:48.649 --> 01:49:48.659 align:start position:0%
greater discussion I think and
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
understanding needs to be obtained by
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
this committee before we can say that
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
we're comfortable putting through a bill
 
01:49:56.689 --> 01:49:56.699 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a sea change in terms of
 
01:49:59.149 --> 01:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
policy so some of those open questions
 
01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:02.159 align:start position:0%
require additional Examination for us to
 
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
be sure that what we're passing is going
 
01:50:07.970 --> 01:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
to actually have the effects that we uh
 
01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:10.679 align:start position:0%
you know kind of we agree that we would
 
01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
like to see prices come down we're not
 
01:50:15.649 --> 01:50:15.659 align:start position:0%
convinced that that will be the effect
 
01:50:17.930 --> 01:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
of the bill before us and so I think we
 
01:50:19.250 --> 01:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
just want to do a little more due
 
01:50:21.530 --> 01:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
diligence before we let the bill pass
 
01:50:23.629 --> 01:50:23.639 align:start position:0%
through the committee
 
01:50:25.609 --> 01:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the question of
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
whether we should form a subcommittee to
 
01:50:29.930 --> 01:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
look further into this bill
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm going off of
 
01:50:37.609 --> 01:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
what I said yesterday that I'm in favor
 
01:50:40.129 --> 01:50:40.139 align:start position:0%
of helping the ratepayer any way we can
 
01:50:42.830 --> 01:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
and there was the couple lines where I
 
01:50:44.209 --> 01:50:44.219 align:start position:0%
said it would have to be stricken before
 
01:50:46.490 --> 01:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
I'd ever go for it and that was line 18
 
01:50:48.890 --> 01:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
and 19. so if there was any work to be
 
01:50:52.129 --> 01:50:52.139 align:start position:0%
done to where the rate payers did were
 
01:50:53.330 --> 01:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
not responsible for the difference
 
01:50:55.490 --> 01:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
between the agreement payments and
 
01:50:57.890 --> 01:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
proceeds through uniform annual factors
 
01:50:59.689 --> 01:50:59.699 align:start position:0%
and rates then I think could be
 
01:50:59.699 --> 01:51:03.290 align:start position:0%
and rates then I think could be
worthwhile

01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan
 
01:51:08.450 --> 01:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it's very worthwhile I
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
think we're very close to an agreement
 
01:51:11.810 --> 01:51:11.820 align:start position:0%
that would satisfy the people on this
 
01:51:14.930 --> 01:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
committee who have doubts and lack trust
 
01:51:17.689 --> 01:51:17.699 align:start position:0%
in in this bill but I think we're close
 
01:51:21.169 --> 01:51:21.179 align:start position:0%
and I I think given our willingness to
 
01:51:22.970 --> 01:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
work in a bipartisan fashion as we've
 
01:51:25.010 --> 01:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
seen today that we ought to set
 
01:51:26.990 --> 01:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
something up also we heard yesterday in
 
01:51:28.490 --> 01:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
committee that there's a bit of a state
 
01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
of emergency in the energy market so we
 
01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
should be working in a timely fashion to
 
01:51:35.290 --> 01:51:35.300 align:start position:0%
get something passed
 
01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
so I think we should put our money where
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
our mouths are speaking from my side of
 
01:51:42.410 --> 01:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
the aisle I think it's time that we
 
01:51:44.510 --> 01:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
maybe uh we've been talking about
 
01:51:46.850 --> 01:51:46.860 align:start position:0%
Renewables being the most cost effective
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
choice for a long time and I think we
 
01:51:51.530 --> 01:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
need to trust that this is a moment now
 
01:51:54.109 --> 01:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
that we might be able to start to see
 
01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
that and I think from the other side of
 
01:51:56.930 --> 01:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
the aisle you've been talking about
 
01:51:59.930 --> 01:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
cost Effectiveness and pricing criteria
 
01:52:02.689 --> 01:52:02.699 align:start position:0%
being the the sole guideline or the main
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
priority when it comes to policy making
 
01:52:07.970 --> 01:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
so again uh you need to put your your
 
01:52:09.410 --> 01:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
money where your mouths are so I think
 
01:52:11.450 --> 01:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
in a bipartisan fashion we could start
 
01:52:13.129 --> 01:52:13.139 align:start position:0%
to work uh work our way through this
 
01:52:15.709 --> 01:52:15.719 align:start position:0%
bill and um
 
01:52:17.570 --> 01:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
write the apple cart of the energy
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
Market which is already being disrupted
 
01:52:22.729 --> 01:52:22.739 align:start position:0%
as we speak and so um this is this bill
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
is an effort to to try to seize the
 
01:52:27.169 --> 01:52:27.179 align:start position:0%
moment it is a sea change it is a big
 
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
Bill but it's an important move for the
 
01:52:31.609 --> 01:52:31.619 align:start position:0%
state and it's uh we owe it to our we
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
owe it to the Senate who worked in a
 
01:52:35.090 --> 01:52:35.100 align:start position:0%
bipartisan fashion to craft this we owe
 
01:52:37.370 --> 01:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
it to our constituents to try to do
 
01:52:40.370 --> 01:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
something about electricity rates and
 
01:52:42.169 --> 01:52:42.179 align:start position:0%
for many of us it's a priority issue so
 
01:52:46.129 --> 01:52:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:48.169 --> 01:52:48.179 align:start position:0%
additional discussion representative
 
01:52:51.649 --> 01:52:51.659 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman yes so yeah
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
I when I think about this bill I think
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
that it's uh its purpose is also for
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
Price stabilization uh because it would
 
01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
provide a backstop on pricing
 
01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
as a about to be
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
customer of community power I am
 
01:53:07.609 --> 01:53:07.619 align:start position:0%
concerned about the effect on community
 
01:53:10.669 --> 01:53:10.679 align:start position:0%
power and I would like to see us do what
 
01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
we can to make this bill not hurt
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
Community power representative McGee
 
01:53:18.649 --> 01:53:18.659 align:start position:0%
called me last night and and mentioned
 
01:53:21.530 --> 01:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee idea to me and asked if
 
01:53:24.109 --> 01:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
I would be willing to serve on it and if
 
01:53:27.410 --> 01:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
I am asked to I I am willing
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Wendy Thomas
 
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you um I just want
 
01:53:35.810 --> 01:53:35.820 align:start position:0%
to um so we're recessing this as opposed
 
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
to retaining it is that because we think
 
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
that we're close to a resolution and we
 
01:53:41.629 --> 01:53:41.639 align:start position:0%
want to get it onto the floor before the
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
end of this session that is correct okay
 
01:53:46.250 --> 01:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you if we retain the bill it
 
01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't come to the floor till next fall
 
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
our next January basically
 
01:53:54.890 --> 01:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
but if we just recess this exact session
 
01:53:58.010 --> 01:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
then we can resume the exact session at
 
01:54:00.649 --> 01:54:00.659 align:start position:0%
a time and date to be noticed in the
 
01:54:03.950 --> 01:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
calendar and move the bill forward this
 
01:54:06.410 --> 01:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
session this spring
 
01:54:08.930 --> 01:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
so that would be the goal of doing a
 
01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:11.580 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative McGee yes
 
01:54:13.609 --> 01:54:13.619 align:start position:0%
and before we go forward with voting on
 
01:54:15.709 --> 01:54:15.719 align:start position:0%
whether to form one I just wanted to put
 
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
out there to the committee that one of
 
01:54:20.450 --> 01:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
the things that I suggested uh to
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
Chairman Vose was that we by way a
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
process try to put out a question to all
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
of you to try and let us know
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
submit to to us what your concerns are
 
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
with the bill so that we know that we're
 
01:54:37.010 --> 01:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
um addressing all of them in our
 
01:54:38.570 --> 01:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
attempts to review it I mean we're going
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
to review it anyway but I think there
 
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
are certain things that stick out
 
01:54:45.950 --> 01:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
um to different of our members and so we
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
would like to have everyone's concerns
 
01:54:50.330 --> 01:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
um addressed in that subcommittee and it
 
01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
would also expediate the process if we
 
01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
had a list of questions we were trying
 
01:54:57.410 --> 01:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
to solve for so if you have ideas about
 
01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
like the suggestion that representative
 
01:55:02.270 --> 01:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
Summers made about his position on lines
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
18 and 19. we we would like to collect
 
01:55:06.649 --> 01:55:06.659 align:start position:0%
that information just to make the work
 
01:55:09.050 --> 01:55:09.060 align:start position:0%
more Speedy thanks
 
01:55:10.609 --> 01:55:10.619 align:start position:0%
so I'm getting a sense that the
 
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
committee is interested in pursuing this
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
option but to be absolutely sure could I
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
see a show of hands who from individuals
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative Arrington has a question
 
01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:24.050 align:start position:0%
representative Arrington has a question
first

01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:24.060 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
I just want to know if let's just say we
 
01:55:27.530 --> 01:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
have this and we have that one day
 
01:55:30.169 --> 01:55:30.179 align:start position:0%
meeting next week and and it still
 
01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't come to Felician so is this
 
01:55:34.729 --> 01:55:34.739 align:start position:0%
still the option then to retain the bill
 
01:55:37.370 --> 01:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
sure as long as the executive session is
 
01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
still open which it would be then retain
 
01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
would still be because one thing I think
 
01:55:43.010 --> 01:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
we need to hear more from is where the
 
01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
puc is where they're doing with this and
 
01:55:46.129 --> 01:55:46.139 align:start position:0%
where they're going and how they think
 
01:55:47.629 --> 01:55:47.639 align:start position:0%
it's going to work and so forth because
 
01:55:49.550 --> 01:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
obviously they've been involved in this
 
01:55:51.709 --> 01:55:51.719 align:start position:0%
stuff before and it's going to have an
 
01:55:54.770 --> 01:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
impact on you know on them directly so
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
that way I don't think we heard from the
 
01:55:59.689 --> 01:55:59.699 align:start position:0%
chair of the puc on this yet have we
 
01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
okay sure the chair of the puc did
 
01:56:04.609 --> 01:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
anyone from the puc speak on this on the
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
public hearing I wasn't here for the
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
first no I guess I was here for it they
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
weren't no only the department of energy
 
01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:17.629 --> 01:56:17.639 align:start position:0%
all right so to be sure in my mind that
 
01:56:21.169 --> 01:56:21.179 align:start position:0%
my sense of a consensus is correct I
 
01:56:22.669 --> 01:56:22.679 align:start position:0%
would like to see a show of hands of
 
01:56:23.930 --> 01:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
people who would like to form a
 
01:56:26.810 --> 01:56:26.820 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and recess the exact
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
session on Senate bill 54.
 
01:56:35.810 --> 01:56:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
so it looks like we have a consensus so
 
01:56:39.890 --> 01:56:39.900 align:start position:0%
that is the direction in which we will
 
01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:41.450 align:start position:0%
that is the direction in which we will
move

01:56:41.450 --> 01:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
move
 
01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
so representative McGee and I move the
 
01:56:47.810 --> 01:56:47.820 align:start position:0%
formation of a subcommittee for Senate
 
01:56:51.050 --> 01:56:51.060 align:start position:0%
bill 64. that's 54 rather
 
01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:54.590 align:start position:0%
bill 64. that's 54 rather
and

01:56:54.590 --> 01:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
I would like to
 
01:56:58.490 --> 01:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
appoint the following people to the
 
01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:00.169 align:start position:0%
appoint the following people to the
committee

01:57:00.169 --> 01:57:00.179 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:57:03.229 --> 01:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
representative Corman representative
 
01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
Bernardi representative McGee
 
01:57:08.090 --> 01:57:08.100 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington and
 
01:57:10.970 --> 01:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
representative Vose
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
without objection
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
those folks will be the subcommittee for
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 54.
 
01:57:19.490 --> 01:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
excuse me what day is this going to be
 
01:57:22.729 --> 01:57:22.739 align:start position:0%
Monday April 24th will be the
 
01:57:25.129 --> 01:57:25.139 align:start position:0%
meeting of the subcommittee
 
01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
I'm in Portsmouth that afternoon for an
 
01:57:29.089 --> 01:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
offshore wind commission hearing what
 
01:57:29.099 --> 01:57:30.050 align:start position:0%
offshore wind commission hearing what
time

01:57:30.050 --> 01:57:30.060 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:57:32.089 --> 01:57:32.099 align:start position:0%
4 30 but I'm not driving out here and
 
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
driving all the way back over there so
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
you have to find somebody else on that
 
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:36.770 align:start position:0%
you have to find somebody else on that
one

01:57:36.770 --> 01:57:36.780 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:57:39.530 --> 01:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
okay so well scratch representative
 
01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:42.950 align:start position:0%
okay so well scratch representative
Harrington

01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
yes nine o'clock in the morning
 
01:57:49.250 --> 01:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
so representative Thomas
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
I'll be going to the same ultra wind
 
01:57:59.530 --> 01:57:59.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:01.209 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:58:01.209 --> 01:58:01.219 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:58:03.649 --> 01:58:03.659 align:start position:0%
so I'd make sure 18 and 19 aren't in
 
01:58:03.659 --> 01:58:07.010 align:start position:0%
so I'd make sure 18 and 19 aren't in
there

01:58:07.010 --> 01:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:08.570 --> 01:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:58:13.010 --> 01:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
Bose McGee Bernardi Corman and Summers
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative Kaplan just
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
wondering I mean this is a split
 
01:58:19.010 --> 01:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
committee 1010 why why wouldn't the
 
01:58:21.050 --> 01:58:21.060 align:start position:0%
subcommittee also be equally split
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
between the the two parties side you
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
know just just a question to process
 
01:58:27.470 --> 01:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's impossible to come up with an even
 
01:58:29.330 --> 01:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
split when you need an odd number of
 
01:58:29.340 --> 01:58:31.490 align:start position:0%
split when you need an odd number of
people

01:58:31.490 --> 01:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:58:34.010 --> 01:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
mathematically can't work
 
01:58:37.070 --> 01:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
so remember what a subcommittee does is
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
it asks questions compiles information
 
01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
and then makes a decision about a
 
01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation or a series of
 
01:58:48.169 --> 01:58:48.179 align:start position:0%
recommendations to make to the full
 
01:58:48.179 --> 01:58:49.430 align:start position:0%
recommendations to make to the full
committee

01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:58:51.530 --> 01:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
so the subcommittee will come back to us
 
01:58:53.450 --> 01:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
and say
 
01:58:56.270 --> 01:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
we recommend
 
01:58:59.810 --> 01:58:59.820 align:start position:0%
that you amend Senate Bill 54 in these
 
01:59:01.550 --> 01:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
three ways
 
01:59:03.410 --> 01:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
and the committee itself the full
 
01:59:05.629 --> 01:59:05.639 align:start position:0%
committee can say yes or no to that
 
01:59:05.639 --> 01:59:07.010 align:start position:0%
committee can say yes or no to that
recommendation

01:59:07.010 --> 01:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
or it could even modify the
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation and say okay we'll take
 
01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
two of those
 
01:59:15.950 --> 01:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
will reject one and we'll add one of our
 
01:59:18.050 --> 01:59:18.060 align:start position:0%
own you know that's that's the kind of
 
01:59:20.169 --> 01:59:20.179 align:start position:0%
thing that can happen
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
so that's what the subcommittee process
 
01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
is supposed to that's how it's supposed
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
to work
 
01:59:28.970 --> 01:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
and you have to have a an odd number of
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
people on a subcommittee so that there
 
01:59:32.870 --> 01:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
won't be tie votes if you end up voting
 
01:59:34.490 --> 01:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
on something
 
01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:35.570 align:start position:0%
on something
so

01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
that's the uh that's the strategy we'll
 
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:45.410 --> 01:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
so given that I will now recess the
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
public the executive session on Senate
 
01:59:51.649 --> 01:59:51.659 align:start position:0%
Bill 54 to a time and date to be noticed
 
02:00:03.290 --> 02:00:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
and I will schedule a subcommittee
 
02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:06.169 align:start position:0%
and I will schedule a subcommittee
meeting

02:00:06.169 --> 02:00:06.179 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:00:07.790 --> 02:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
I will chair the subcommittee and I'll
 
02:00:11.089 --> 02:00:11.099 align:start position:0%
schedule a meeting for Monday April 24th
 
02:00:15.649 --> 02:00:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:18.830 --> 02:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
here yes in this room
 
02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:20.330 align:start position:0%
here yes in this room
and

02:00:20.330 --> 02:00:20.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
to be clear
 
02:00:25.490 --> 02:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
even though there are five members of
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee every member of this
 
02:00:29.870 --> 02:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
committee is
 
02:00:33.050 --> 02:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
welcome and eligible to attend the
 
02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:34.370 align:start position:0%
welcome and eligible to attend the
meeting

02:00:34.370 --> 02:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:00:36.410 --> 02:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
and to sit at this table and ask
 
02:00:39.470 --> 02:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
questions if you have them
 
02:00:42.410 --> 02:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
so even though the five members of the
 
02:00:44.530 --> 02:00:44.540 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will actually form
 
02:00:47.570 --> 02:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
formulate the recommendations that we
 
02:00:49.010 --> 02:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
will prevent present to the full
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee the full committee is welcome
 
02:00:55.370 --> 02:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
to attend if you so desire
 
02:00:58.910 --> 02:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
it is a public meeting so
 
02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
the public is invited to the meeting as
 
02:01:00.900 --> 02:01:01.729 align:start position:0%
the public is invited to the meeting as
well

02:01:01.729 --> 02:01:01.739 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:01:04.129 --> 02:01:04.139 align:start position:0%
to listen to the questions that get
 
02:01:04.139 --> 02:01:05.089 align:start position:0%
to listen to the questions that get
asked

02:01:05.089 --> 02:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
asked
 
02:01:07.370 --> 02:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
and the deliberations that the committee
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
ends up making I anticipate that it'll
 
02:01:12.589 --> 02:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
be a pretty full day
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
the morning will probably be spent
 
02:01:15.770 --> 02:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
asking questions and then the afternoon
 
02:01:17.689 --> 02:01:17.699 align:start position:0%
will probably be spent
 
02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
deliberating well what do we do with the
 
02:01:21.770 --> 02:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
information we gained
 
02:01:24.530 --> 02:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
what amendments are we going to
 
02:01:24.540 --> 02:01:25.550 align:start position:0%
what amendments are we going to
recommend

02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:28.250 align:start position:0%
recommend
Etc

02:01:28.250 --> 02:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
any other questions about how the
 
02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.050 --> 02:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
okay I guess we're done with that then
 
02:01:42.410 --> 02:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
so we're recessed on Senate bill 54. we
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
can now move on to Senate bill 68.
 
02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes representative
 
02:02:02.689 --> 02:02:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:08.770 --> 02:02:08.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative merner
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
I second the motion Mr chairman moved
 
02:02:17.089 --> 02:02:17.099 align:start position:0%
and seconded that we itl Senate Bill
 
02:02:17.099 --> 02:02:19.850 align:start position:0%
and seconded that we itl Senate Bill
5868

02:02:19.850 --> 02:02:19.860 align:start position:0%
5868
 
02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:22.679 align:start position:0%
and uh chair recognizes representative
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
Bernardi to
 
02:02:28.189 --> 02:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
a discussions motion
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
yes uh Mr chairman as as we've discussed
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
in the hearing
 
02:02:36.649 --> 02:02:36.659 align:start position:0%
um what what we're doing here is
 
02:02:40.669 --> 02:02:40.679 align:start position:0%
continuing this continues to expand the
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
concept of uh of
 
02:02:47.870 --> 02:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
making net metering available to a
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
larger and larger group of subgroup of
 
02:02:52.850 --> 02:02:52.860 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
potential customers and uh we we did
 
02:02:59.589 --> 02:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
that initially for
 
02:03:02.689 --> 02:03:02.699 align:start position:0%
municipalities where the net metering
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
benefit went back to the taxpayers of
 
02:03:08.089 --> 02:03:08.099 align:start position:0%
those municipalities in in these
 
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
subsequent bills
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
um that is not the circumstance that
 
02:03:17.649 --> 02:03:17.659 align:start position:0%
obtains so uh it it is that sort of
 
02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
unrestricted growth is not well uh we
 
02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
should be doing
 
02:03:26.570 --> 02:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion I'll remind
 
02:03:29.169 --> 02:03:29.179 align:start position:0%
the members that we did
 
02:03:34.209 --> 02:03:34.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:36.890 --> 02:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
hb139 which came out of committee
 
02:03:38.689 --> 02:03:38.699 align:start position:0%
without recommendation and then was
 
02:03:42.589 --> 02:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
passed on the house floor and so the
 
02:03:45.229 --> 02:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
position of itl of
 
02:03:47.689 --> 02:03:47.699 align:start position:0%
the Republican caucus is consistent with
 
02:03:50.209 --> 02:03:50.219 align:start position:0%
our position on hb-139
 
02:03:53.209 --> 02:03:53.219 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:03:55.850 --> 02:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
representative McGee I guess I'll just
 
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
add this by way of explanation
 
02:03:59.810 --> 02:03:59.820 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think
 
02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:00.790 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think
um

02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:03.290 --> 02:04:03.300 align:start position:0%
originally we had heard since there were
 
02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
two vehicles that were very similar one
 
02:04:08.209 --> 02:04:08.219 align:start position:0%
on each side of the wall that perhaps
 
02:04:10.490 --> 02:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
the one that was coming to us SB 68
 
02:04:14.089 --> 02:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
would be the one that would be preferred
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
for passage but I think it's actually
 
02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:17.870 align:start position:0%
for passage but I think it's actually
um

02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
you know at this point it's it's the
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
other way I I think HB 39 did make it
 
02:04:25.550 --> 02:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
through the house and the Senate is is
 
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
looking at passing it on their side so
 
02:04:31.970 --> 02:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we you know have any
 
02:04:33.530 --> 02:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
further jurisdiction over that
 
02:04:36.109 --> 02:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
particular bill but in this one I think
 
02:04:37.370 --> 02:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
02:04:39.589 --> 02:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary
 
02:04:45.649 --> 02:04:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.810 --> 02:04:47.820 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
02:04:49.370 --> 02:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
the role on the question of itl on
 
02:04:52.850 --> 02:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 68.

buy a vote of 19-1 the adoption the

motion of itl is adopted on Senate bill
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%

68. without objection we'll put this on
the

02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
seeing and hearing no consent this will
 
02:05:58.490 --> 02:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
go on the consent calendar and
 
02:06:01.970 --> 02:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi will write the
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:08.689 --> 02:06:08.699 align:start position:0%

02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
session on Senate bill 68.
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
it is now 1105 we have two bills to go
 
02:06:17.209 --> 02:06:17.219 align:start position:0%
so I'll open the executive session on
 
02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 69.
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
relative to allowing certain non-profits
 
02:06:24.530 --> 02:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
to participate as customer generator
 
02:06:26.810 --> 02:06:26.820 align:start position:0%
group hosts under net energy metering
 
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
and I'll recognize representative
 
02:06:32.750 --> 02:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:35.209 --> 02:06:35.219 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to legislate
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative is recognized I second
 
02:06:43.010 --> 02:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
ICL on SB 69. it's moved and seconded
 
02:06:46.970 --> 02:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
that we itl Senate bill 69.
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes representative
 
02:06:49.679 --> 02:06:54.350 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes representative
Harrington

02:06:54.350 --> 02:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:57.169 --> 02:06:57.179 align:start position:0%
this is just another expansion of the
 
02:06:59.450 --> 02:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
net metering process that we started we
 
02:07:01.550 --> 02:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
originally it was supposed to be up to
 
02:07:03.890 --> 02:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
one megawatt and then we decided okay
 
02:07:07.070 --> 02:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
well we'll allow municipalities to go up
 
02:07:09.649 --> 02:07:09.659 align:start position:0%
is from one to five with the idea that
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
if they saved money on the electric bill
 
02:07:14.450 --> 02:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
the tax payers would save money now
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about doing it to multiple
 
02:07:18.050 --> 02:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
non-profit groups and as people had
 
02:07:20.270 --> 02:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned before they're one of the
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
largest employees in the state so this
 
02:07:23.570 --> 02:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
could really expand we could be talking
 
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
about hundreds of megawatts of power
 
02:07:28.189 --> 02:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
which is net metered which means again
 
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
it has no obligation to deliver power at
 
02:07:33.589 --> 02:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
any time when they have the power it has
 
02:07:35.209 --> 02:07:35.219 align:start position:0%
to be bought at the net meter in price
 
02:07:37.550 --> 02:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
when they don't Supply the power maybe
 
02:07:38.810 --> 02:07:38.820 align:start position:0%
when it's really needed something
 
02:07:40.609 --> 02:07:40.619 align:start position:0%
certainly like and we all talk about the
 
02:07:42.470 --> 02:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
winter time here and how desperate we
 
02:07:44.330 --> 02:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
are for electricity in the winter you're
 
02:07:46.609 --> 02:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
not going to get much out of solar uh
 
02:07:49.070 --> 02:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
when it's a real cold morning in January
 
02:07:51.410 --> 02:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
or if it's snowing out for example
 
02:07:54.350 --> 02:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
so we just keep pushing it a little bit
 
02:07:56.209 --> 02:07:56.219 align:start position:0%
more we open the door now we're going to
 
02:07:57.589 --> 02:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
be and then we have another bill that
 
02:07:59.810 --> 02:07:59.820 align:start position:0%
says basically anybody can do it I think
 
02:08:02.330 --> 02:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
we should leave the the line where it's
 
02:08:04.609 --> 02:08:04.619 align:start position:0%
been drawn whereas municipalities only
 
02:08:07.070 --> 02:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
because that way there is a direct
 
02:08:09.169 --> 02:08:09.179 align:start position:0%
saving to to taxpayers on that and let's
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
face it everybody that lives somewhere
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
pays property taxes one way or the other
 
02:08:16.850 --> 02:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
so I just don't see this and it's just
 
02:08:18.890 --> 02:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
going to exacerbate the problem we could
 
02:08:21.410 --> 02:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
end up like I say hundreds of megawatts
 
02:08:24.589 --> 02:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
of solar that has no obligation to serve
 
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
at any particular time and that means
 
02:08:28.970 --> 02:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to have more Reserve
 
02:08:31.310 --> 02:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
power to back that up and the iso always
 
02:08:32.870 --> 02:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
going to pay those people to have
 
02:08:35.089 --> 02:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
Reserve power to be there just in case
 
02:08:37.609 --> 02:08:37.619 align:start position:0%
not running but just in case and of
 
02:08:38.930 --> 02:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
course that's going to be passed on 100
 
02:08:42.589 --> 02:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the discussion
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:50.930 --> 02:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
I'm yeah I think I'm just going to use
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
an analogy to try to argue in favor of
 
02:08:55.490 --> 02:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
this bill I mean we're trying to build a
 
02:08:57.169 --> 02:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
bridge to the Future and we're halfway
 
02:08:59.810 --> 02:08:59.820 align:start position:0%
across the bridge and we're calling a
 
02:09:02.589 --> 02:09:02.599 align:start position:0%
pause on construction of that bridge
 
02:09:06.109 --> 02:09:06.119 align:start position:0%
yes solar energy is intermittent and it
 
02:09:09.010 --> 02:09:09.020 align:start position:0%
has problems but uh they're not
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
they're not unsolvable problems and
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
we need to do as much as we can to
 
02:09:17.450 --> 02:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
diversify our energy our generating
 
02:09:20.810 --> 02:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
sources in order to lower prices uh
 
02:09:22.609 --> 02:09:22.619 align:start position:0%
because of our dependence on natural gas
 
02:09:24.169 --> 02:09:24.179 align:start position:0%
and so this is one way of doing it it's
 
02:09:25.970 --> 02:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
not perfect but it's the way we've
 
02:09:28.910 --> 02:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
started and uh as you said or somebody
 
02:09:31.550 --> 02:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned non-profits or a huge source
 
02:09:33.649 --> 02:09:33.659 align:start position:0%
of uh economic activity in our state and
 
02:09:35.510 --> 02:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
we should be doing what we can to help
 
02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:38.870 align:start position:0%
we should be doing what we can to help
them

02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:42.109 --> 02:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
02:09:46.129 --> 02:09:46.139 align:start position:0%
so to follow up on uh representative
 
02:09:48.649 --> 02:09:48.659 align:start position:0%
kaplan's statement what we want to do is
 
02:09:50.689 --> 02:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
build a bridge to the Future that will
 
02:09:52.250 --> 02:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
be there some days
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:58.250 --> 02:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question or
 
02:10:00.890 --> 02:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
a comment thank you Mr chairman uh yeah
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
a couple of things I would I would say
 
02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:03.830 align:start position:0%
a couple of things I would I would say
um

02:10:03.830 --> 02:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:05.629 --> 02:10:05.639 align:start position:0%
you know I was thinking last night about
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's comments
 
02:10:10.129 --> 02:10:10.139 align:start position:0%
representative berezny actually prompted
 
02:10:11.450 --> 02:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
me to think of him thank you
 
02:10:14.089 --> 02:10:14.099 align:start position:0%
representative and one thing I think
 
02:10:16.910 --> 02:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
about is the amount of solar compared
 
02:10:18.649 --> 02:10:18.659 align:start position:0%
with the base load that we already have
 
02:10:20.330 --> 02:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't seem like that much
 
02:10:23.209 --> 02:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
certainly not in the near term
 
02:10:25.070 --> 02:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
um and then I'll just repeat something I
 
02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
said yesterday when we were discussing
 
02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
this bill in the work session which is
 
02:10:32.930 --> 02:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
I'm involved with a non-profit and of
 
02:10:34.609 --> 02:10:34.619 align:start position:0%
course as representative munz pointed
 
02:10:36.290 --> 02:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
out the nonprofit sector is a huge
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
employer in the state but I am directly
 
02:10:40.010 --> 02:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
involved with the non-profit as a board
 
02:10:42.109 --> 02:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
member and actually I was the grant
 
02:10:44.810 --> 02:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
writer I know how hard it is for
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
non-profits to survive financially and I
 
02:10:50.330 --> 02:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
feel like this is something that we can
 
02:10:53.089 --> 02:10:53.099 align:start position:0%
do to help non-profits and the question
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
was also raised well uh this is not
 
02:10:58.669 --> 02:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
really helping the the rate payers and
 
02:11:00.770 --> 02:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers but when you look at who
 
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
the non-profits are helping throughout
 
02:11:05.570 --> 02:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
the state it's a lot of people not just
 
02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
the people that work for the non-profits
 
02:11:09.770 --> 02:11:09.780 align:start position:0%
or with the nonprofits it's a lot of
 
02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
people and I feel like the benefit of
 
02:11:14.330 --> 02:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
this actually can spread out across a
 
02:11:17.330 --> 02:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
huge swath of the state
 
02:11:19.790 --> 02:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
additional discussion representative
 
02:11:22.370 --> 02:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
Reynolds has a question or comment
 
02:11:24.890 --> 02:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh yes thank
 
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
you representative Corman for pointing
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
that out this bill course it represents
 
02:11:32.629 --> 02:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
an expansion of the eligibility
 
02:11:35.390 --> 02:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
for all of our state's nonprofits to
 
02:11:38.810 --> 02:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
take advantage of low-cost solar which
 
02:11:40.070 --> 02:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
would help
 
02:11:42.830 --> 02:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of people across the state and I
 
02:11:45.229 --> 02:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
just need to respond to
 
02:11:45.239 --> 02:11:45.890 align:start position:0%
just need to respond to
um

02:11:45.890 --> 02:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:48.050 --> 02:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's you know
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
repeated characterization of of solar
 
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
that it's not reliable it doesn't have
 
02:11:55.250 --> 02:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
an obligation to serve he's not wrong
 
02:11:57.229 --> 02:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
about that but it's it's really
 
02:12:00.109 --> 02:12:00.119 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to the question
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
um the characteristics of solar are what
 
02:12:03.729 --> 02:12:03.739 align:start position:0%
they are
 
02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
and we've been
 
02:12:10.129 --> 02:12:10.139 align:start position:0%
shown by the repeated testimony New
 
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
England power generators Association
 
02:12:15.010 --> 02:12:15.020 align:start position:0%
utilities that solar in the aggregate
 
02:12:19.370 --> 02:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
already makes a substantial reduction in
 
02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
demand across the region and that
 
02:12:24.290 --> 02:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
reduction in demand has benefits for
 
02:12:27.109 --> 02:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
ratepayers so we ought to continue to do
 
02:12:29.689 --> 02:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
things that allow private investors to
 
02:12:31.129 --> 02:12:31.139 align:start position:0%
build more solar
 
02:12:33.410 --> 02:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
no solar's not dispatchable doesn't have
 
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
an obligation to serve but the natural
 
02:12:39.649 --> 02:12:39.659 align:start position:0%
gas plants are dispatchable and to the
 
02:12:41.330 --> 02:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
extent that um
 
02:12:42.890 --> 02:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
you know they can be turned on when
 
02:12:46.490 --> 02:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
needed so since natural gas is a limited
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
resource pipeline capacity into New
 
02:12:50.270 --> 02:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New England is limited why
 
02:12:52.669 --> 02:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we save the natural gas for
 
02:12:54.530 --> 02:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
when we really need it and have people
 
02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
build solar so that when it is
 
02:12:58.370 --> 02:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
generating and contributes to the grid
 
02:13:01.370 --> 02:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
it can be taken advantage of so it's
 
02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:02.629 align:start position:0%
it can be taken advantage of so it's
it's

02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
a sort of a false choice that that
 
02:13:07.189 --> 02:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington is is uh
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
is presenting us with we ought to do
 
02:13:11.390 --> 02:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
this and we ought to do it for the
 
02:13:14.569 --> 02:13:14.579 align:start position:0%
industrial as well thank you so since
 
02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
you called out representative Harrington
 
02:13:17.930 --> 02:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
I'll call on him
 
02:13:20.030 --> 02:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you just just to clarify the
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
difference between these when you talk
 
02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
about natural gas plants I know of none
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
that have that are almost none that are
 
02:13:28.189 --> 02:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
under five megawatts so they were all
 
02:13:30.290 --> 02:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
dispatchable plants controlled by ISO
 
02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
New England so the way it works is
 
02:13:33.890 --> 02:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
they'll bid in on it on a particular
 
02:13:35.390 --> 02:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
hour that I'm going to deliver 100
 
02:13:37.790 --> 02:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
megawatts of power and if that clears
 
02:13:40.189 --> 02:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
then they deliver the power now if that
 
02:13:42.050 --> 02:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
particular day there's a lot of solar
 
02:13:44.209 --> 02:13:44.219 align:start position:0%
being produced and ISO New England says
 
02:13:46.850 --> 02:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
we don't need your 100 megawatts well
 
02:13:48.890 --> 02:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
they're going to say too bad you're
 
02:13:50.569 --> 02:13:50.579 align:start position:0%
going to pay me for them anyways that's
 
02:13:51.890 --> 02:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
the way it works just because there's
 
02:13:54.050 --> 02:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
extra sold that's not dispatchable now
 
02:13:56.209 --> 02:13:56.219 align:start position:0%
if it's a utility grade solar that's 50
 
02:13:58.010 --> 02:13:58.020 align:start position:0%
megawatts or something they'll have an
 
02:13:59.870 --> 02:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
obligation to sell their electricity and
 
02:14:02.209 --> 02:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
deliver it but if someone is Bid in and
 
02:14:03.830 --> 02:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
cleared the market and it happens to be
 
02:14:05.689 --> 02:14:05.699 align:start position:0%
an exceptionally sunny day or a day that
 
02:14:07.010 --> 02:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
it was supposed to rain and it didn't
 
02:14:09.530 --> 02:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot more net metered solar
 
02:14:11.810 --> 02:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
around there it doesn't cut back on the
 
02:14:13.370 --> 02:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
you can't tell the natural gas plant
 
02:14:15.169 --> 02:14:15.179 align:start position:0%
sorry we're not gonna you can't run
 
02:14:16.490 --> 02:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
today because they've already bought
 
02:14:18.229 --> 02:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
their gas they're ready to go and
 
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
they've cleared the market and they're
 
02:14:21.410 --> 02:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
going to get paid that's just the way it
 
02:14:23.209 --> 02:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
works and if you tell them not to run
 
02:14:24.770 --> 02:14:24.780 align:start position:0%
then they're going to get paid anyways
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
you can't you can't it's two totally
 
02:14:29.450 --> 02:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
different things because one has a
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
commitment that they make and they clear
 
02:14:33.109 --> 02:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
the market the other one runs whenever
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
they whenever they can whenever they
 
02:14:36.290 --> 02:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
want them
 
02:14:38.990 --> 02:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki as a comment um
 
02:14:40.850 --> 02:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman you know we hear
 
02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
about the reliability must run and other
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
such plants and the thing is that the
 
02:14:48.290 --> 02:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
rate payers are paying for essentially
 
02:14:50.330 --> 02:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
that capacity
 
02:14:52.910 --> 02:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
um in excess of whatever the solar may
 
02:14:57.649 --> 02:14:57.659 align:start position:0%
do and uh until we have storage solar is
 
02:14:57.659 --> 02:14:58.669 align:start position:0%
do and uh until we have storage solar is
the

02:14:58.669 --> 02:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:01.069 --> 02:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
sometimes here sometimes not and we
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
heard about the Christmas Eve issue and
 
02:15:06.169 --> 02:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
the other one where we were running
 
02:15:08.569 --> 02:15:08.579 align:start position:0%
really low and we can't say hey solar
 
02:15:10.609 --> 02:15:10.619 align:start position:0%
come on you know Christmas Eve we need
 
02:15:12.050 --> 02:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
some juice right now it's four o'clock
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon it just doesn't work
 
02:15:16.609 --> 02:15:16.619 align:start position:0%
that way it can't be done
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a comment
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
yes I just just to uh round out what uh
 
02:15:25.970 --> 02:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
representatives lewicking and Harrington
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
are talking about
 
02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
um because solar is not reliable
 
02:15:32.830 --> 02:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
meaning dispatchable
 
02:15:37.370 --> 02:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
uh it does not reduce our overall demand
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the amount of power resources we need
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
there is never any solar during the
 
02:15:49.850 --> 02:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
winter Peak none absolutely zero because
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the winter Peak it is dark
 
02:15:58.010 --> 02:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
therefore we have to have another set of
 
02:16:01.390 --> 02:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
reliable power producers
 
02:16:04.669 --> 02:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
100 percent throughout the the whole
 
02:16:06.890 --> 02:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
year in order to in order to satisfy
 
02:16:09.290 --> 02:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
that Peak so basically what we're doing
 
02:16:12.169 --> 02:16:12.179 align:start position:0%
is saying we need to build out two
 
02:16:15.890 --> 02:16:15.900 align:start position:0%
sources of Power by this bill one solar
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
and one to cover the peak that doesn't
 
02:16:20.810 --> 02:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
make any sense we should not be
 
02:16:31.970 --> 02:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:35.830 --> 02:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh just to keep in mind how much space
 
02:16:38.929 --> 02:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
that solar Farms take up so if we wanted
 
02:16:40.730 --> 02:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
to replace all conventional power plants
 
02:16:41.810 --> 02:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
we would need
 
02:16:47.110 --> 02:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative cretian
 
02:16:50.929 --> 02:16:50.939 align:start position:0%
thank you um I just wanted to bring us
 
02:16:53.270 --> 02:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
back to the actual bill so this is only
 
02:16:56.690 --> 02:16:56.700 align:start position:0%
allowing non-profits in the state to
 
02:16:58.610 --> 02:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
participate as net metered host we are
 
02:17:00.349 --> 02:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
not talking about replacing all natural
 
02:17:04.129 --> 02:17:04.139 align:start position:0%
gas with solar we are not talking about
 
02:17:06.410 --> 02:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
anything the size of California this is
 
02:17:08.570 --> 02:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
just expanding it to a very small
 
02:17:11.209 --> 02:17:11.219 align:start position:0%
additional number of folks it will save
 
02:17:13.129 --> 02:17:13.139 align:start position:0%
on the peak we've heard testimony to
 
02:17:14.810 --> 02:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
that effect we've seen studies to that
 
02:17:16.129 --> 02:17:16.139 align:start position:0%
effect I don't think we should ignore
 
02:17:16.139 --> 02:17:17.209 align:start position:0%
effect I don't think we should ignore
that

02:17:17.209 --> 02:17:17.219 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:17:17.219 --> 02:17:17.990 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:19.849 --> 02:17:19.859 align:start position:0%
I think we're just getting getting far
 
02:17:22.790 --> 02:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
off of what the bill will do and into
 
02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
the sort of more controversial aspects
 
02:17:27.290 --> 02:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
of you know 100 renewable which is not
 
02:17:29.150 --> 02:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
what this is talking about
 
02:17:32.389 --> 02:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative murder yes I I agree with
 
02:17:35.629 --> 02:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
her on the the but there's a large large
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
amount of non-profits I can't even tell
 
02:17:40.009 --> 02:17:40.019 align:start position:0%
you how many just in the North Country
 
02:17:40.019 --> 02:17:41.270 align:start position:0%
you how many just in the North Country
Alone

02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
Alone
 
02:17:42.889 --> 02:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
um and to the point just to stay on
 
02:17:44.929 --> 02:17:44.939 align:start position:0%
point of the money
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
these going on you'd be surprised how
 
02:17:49.129 --> 02:17:49.139 align:start position:0%
many non-profits there are for that
 
02:17:51.049 --> 02:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
would jump on this boat the other thing
 
02:17:52.610 --> 02:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
we we don't understand when we talk
 
02:17:54.770 --> 02:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
about cost shifting or whatever we are
 
02:17:57.169 --> 02:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
paying millions of dollars to have these
 
02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
plants on standby right now Bo runs
 
02:18:01.849 --> 02:18:01.859 align:start position:0%
twice a year we could I could go on and
 
02:18:03.290 --> 02:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
on with all the plants that were on
 
02:18:05.089 --> 02:18:05.099 align:start position:0%
standby right now and what's going to
 
02:18:06.889 --> 02:18:06.899 align:start position:0%
have you know we still have to pay them
 
02:18:08.929 --> 02:18:08.939 align:start position:0%
because this is not reliable base load
 
02:18:11.929 --> 02:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
power and it will expand significantly
 
02:18:14.030 --> 02:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
with Dawn profits I'm sorry there is an
 
02:18:15.889 --> 02:18:15.899 align:start position:0%
awful lot out there and I'll just leave
 
02:18:17.629 --> 02:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
it at that
 
02:18:19.849 --> 02:18:19.859 align:start position:0%
to follow on to representative merner's
 
02:18:19.859 --> 02:18:22.009 align:start position:0%
to follow on to representative merner's
point

02:18:22.009 --> 02:18:22.019 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:18:23.810 --> 02:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
because there are a huge number of
 
02:18:25.969 --> 02:18:25.979 align:start position:0%
non-profits and I agree that many of
 
02:18:29.150 --> 02:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
them struggle to survive
 
02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
but this bill would open the door to
 
02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:32.290 align:start position:0%
but this bill would open the door to
allowing

02:18:32.290 --> 02:18:32.300 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
02:18:35.089 --> 02:18:35.099 align:start position:0%
consortiums or cooperatives of
 
02:18:40.610 --> 02:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
non-profits to join into the to this
 
02:18:42.650 --> 02:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
program of
 
02:18:45.370 --> 02:18:45.380 align:start position:0%
additional net readering because they're
 
02:18:49.250 --> 02:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
non-profits and that is a huge expansion
 
02:18:52.129 --> 02:18:52.139 align:start position:0%
potential expansion of the net metering
 
02:18:55.669 --> 02:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
work Marketplace when
 
02:18:57.889 --> 02:18:57.899 align:start position:0%
the public utilities Public Utilities
 
02:18:59.509 --> 02:18:59.519 align:start position:0%
Commission is still trying to figure out
 
02:19:02.030 --> 02:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
what the net metering tariff should be
 
02:19:03.530 --> 02:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
02:19:06.830 --> 02:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
and the doe opposes this bill because we
 
02:19:08.330 --> 02:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
they think we should wait do we know
 
02:19:11.150 --> 02:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
what that tariff is before we expand net
 
02:19:14.089 --> 02:19:14.099 align:start position:0%
metering any further
 
02:19:16.310 --> 02:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
so representative munz has a comment
 
02:19:20.389 --> 02:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I'm um I'm
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
encouraged that everyone on the
 
02:19:24.410 --> 02:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
committee seems to acknowledge that the
 
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
non-profit segment of our economy is is
 
02:19:31.209 --> 02:19:31.219 align:start position:0%
large and and very um
 
02:19:35.629 --> 02:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
important to the overall well-being of
 
02:19:35.639 --> 02:19:36.889 align:start position:0%
important to the overall well-being of
the

02:19:36.889 --> 02:19:36.899 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:39.950 --> 02:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
of the state and I I wanted to thank
 
02:19:42.110 --> 02:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
representative Corman for highlighting
 
02:19:45.410 --> 02:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
the fact that these non-profits serve a
 
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
very large segment of the population the
 
02:19:49.070 --> 02:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
only thing that I would add to his
 
02:19:51.770 --> 02:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
comment is that New Hampshire is unique
 
02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
among states and that we Outsource a lot
 
02:19:57.190 --> 02:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
of what our normal governmental
 
02:20:00.910 --> 02:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to non-profits
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
our social service system has been
 
02:20:07.270 --> 02:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
essentially outsourced to non-profits
 
02:20:10.929 --> 02:20:10.939 align:start position:0%
and um I think we have an obligation
 
02:20:13.969 --> 02:20:13.979 align:start position:0%
to assist those non-profits as much as
 
02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
we can to enable them to continue to be
 
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
able to function and fulfill the mission
 
02:20:21.230 --> 02:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
that we the state have asked them to
 
02:20:21.240 --> 02:20:22.849 align:start position:0%
that we the state have asked them to
fulfill

02:20:22.849 --> 02:20:22.859 align:start position:0%
fulfill
 
02:20:25.370 --> 02:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
so anything we can do to reduce their
 
02:20:27.770 --> 02:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
operating costs
 
02:20:31.130 --> 02:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
um will will be beneficial to them and
 
02:20:32.389 --> 02:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
quite frankly if they want to get
 
02:20:34.670 --> 02:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
together in consortiums that's that's
 
02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
the free market at work and I would
 
02:20:40.610 --> 02:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:20:44.450 --> 02:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
representative McGee
 
02:20:46.190 --> 02:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:49.969 --> 02:20:49.979 align:start position:0%
um so it clearly you know our differing
 
02:20:51.770 --> 02:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
perspectives on whether we should be
 
02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
enabling this portion of the clean
 
02:20:57.110 --> 02:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
energy or local energy Market uh is
 
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
going to continue to be disparate but
 
02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
what I would say is that uh on the on
 
02:21:06.889 --> 02:21:06.899 align:start position:0%
the issue of you know base load versus
 
02:21:09.770 --> 02:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
intermittent energy sources
 
02:21:12.349 --> 02:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
as was stated before those are the
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
characteristics and what ends up
 
02:21:16.190 --> 02:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
happening is if you have larger
 
02:21:18.290 --> 02:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
non-profits like hospitals and that sort
 
02:21:20.809 --> 02:21:20.819 align:start position:0%
of thing they may end up partnering in
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
such a way
 
02:21:25.610 --> 02:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
um as they will invest in storage in
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
order to accommodate being able to
 
02:21:30.830 --> 02:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
dispatch energy when needed so I think
 
02:21:34.190 --> 02:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
we're not here to prescribe how the
 
02:21:36.290 --> 02:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
market will interpret the laws and the
 
02:21:38.270 --> 02:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
policies that we put in place we're here
 
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
to figure out which policies work for
 
02:21:44.030 --> 02:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I think these bills
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
were this bill and the next bill were
 
02:21:48.290 --> 02:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
both put in for specific constituencies
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
who see themselves wanting to be enabled
 
02:21:53.630 --> 02:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
in that regard and want to lower their
 
02:21:56.690 --> 02:21:56.700 align:start position:0%
prices and I think you know it from my
 
02:21:58.730 --> 02:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
perspective there isn't a downside to
 
02:22:00.290 --> 02:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't matter what the Tariff
 
02:22:02.030 --> 02:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
is the Tariff will be what the Tariff
 
02:22:04.610 --> 02:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
will be the policy is whether or not
 
02:22:07.250 --> 02:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
these guys are allowed to lower their
 
02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
own costs if they so see fit and right
 
02:22:12.110 --> 02:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
now the only impediment they have to
 
02:22:16.429 --> 02:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:18.590 --> 02:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a comment
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:22:24.290 --> 02:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
this is a classic example of trying to
 
02:22:28.010 --> 02:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
pass a policy before we know how this
 
02:22:30.290 --> 02:22:30.300 align:start position:0%
policy is going to affect everybody and
 
02:22:32.570 --> 02:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
in reference to the puc is still doing
 
02:22:35.929 --> 02:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
work on tariffs we have no idea what
 
02:22:38.210 --> 02:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
this policy is going to do it may or may
 
02:22:41.110 --> 02:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
not be what we want or it may
 
02:22:45.290 --> 02:22:45.300 align:start position:0%
increase people's costs this policy I
 
02:22:47.690 --> 02:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
think is premature we need to wait till
 
02:22:52.450 --> 02:22:52.460 align:start position:0%
POC acts just like a doe has recommended
 
02:22:55.790 --> 02:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
02:22:59.349 --> 02:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
just a comment on representative McGee's
 
02:23:09.050 --> 02:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:12.530 --> 02:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
there is no impediment for any
 
02:23:15.710 --> 02:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
non-profit or any other organization to
 
02:23:20.230 --> 02:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
begin or build out solar or wind now
 
02:23:23.210 --> 02:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is should we be
 
02:23:27.190 --> 02:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:29.929 --> 02:23:29.939 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
02:23:32.389 --> 02:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
I just make a quick comment uh we use
 
02:23:34.670 --> 02:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
the word non-profit fairly Loosely and
 
02:23:37.309 --> 02:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't mean the United Fund or
 
02:23:39.650 --> 02:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
the YMCA there's an awful lot of
 
02:23:41.150 --> 02:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
non-profits in New Hampshire I believe
 
02:23:43.730 --> 02:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
the gun club I belong to is a non-profit
 
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
so when you start taking across the
 
02:23:47.809 --> 02:23:47.819 align:start position:0%
board there's all sorts of non-profits
 
02:23:50.030 --> 02:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
and they're not all out there spending
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
their days making the place a better
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
place for everybody to live so just be
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:59.690 --> 02:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
looks like we're probably not going to
 
02:24:01.849 --> 02:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
change each other's minds on this but
 
02:24:04.730 --> 02:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
I'll give representative Kaplan an
 
02:24:06.410 --> 02:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that
 
02:24:07.969 --> 02:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I don't think this is
 
02:24:09.290 --> 02:24:09.300 align:start position:0%
going to change anybody's mind but I
 
02:24:12.469 --> 02:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
just can't let the uh Let It Go without
 
02:24:14.570 --> 02:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
comment on on the question of terrorists
 
02:24:16.370 --> 02:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
I think that's a red herring I mean this
 
02:24:18.650 --> 02:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
bill is not setting the tariffs the
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
tariffs will be set by the puc and it's
 
02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
docket and that I assume will be
 
02:24:24.290 --> 02:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
retroactive to any bill that we might
 
02:24:27.469 --> 02:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
pass here so why you know why are we
 
02:24:29.770 --> 02:24:29.780 align:start position:0%
holding up action on something
 
02:24:32.090 --> 02:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
based on
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
we don't know the final cost I mean that
 
02:24:36.590 --> 02:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's not what this bill does
 
02:24:39.650 --> 02:24:39.660 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just allows net metering
 
02:24:42.830 --> 02:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
to be expanded to non-profits and I I
 
02:24:46.550 --> 02:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
think of you know non-profits as Prime
 
02:24:49.610 --> 02:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
candidates for for a program like this
 
02:24:55.490 --> 02:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:57.889 --> 02:24:57.899 align:start position:0%
I would comment that
 
02:24:59.450 --> 02:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
with all due respect to my good friend
 
02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
from Hollis
 
02:25:04.370 --> 02:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
a policy like this actually sets up
 
02:25:06.349 --> 02:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
barriers to the operation of the free
 
02:25:08.510 --> 02:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
market and I don't think that that's
 
02:25:11.450 --> 02:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
what we should be doing as a policy
 
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
committee is to
 
02:25:15.710 --> 02:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
creating impediments to the operation of
 
02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
a market which has proved to be very
 
02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:19.070 align:start position:0%
a market which has proved to be very
effective

02:25:19.070 --> 02:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
effective
 
02:25:22.849 --> 02:25:22.859 align:start position:0%
for 200 over 200 years in this country
 
02:25:26.450 --> 02:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
all right is any further comment on this
 
02:25:31.130 --> 02:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
motion to itl House Bill 69 seeing none
 
02:25:33.650 --> 02:25:33.660 align:start position:0%

is there any appetite on the committee

to retain this bill no
 
02:28:16.250 --> 02:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
one would hope not
 
02:28:19.969 --> 02:28:19.979 align:start position:0%
since we have a heavy load already
 
02:28:22.309 --> 02:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
so this bill will go to the floor of the
 
02:28:24.650 --> 02:28:24.660 align:start position:0%
house without recommendation
 
02:28:27.670 --> 02:28:27.680 align:start position:0%

all right one last bill to go well let
 
02:29:10.190 --> 02:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
me close the uh executive session on 69
 
02:29:14.030 --> 02:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
first now we'll open a executive session
 
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
on 79 Senate Bill 79
 
02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
which is a very similar Bill to the one
 
02:29:25.270 --> 02:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:28.849 --> 02:29:28.859 align:start position:0%
non-profits it opens the door to
 
02:29:28.859 --> 02:29:29.650 align:start position:0%
non-profits it opens the door to
um

02:29:29.650 --> 02:29:29.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:33.910 --> 02:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
an expansion of net metering via
 
02:29:37.490 --> 02:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
industrial entities
 
02:29:40.190 --> 02:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
which are somewhat defined in the bill
 
02:29:44.570 --> 02:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
although it is somewhat vague so
 
02:29:44.580 --> 02:29:45.349 align:start position:0%
although it is somewhat vague so
um

02:29:45.349 --> 02:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:48.130 --> 02:29:48.140 align:start position:0%
on this bill I'm going to call on
 
02:29:51.050 --> 02:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas thank you Mr
 
02:29:55.070 --> 02:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
chair I motion SB 79 itl
 
02:29:58.969 --> 02:29:58.979 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative closure
 
02:30:03.530 --> 02:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
I second the itl on SB 79 moved in
 
02:30:07.450 --> 02:30:07.460 align:start position:0%
seconded that we itl Senate bill 79.
 
02:30:09.950 --> 02:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Doug Thomas
 
02:30:12.290 --> 02:30:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair in addition to what
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
was discussed from the previous bill
 
02:30:16.690 --> 02:30:16.700 align:start position:0%
this is a case of
 
02:30:19.490 --> 02:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
for-profit organizations that would be
 
02:30:22.130 --> 02:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
profiting from this bill at the expense
 
02:30:24.770 --> 02:30:24.780 align:start position:0%
of our rate payers I don't believe
 
02:30:27.889 --> 02:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
that's a particularly fair and for that
 
02:30:32.270 --> 02:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
reason uh we should I tell this bill
 
02:30:34.610 --> 02:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:30:37.370 --> 02:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki uh thank you Mr
 
02:30:40.429 --> 02:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
chairman and this applies to both bills
 
02:30:43.309 --> 02:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
reductio Adam certum is a valid logical
 
02:30:45.710 --> 02:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
proof taking things to the extreme and
 
02:30:47.330 --> 02:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
saying well what happens if everybody
 
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
goes uh solar or whatever whatever and
 
02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
we still have to maintain base load it
 
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any difference whether we
 
02:30:57.230 --> 02:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
are talking about it at just one level
 
02:30:59.929 --> 02:30:59.939 align:start position:0%
or you know some small one but that
 
02:31:03.650 --> 02:31:03.660 align:start position:0%
reduction is a valid proof and if it is
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
true for uh at the extreme it's also
 
02:31:11.389 --> 02:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
true for a limited case
 
02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
thank you good point
 
02:31:16.490 --> 02:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
additional discussion on the motion of
 
02:31:19.550 --> 02:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
Ito representative closure
 
02:31:23.230 --> 02:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
as we've seen the RSA
 
02:31:27.110 --> 02:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
362. it's been enacted for uh what's the
 
02:31:29.929 --> 02:31:29.939 align:start position:0%
title it limited limited electrical
 
02:31:32.210 --> 02:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
energy producers Act
 
02:31:34.370 --> 02:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
as we see the capital is trying to get
 
02:31:38.030 --> 02:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
its nose Under the Tent everywhere these
 
02:31:40.969 --> 02:31:40.979 align:start position:0%
two bills example of it
 
02:31:43.550 --> 02:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you additional discussion
 
02:31:46.309 --> 02:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
representative McGee
 
02:31:46.319 --> 02:31:48.110 align:start position:0%
representative McGee
um

02:31:48.110 --> 02:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:51.910 --> 02:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
my point would be that this is another
 
02:31:55.370 --> 02:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
effort to try and spur competition and
 
02:31:58.070 --> 02:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
fuel diversity and local sustainable
 
02:32:02.570 --> 02:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
energy so that we are not as beholden to
 
02:32:05.510 --> 02:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
the kinds of price spikes that we had
 
02:32:08.450 --> 02:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
um last year so there's we have a
 
02:32:10.010 --> 02:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion of how to view
 
02:32:14.210 --> 02:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
solving for that problem but I I think
 
02:32:17.389 --> 02:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
you know on on my in my caucus we're
 
02:32:19.849 --> 02:32:19.859 align:start position:0%
firmly of the opinion that if folks want
 
02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
to contribute to the market that we
 
02:32:24.230 --> 02:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
should enable it so that they have a
 
02:32:26.210 --> 02:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
cost structure that allows them to do so
 
02:32:28.370 --> 02:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
because it will be helpful to the state
 
02:32:30.050 --> 02:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and in the case of SB
 
02:32:33.370 --> 02:32:33.380 align:start position:0%
79 we heard from two of our largest
 
02:32:36.889 --> 02:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
long-term businesses and they were
 
02:32:39.469 --> 02:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
it was excellent testimony as was what
 
02:32:42.530 --> 02:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
was submitted to us in support of the
 
02:32:44.809 --> 02:32:44.819 align:start position:0%
fact that they are desperate for us to
 
02:32:47.690 --> 02:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
allow them to participate in creating
 
02:32:49.670 --> 02:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
that competitive market so there is
 
02:32:52.190 --> 02:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
another way to look at this which is not
 
02:32:56.630 --> 02:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
that we're preventing people from
 
02:32:59.330 --> 02:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
from being harmed by market competition
 
02:33:01.070 --> 02:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
but that we are enabling Market
 
02:33:03.349 --> 02:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
competition for the downward pressure
 
02:33:05.210 --> 02:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
that it puts on
 
02:33:07.670 --> 02:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
the cost of energy and that's that's how
 
02:33:09.969 --> 02:33:09.979 align:start position:0%
I view it
 
02:33:11.990 --> 02:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative munz
 
02:33:15.530 --> 02:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
um we we like to talk about New
 
02:33:19.610 --> 02:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire being a business friendly
 
02:33:19.620 --> 02:33:21.530 align:start position:0%
Hampshire being a business friendly
state

02:33:21.530 --> 02:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:33:21.540 --> 02:33:23.090 align:start position:0%
state
um and

02:33:23.090 --> 02:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:33:25.610 --> 02:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
um but but but one of the things when
 
02:33:27.889 --> 02:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
you when businesses are surveyed
 
02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and asked what are
 
02:33:33.530 --> 02:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
the things that determine whether they
 
02:33:37.330 --> 02:33:37.340 align:start position:0%
will expand here or remain here
 
02:33:40.429 --> 02:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
two of the most important items are
 
02:33:44.090 --> 02:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
Workforce and energy costs
 
02:33:48.130 --> 02:33:48.140 align:start position:0%
um one of the least important is taxes
 
02:33:54.010 --> 02:33:54.020 align:start position:0%
and yet we are very willing to
 
02:33:57.530 --> 02:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
give businesses tax reductions that they
 
02:33:58.969 --> 02:33:58.979 align:start position:0%
don't want
 
02:34:01.730 --> 02:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to giving them the the
 
02:34:06.010 --> 02:34:06.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address one of the
 
02:34:10.490 --> 02:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
biggest costs that they face by enabling
 
02:34:13.670 --> 02:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
them to do net metering if they want to
 
02:34:16.010 --> 02:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
and receive the benefits of net metering
 
02:34:19.370 --> 02:34:19.380 align:start position:0%
somehow we're unwilling to do that and
 
02:34:24.790 --> 02:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:28.010 --> 02:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
02:34:31.190 --> 02:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
again I must say that nothing in our
 
02:34:34.250 --> 02:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
current law prevents any business from
 
02:34:37.130 --> 02:34:37.140 align:start position:0%
building any solar system or wind system
 
02:34:40.490 --> 02:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
that they have the land and the proper
 
02:34:44.450 --> 02:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
zoning to address nothing at all if they
 
02:34:46.309 --> 02:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
want to do that to reduce their costs
 
02:34:51.230 --> 02:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:53.090 --> 02:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
to follow up on representative
 
02:34:56.030 --> 02:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
Bernardi's comment it would seem since
 
02:34:58.790 --> 02:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
companies are free to do this if they're
 
02:35:01.670 --> 02:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
not doing it because they're they want a
 
02:35:04.450 --> 02:35:04.460 align:start position:0%
subsidy that kind of proves the case
 
02:35:07.370 --> 02:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
that net metering is indeed a subsidy
 
02:35:08.690 --> 02:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
otherwise people would just go ahead and
 
02:35:10.730 --> 02:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
build solder and not worry about getting
 
02:35:13.849 --> 02:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
net metering subsidies
 
02:35:16.370 --> 02:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
isn't that the case representative
 
02:35:16.380 --> 02:35:17.809 align:start position:0%
isn't that the case representative
Bernardi

02:35:17.809 --> 02:35:17.819 align:start position:0%
Bernardi
 
02:35:21.010 --> 02:35:21.020 align:start position:0%
I concur with that assessment 100
 
02:35:23.630 --> 02:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
representative Corman
 
02:35:26.270 --> 02:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chair I just want to
 
02:35:28.610 --> 02:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
point out that we did have testimony uh
 
02:35:30.530 --> 02:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
from John Morrison of hitchner
 
02:35:33.170 --> 02:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and he gave us a letter
 
02:35:37.309 --> 02:35:37.319 align:start position:0%
that was supported by hitchner and eight
 
02:35:38.929 --> 02:35:38.939 align:start position:0%
other companies one of which was
 
02:35:41.929 --> 02:35:41.939 align:start position:0%
Stonyfield which also gave us their own
 
02:35:44.090 --> 02:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
letter so Stonyfield supports this
 
02:35:47.090 --> 02:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
Stonyfield organic and then also we had
 
02:35:50.210 --> 02:35:50.220 align:start position:0%
the business and industry Association in
 
02:35:54.830 --> 02:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:57.590 --> 02:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
so the question occurs then if it's good
 
02:35:59.690 --> 02:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
business to expand solar
 
02:36:02.210 --> 02:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
but not good business to expand solar
 
02:36:04.190 --> 02:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
unless you get a subsidy
 
02:36:06.710 --> 02:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
is that really good business
 
02:36:08.809 --> 02:36:08.819 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
02:36:12.230 --> 02:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so I can relate to
 
02:36:15.710 --> 02:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
this just recently in fact I was over a
 
02:36:17.330 --> 02:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
week and a half ago I went on the
 
02:36:19.370 --> 02:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
Tesla's website and I was looking
 
02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
actually looking at the really cool
 
02:36:22.730 --> 02:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
solar panels they had and this battery
 
02:36:25.130 --> 02:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
storage they have available put in your
 
02:36:25.140 --> 02:36:25.969 align:start position:0%
storage they have available put in your
house

02:36:25.969 --> 02:36:25.979 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:36:27.950 --> 02:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
and so I was looking at it and then they
 
02:36:29.389 --> 02:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
have a price structure on their website
 
02:36:31.610 --> 02:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
tells you how long you'd make your money
 
02:36:33.889 --> 02:36:33.899 align:start position:0%
back and for me it was about 10 years
 
02:36:35.990 --> 02:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'd be able to be positive of my
 
02:36:37.910 --> 02:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
electrical rate but in that whole time
 
02:36:39.950 --> 02:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
of me buying it and looking at it to
 
02:36:41.809 --> 02:36:41.819 align:start position:0%
purchase it from my house thinking I'd
 
02:36:44.210 --> 02:36:44.220 align:start position:0%
get my money back in 10 years not once
 
02:36:45.889 --> 02:36:45.899 align:start position:0%
did I expect the government to pay me
 
02:36:48.950 --> 02:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:50.990 --> 02:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
further comment further discussion
 
02:36:53.450 --> 02:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
02:36:55.990 --> 02:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh I would suggest the government made
 
02:36:59.690 --> 02:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
the uh legislation available so you
 
02:37:01.849 --> 02:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
could get a 10-year
 
02:37:04.670 --> 02:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
return on your investment the same way
 
02:37:06.110 --> 02:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
the government should be making it
 
02:37:08.690 --> 02:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
available for these companies to get a
 
02:37:10.130 --> 02:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
reasonable return on their investment
 
02:37:11.450 --> 02:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
for their solar
 
02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
and I would also add that when we're
 
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
already Subs I'm hearing the word
 
02:37:18.110 --> 02:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
subsidy a lot we're subsidizing the oil
 
02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
industry to the tune of 5.9 trillion
 
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
every year and every dollar we send out
 
02:37:25.309 --> 02:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
a state to subsidize oil
 
02:37:27.349 --> 02:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
means that we can't subsidize a
 
02:37:31.010 --> 02:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
home-grown uh resource such as
 
02:37:34.370 --> 02:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
solar when our businesses are asking for
 
02:37:36.710 --> 02:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
it and when our businesses are asking
 
02:37:38.690 --> 02:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
for it
 
02:37:40.670 --> 02:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
it seems the reasonable thing to do to
 
02:37:42.410 --> 02:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
support homegrown New Hampshire
 
02:37:44.389 --> 02:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
businesses the return it will be there
 
02:37:46.429 --> 02:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
the employees will they'll have more
 
02:37:48.590 --> 02:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
employees more people spending dollars
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
in the state it's just common sense I I
 
02:37:52.550 --> 02:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
don't see why there's even any debate on
 
02:37:52.560 --> 02:37:54.670 align:start position:0%
don't see why there's even any debate on
this

02:37:54.670 --> 02:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:37:57.770 --> 02:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
in 2022 according to the Energy
 
02:37:59.469 --> 02:37:59.479 align:start position:0%
Information assist
 
02:38:01.790 --> 02:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
Administration which was part of the U.S
 
02:38:04.070 --> 02:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
department of energy 85 percent of
 
02:38:06.950 --> 02:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
subsidies went to wind and solar
 
02:38:10.429 --> 02:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a comment
 
02:38:13.130 --> 02:38:13.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yes I am not aware
 
02:38:16.010 --> 02:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
of any subsidies that go to the oil and
 
02:38:19.490 --> 02:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
gas industry what what we have is an
 
02:38:21.469 --> 02:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
Administration that is essentially
 
02:38:24.410 --> 02:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
hostile to the development of oil and
 
02:38:26.270 --> 02:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
gas at this point in time not
 
02:38:27.950 --> 02:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
subsidizing it
 
02:38:31.010 --> 02:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
there are oil and gas depreciation
 
02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
allowances which are
 
02:38:35.650 --> 02:38:35.660 align:start position:0%
covered by the Energy
 
02:38:38.990 --> 02:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
Information Administration but those are
 
02:38:41.870 --> 02:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
depreciation basically of assets similar
 
02:38:43.849 --> 02:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
to what any other business does
 
02:38:46.309 --> 02:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas thank you
 
02:38:48.830 --> 02:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
just to add to that what I would say is
 
02:38:51.469 --> 02:38:51.479 align:start position:0%
that all those the all of what we just
 
02:38:53.210 --> 02:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
said about subsidies that's at the
 
02:38:55.730 --> 02:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
federal level the state does not give
 
02:38:58.490 --> 02:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
any subsidies to to the oil industry and
 
02:39:00.290 --> 02:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
that's a totally different animal we
 
02:39:04.370 --> 02:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:06.710 --> 02:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan
 
02:39:08.809 --> 02:39:08.819 align:start position:0%
I was uh just suggested thank you Mr
 
02:39:11.090 --> 02:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
chair I I would just suggest that the
 
02:39:13.849 --> 02:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
price structure that we set up for net
 
02:39:16.010 --> 02:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
metering can't be counted as a subsidy
 
02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's just the price structure that the
 
02:39:19.610 --> 02:39:19.620 align:start position:0%
market is set up and it's been enabled
 
02:39:22.790 --> 02:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
by the state and if if if that has
 
02:39:24.590 --> 02:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
determined to be faulty then we should
 
02:39:27.349 --> 02:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
reset the price structure but uh that
 
02:39:29.210 --> 02:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
you you can't call it a subsidy if the
 
02:39:33.969 --> 02:39:33.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:36.770 --> 02:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I agree with
 
02:39:38.270 --> 02:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
what your opening statement that we're
 
02:39:39.710 --> 02:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
not going to change anybody's mind here
 
02:39:41.690 --> 02:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
so can we just really we just wasting
 
02:39:43.790 --> 02:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
our time here uh can we move the
 
02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:45.770 align:start position:0%
our time here uh can we move the
question

02:39:45.770 --> 02:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:39:48.410 --> 02:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
okay I think uh there's a sentiment that
 
02:39:50.690 --> 02:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
we moved the question so
 
02:39:56.330 --> 02:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:58.309 --> 02:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
so I'd ask the clerk to call the role in
 
02:40:02.570 --> 02:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
the question of itl on Senate bill 79.

10 10. by a vote of 10 10 the motion of
 
02:40:49.070 --> 02:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
itl fails is there any appetite for a
 
02:40:52.969 --> 02:40:52.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:56.389 --> 02:40:56.399 align:start position:0%
well I'd like to make a motion of OTP
 
02:40:58.490 --> 02:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
get it on the record representative
 
02:41:01.790 --> 02:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
McGee moves OTP is there a second
 
02:41:03.889 --> 02:41:03.899 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams seconds the
 
02:41:05.929 --> 02:41:05.939 align:start position:0%
motion of OTP
 
02:41:09.230 --> 02:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:11.210 --> 02:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
representative McGee
 
02:41:13.490 --> 02:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
yes I'll just go back to the comments I
 
02:41:17.030 --> 02:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
had when we made the motion to stop
 
02:41:19.490 --> 02:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
um the point that I would make is that
 
02:41:22.070 --> 02:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
when we characterize things as subsidies
 
02:41:24.349 --> 02:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
saying any money that goes out is you
 
02:41:26.990 --> 02:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
know is is a subsidy
 
02:41:30.950 --> 02:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
um I would like to clarify that what we
 
02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:32.450 align:start position:0%
um I would like to clarify that what we
heard

02:41:32.450 --> 02:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
heard
 
02:41:36.290 --> 02:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
um Stonyfield uh Ann hitchner saying is
 
02:41:39.410 --> 02:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
that they've already invested uh in some
 
02:41:42.349 --> 02:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure locally in order to try
 
02:41:44.750 --> 02:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
and lower their bills but what they
 
02:41:48.469 --> 02:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
recognize is that the true value of the
 
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
energy that they're creating is not
 
02:41:52.130 --> 02:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
something that they're able to
 
02:41:54.469 --> 02:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
recompense with just their individual
 
02:41:57.770 --> 02:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
investment so if the actual value were
 
02:41:59.929 --> 02:41:59.939 align:start position:0%
being allowed to be submitted to people
 
02:42:01.849 --> 02:42:01.859 align:start position:0%
who invest in that infrastructure in the
 
02:42:03.710 --> 02:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
state then they would be making their
 
02:42:05.510 --> 02:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
money back quicker and they would they
 
02:42:08.450 --> 02:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
would be willing to invest more and so
 
02:42:10.250 --> 02:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
and that benefit would occur to
 
02:42:13.010 --> 02:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
everybody in the distribution area in
 
02:42:16.370 --> 02:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
which they reside unless they're only as
 
02:42:20.690 --> 02:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
this bill States oh only able to to net
 
02:42:23.090 --> 02:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
meter up to their own needs in the prior
 
02:42:26.150 --> 02:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
12 months so the bill has guard rails
 
02:42:29.990 --> 02:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
but I would reiterate that they came to
 
02:42:32.630 --> 02:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
us and told us what the problem is and
 
02:42:34.630 --> 02:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
for us to use
 
02:42:37.670 --> 02:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
vague ideas like it's a subsidy it's a
 
02:42:39.410 --> 02:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
this is that just to put a negative
 
02:42:41.150 --> 02:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
connotation on it we should be listening
 
02:42:43.429 --> 02:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
to the people that are
 
02:42:45.110 --> 02:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
um coming in here to give us information
 
02:42:49.550 --> 02:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:51.950 --> 02:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has a comment uh
 
02:42:54.290 --> 02:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
one thing that I believe is the case is
 
02:42:55.969 --> 02:42:55.979 align:start position:0%
that these companies are paying Peak
 
02:42:58.250 --> 02:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
billing basically they pay for the
 
02:43:01.070 --> 02:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of electricity so they
 
02:43:02.570 --> 02:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
have the choice of either stopping
 
02:43:05.410 --> 02:43:05.420 align:start position:0%
production when the sun's not shining or
 
02:43:07.849 --> 02:43:07.859 align:start position:0%
paying for electricity off the grid at
 
02:43:10.429 --> 02:43:10.439 align:start position:0%
the peak rate and so they're basically
 
02:43:11.690 --> 02:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
in the same situation where they're
 
02:43:13.910 --> 02:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
paying double even if they aren't using
 
02:43:18.050 --> 02:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:19.910 --> 02:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
I think we're pretty well talked out on
 
02:43:21.650 --> 02:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
this question so
 
02:43:23.750 --> 02:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
I would ask the clerk now to call the
 
02:43:25.370 --> 02:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
role on the question about to pass on
 
02:43:27.950 --> 02:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 79.
 
02:43:30.469 --> 02:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas no
 
02:43:33.650 --> 02:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
Janine nodder no Michael Harrington no
 
02:43:36.290 --> 02:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
Troy Marner no
 
02:43:39.889 --> 02:43:39.899 align:start position:0%
uh John lewicki no Lex barajny
 
02:43:43.730 --> 02:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
JD Bernardi no Tom plushie
 
02:43:45.410 --> 02:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
James Summers
 
02:43:47.270 --> 02:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
Kat McGee
 
02:43:51.469 --> 02:43:51.479 align:start position:0%
Rebecca McWilliams yes Jackie creation
 
02:43:55.250 --> 02:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
lucious partial yes Tony Kaplan
 
02:43:57.050 --> 02:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
Chris muns
 
02:44:01.370 --> 02:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
Henry Noel yes Wendy Thomas yes Thomas
 
02:44:06.530 --> 02:44:06.540 align:start position:0%

no
 
02:44:10.610 --> 02:44:10.620 align:start position:0%
and ten by a vote of 10 10 the motion
 
02:44:15.050 --> 02:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
about TP fails is there any appetite on
 
02:44:17.630 --> 02:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
the committee for a motion to retain
 
02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:19.190 align:start position:0%
the committee for a motion to retain
no

02:44:19.190 --> 02:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:44:21.730 --> 02:44:21.740 align:start position:0%
thank goodness
 
02:44:25.309 --> 02:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
with that we'll say that the
 
02:44:27.290 --> 02:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
recommendation on the floor will be
 
02:44:31.070 --> 02:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
without recommendation
 
02:44:34.730 --> 02:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
and representative uh Doug Thomas will
 
02:44:37.010 --> 02:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
write the
 
02:44:39.349 --> 02:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
case for the motion of itl who will
 
02:44:42.050 --> 02:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
write the case for the motion of
 
02:44:42.060 --> 02:44:45.670 align:start position:0%
write the case for the motion of
OTP

02:44:45.670 --> 02:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:49.670 --> 02:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds will write the
 
02:44:53.270 --> 02:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:56.110 --> 02:44:56.120 align:start position:0%

02:45:08.570 --> 02:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
so that concludes the exact session on
 
02:45:11.929 --> 02:45:11.939 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 79
 
02:45:15.410 --> 02:45:15.420 align:start position:0%

02:45:17.570 --> 02:45:17.580 align:start position:0%

02:45:23.389 --> 02:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
weather seems to be improving out there
