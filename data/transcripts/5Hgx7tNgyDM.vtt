00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
that's not a credit that's essentially
 
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
as an exemption from from tax from taxes
 
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:48.060 align:start position:0%

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
throughout this report uh there is going
 
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
to be mentioned or whether a credit is a
 
00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:17.339 align:start position:0%
cascading credit or a not cascading
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
credit and that explanation is provided
 
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
on page three of the report
 
00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:26.339 align:start position:0%
essentially a cascading credit as a
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
credit that is when taken against the
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax is also
 
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
deemed to be a taxes paid by the
 
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax and taken as a
 
00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:40.019 align:start position:0%
credit against the business profits tax
 
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
so for starting from
 
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
from a general perspective any taxes any
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise taxes that's paid by
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
a business organization can be taken as
 
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
a credit against their business profits
 
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.550 align:start position:0%
a credit against their business profits
taxes

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
so that's not a cascading credit that's
 
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
just how the uh the credits for business
 
00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
taxes work
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
for a uh in in page on page three you'll
 
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
see the examples of taxpayer a where
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
there are no uh and no other credits so
 
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer a has a business Enterprise
 
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
tax liability of 2500 and the BBT
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
liability of 7 500. so the BET taxes
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
that the taxpayer pays the 2500 is used
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
against the BPT and you see that 7 500
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
less 2500.
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
and so the total taxes that's being paid
 
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
by this taxpayer a is five thousand
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
dollars so that is the um the general
 
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
starting point of of tax credits
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
and then in taxpayer B situation where
 
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer gets a credit
 
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
and but that of 2 500 but that's not a
 
00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:53.339 align:start position:0%
cascading credit so that is applied
 
00:11:56.769 --> 00:11:56.779 align:start position:0%
against bet so you see here that bet
 
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:00.740 align:start position:0%
2500 original liability less than 2500
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
you have zero bet taxes and then for BPT
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
it's still 7 500 because there's no bet
 
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
taxes paid so in this situation the
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayer B uh owes seventy five hundred
 
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.250 align:start position:0%
taxpayer B uh owes seventy five hundred
dollars

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
an in taxpayer scenario where there is a
 
00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:21.899 align:start position:0%
cascading credit so that twenty five
 
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
first applied against the bet
 
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
and then cuts down the BET to zero
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
however that twenty five hundred dollars
 
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
can then also still be used against the
 
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.130 align:start position:0%
can then also still be used against the
BPT

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
BPT
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
and so 75 that's 2500 is 5 000 and
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
therefore the total tax to buy taxpayers
 
00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:43.139 align:start position:0%
is five thousand so that essentially
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
lays out the uh the the concept of a
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
cascading credit and that applies to
 
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519 align:start position:0%
some of the credits on this report are
 
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
cascading credits and some are not so
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
this just gives out the the base
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:02.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
so moving on to page four it just lists
 
00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:08.339 align:start position:0%
out uh what I mentioned earlier uh what
 
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
are the the credits that will be
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned on on this report
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
and page five provides a a brief
 
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
overview of the workings of the credits
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
here you'll see uh listing each of the
 
00:13:24.959 --> 00:13:26.030 align:start position:0%
here you'll see uh listing each of the
credits

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
credits
 
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
the statutes
 
00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
that is um
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
that applies to these credits and then
 
00:13:35.569 --> 00:13:35.579 align:start position:0%
the the taxes
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
that is applicable to these credits and
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
then the cap if is there is a cap on the
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
credits and and so on and so forth so
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
this is a very good um
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
reference point when you're reviewing
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
each each of the credits you can refer
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
back to this page and look back as to
 
00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:55.019 align:start position:0%
the the general overview of each of
 
00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
can I just ask a question
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
um the um so the current year cap on
 
00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
program that's total of all so if we
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
look at the first one cdfa new
 
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
investment the five million that's for
 
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:10.810 align:start position:0%
investment the five million that's for
all

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:10.820 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
taxpayers combined that's the that's
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
correct so so the cdfa I believe cdfa is
 
00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
um it's administered by the community
 
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
development financial Authority and so
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
they will issue a a credit out to those
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
um contributions that they received for
 
00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:32.459 align:start position:0%
that particular year up to five million
 
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:44.339 align:start position:0%
representative Ames has a question
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
with regard to cascading credits
 
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.730 align:start position:0%
with regard to cascading credits
um

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
see any rationale for
 
00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
the diff the difference of the picking
 
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
outs what do we have we got one two
 
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:02.990 align:start position:0%
outs what do we have we got one two
three

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
of these uh tax expenditure programs
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
uh to uh have the cascading credit and
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
another four
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
that do not have it is there can you
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
just discern anything other than maybe
 
00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:23.459 align:start position:0%
it just happened uh that way
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
um I I believe this is all uh it's
 
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
potentially a policy decision made by
 
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
legislature when they enacted these
 
00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.550 align:start position:0%
legislature when they enacted these
credits

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
credits
 
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
um so that I can't say much further than
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
then moving on to page six uh and this
 
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
is also another page with summary
 
00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.310 align:start position:0%
is also another page with summary
information

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh it lists out the amount of credits
 
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
that's used on each of the credits um
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's then provided in more detail in
 
00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:04.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
and I'll move on to page so uh so that's
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
the amount used as of the well as of
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
2022 so if I look at research and
 
00:16:14.769 --> 00:16:14.779 align:start position:0%
development tax credit
 
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
5.308 million that's only that much was
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
used out of 7 million uh yes that's the
 
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
amount of credit that uh that was
 
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:26.579 align:start position:0%
claimed on the returns that was that
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
were submitted in fiscalia 22. so the
 
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
these yes that's a good point uh
 
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
representative so these credits that's
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
utilized here are captured for the
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
returns that submitted in fiscal year
 
00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:39.889 align:start position:0%
returns that submitted in fiscal year
22.

00:16:39.889 --> 00:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
22.
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
um returns that submitted in fiscal year
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
22 could be
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
um you know could be late returns could
 
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
be returned as submitted on time so it
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
potentially could be 20 tax year 21
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
returns could be older returns but
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
whatever returns that we received by the
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
dra during the fiscal year 22 period
 
00:16:59.810 --> 00:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
thank you yep
 
00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.230 align:start position:0%
thank you yep
okay

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
so they do not correspond to the program
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
year caps so that's where you will see
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
that timing difference
 
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
so I guess that's my question so I'm
 
00:17:14.809 --> 00:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
looking at and using the r d tax credit
 
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
as a great example right we authorize up
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
to seven million dollars in tax credits
 
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
but we only got applied five million 5.3
 
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
million in tax credits were applied for
 
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
does that mean that all uh assuming the
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
uh the applying business
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
um asks for the maximum 50 I think it's
 
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars in the maximum
 
00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.110 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars in the maximum
right

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
um they because we're not at the cap
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
they would receive the full fifty
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar credit
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
so what happens is that uh as Lauren
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned is that there is a timing
 
00:17:48.049 --> 00:17:48.059 align:start position:0%
difference but when the
 
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
um when the credit is applied for by the
 
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
business organizations as and when the
 
00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
the business organizations file their
 
00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
return and claim the credit so
 
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
um the the Caps here as you mentioned is
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
the the credits that's awarded
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
whereas the amounts on page six is the
 
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
credits that's claimed on the return so
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
that with that timing difference you
 
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
could potentially see oh why some why
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
are some of these credits maybe the
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
amounts are higher than what the cap is
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's because well the taxpayers are
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
holding on to the credits some of the
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
credits can be carried over too when
 
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
they're not using in the year that they
 
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
claim it in in the following year and
 
00:18:33.049 --> 00:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
they claim the credit so all that well
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
that accumulates and they could
 
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
potentially raise the the amount of
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
credit that's claimed higher than the
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
cap that's provided so again if they if
 
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
they didn't have a tax liability they
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
can hold that credit for a following
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
year when they may have a tax liability
 
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
and you know how long that carry forward
 
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
is uh depending on the the program yeah
 
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
so then it in this case it's 5.3 million
 
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
but there are scenarios where people
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
held on to them you could go over 7
 
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.730 align:start position:0%
held on to them you could go over 7
million

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
yes and and also I'd like to add too
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's the cap
 
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.330 align:start position:0%
that's the cap
possible

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
with enough applications and some of
 
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
these the Caps aren't met and the other
 
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
ones we do meet the cap every year so
 
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
you also might see that too you may only
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
have two million on a five million
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
dollar cap that's actually awarded
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up so again so again my
 
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
understanding if I remember right from a
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
couple hearings is that these credits
 
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
though are prorated if we exceed the cap
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
right is that yes for the r d credit yes
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's how that means that at least for
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
this reporting cycle that the amount of
 
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:44.220 align:start position:0%
credit used
 
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
um it didn't exceed the cap and
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
therefore they got they were it was in
 
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:59.750 align:start position:0%
therefore they got they were it was in
prorated

00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
so um for r d credits that there is
 
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.970 align:start position:0%
so um for r d credits that there is
actually

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
um let me just double check here
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
there are a mixture of
 
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.789 align:start position:0%
there are a mixture of
um

00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
applications that exceeded the the fifty
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and there are
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
applications that's below the fifty
 
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and that combination
 
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.950 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and that combination
um

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
so but then the maximum amount of
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
credits that can be awarded is kept at
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
the seven million dollars
 
00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:31.700 align:start position:0%
um but then once again this 5.3 million
 
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
is when they claim it versus when
 
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
what's awarded right
 
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
again I'm just looking at the history of
 
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
that specific credit right it's 5
 
00:20:44.169 --> 00:20:44.179 align:start position:0%
million 5.3 5.6
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
5.3553 right we never got near the cap
 
00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
of seven and in theory assuming the the
 
00:20:51.179 --> 00:20:52.490 align:start position:0%
of seven and in theory assuming the the
business

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:54.059 align:start position:0%
asked for the maximum they would have
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
got the maximum because there was no cap
 
00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
on that we didn't hit the cap or
 
00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
um or if it was lower if they only
 
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
accounted for forty thousand dollars in
 
00:21:03.529 --> 00:21:03.539 align:start position:0%
the credit they only got a forty
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar credit because that's
 
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
what they applied for uh in total the
 
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
amount of um credits that's requested
 
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
for r d did exceed the 7 million and
 
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
now I'm confused because why would they
 
00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:21.539 align:start position:0%
be prorated yeah I'm trying to
 
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
understand we have the expenditures on
 
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
page nine of the r d tax credit not one
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
of them goes over seven million dollars
 
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
so why would we prorate it sorry the
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation is for the 50 million if
 
00:21:33.049 --> 00:21:33.059 align:start position:0%
you exceed to 50 million oh okay so
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying that they met they reached
 
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
the cap and therefore they might have
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
been eligible for a hundred thousand
 
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
dollars in r d credit but because we
 
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
have a program cap of 50 they only
 
00:21:42.289 --> 00:21:42.299 align:start position:0%
receive 50. so that's the proration but
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
not because the cap of the actual
 
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
it was the cap of the individual
 
00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:54.059 align:start position:0%
applicant was exceeded
 
00:21:54.059 --> 00:21:56.529 align:start position:0%
applicant was exceeded
the

00:21:56.529 --> 00:21:56.539 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
requested value
 
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
I would say yes yeah at this I think so
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
too but I just want to make sure I'm
 
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.730 align:start position:0%
too but I just want to make sure I'm
clear

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:06.299 align:start position:0%
because I'm assuming I'll have similar
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.890 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
wait so I understand individual
 
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
application may be prorated because
 
00:22:18.049 --> 00:22:18.059 align:start position:0%
they're asking for more than they're
 
00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
entitled to uh by law so therefore they
 
00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
ask for 65 because that's what they paid
 
00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:24.419 align:start position:0%
out for r d and that they're only
 
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
because of the cap is 50 we've prorated
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
it down to 50 and given them the max but
 
00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
what we didn't do is I was entitled to
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
50 but I exceeded the cap of the entire
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
program so therefore I'm only getting
 
00:22:39.409 --> 00:22:39.419 align:start position:0%
45. right so so we didn't do that we
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
only did it on the individual basis
 
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
based on the maximum per user cap thank
 
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:53.330 align:start position:0%
based on the maximum per user cap thank
you

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't mean to go off on them no
 
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.690 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't mean to go off on them no
let's

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
let's
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
go okay okay so
 
00:23:02.649 --> 00:23:02.659 align:start position:0%
um we'll go on to the uh purse credit
 
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
which is the community development
 
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
financial Authority uh all the new
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
investment tax credit
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
so this credit is administered by the
 
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.549 align:start position:0%
so this credit is administered by the
cdfa

00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
cdfa
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
um and it's
 
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
essentially uh we we can't talk too much
 
00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
about the administration of of the the
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
program because that's administered by
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
the cdfa
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
um and what we do know is that it is to
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
the this tax this credit it's a
 
00:23:36.049 --> 00:23:36.059 align:start position:0%
cascading credit
 
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
and it may be used against the BET
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
liability and then used against the BPT
 
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.049 align:start position:0%
liability and then used against the BPT
liability

00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:42.059 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
so the credit that's used um this amount
 
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
reported and used
 
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 22 were 20 211 taxpayers
 
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
and then the amount of credits that were
 
00:23:59.450 --> 00:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
claimed in fiscal year 22 was 4.2
 
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
and you can see from a trend from fiscal
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
year 2018 uh right to physically 22
 
00:24:09.289 --> 00:24:09.299 align:start position:0%
um there was a slight decline from
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2018 to 19 and then uh it
 
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
went back up to 20 50 to 20.
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
oh sorry it went back down fiscally 19
 
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
to 50 20 664 down to 144 but it went
 
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
back up in 21 because we get 21. and
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
continue to increase in fiscal year 22.
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
and this is an example of the timing
 
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
between the awarding of the credit and
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
when it's claimed so what you see here
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 22 number exceeds the
 
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
3.75 million but when we looked at how
 
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
it was awarded they were awarded
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
appropriately at that cap for those
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
years that they were eligible but it's
 
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
just the timing of when those returns
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.690 --> 00:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
okay so the in any one year you may
 
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
exceed the cap in terms of the the
 
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
absolute number but each year the amount
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.169 --> 00:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
yes and it's this cdfa that Awards the
 
00:25:15.179 --> 00:25:17.270 align:start position:0%
yes and it's this cdfa that Awards the
credit

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
credit
 
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
amount yep I'm sorry say that again it's
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
the cdfa that Awards the credit okay and
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
then then the taxpayer claims it on the
 
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
return and then we capture that
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
information okay Senator Lang so again I
 
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
just wanna sorry again I just want to be
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
clarifying this is that this has a 75
 
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
um the the credit is 75 of the uh actual
 
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:40.740 align:start position:0%
credit I don't know how else to say that
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
but it's kind of a weird statement but
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
we have five million authorized up too
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
but they only get 75 percent of that
 
00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
which is 3.75 million that could be
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
awarded in credit so people can donate
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
up to five million dollars to the
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
program but they're only going to get
 
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
3.5 3. whatever the numbers
 
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
um 75 million in possible credits but
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
and you can also see that uh from uh
 
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
this uh this credit that there's a
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
carryover provision for this credit so
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
before this there were questions about
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
you know which one is a has a credit
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
carryover and this one has a credit card
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
over up to five years
 
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.769 align:start position:0%
over up to five years
right

00:26:24.769 --> 00:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
any other questions on
 
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
on this one
 
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
saying none I guess we can go to the
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
right the the next credit is the
 
00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:39.059 align:start position:0%
economic revitalization zone tax credit
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
or the erz tax credit
 
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
um this credit uh currently is set to
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
repeal effective January of 2028
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
and this credit is also not administered
 
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
by the dra it's administered by the
 
00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:57.059 align:start position:0%
business economic business and economic
 
00:26:57.059 --> 00:26:59.090 align:start position:0%
business economic business and economic
affairs

00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
affairs
 
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
um and it is to encourage the payroll
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
and capital expenditure
 
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
um of of the companies in the um in
 
00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:12.299 align:start position:0%
those economic most designated economic
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh so the this erz tax credit shall be
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
applied against the business profits tax
 
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
first and any unused portion will be
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.409 --> 00:27:33.419 align:start position:0%
um and then any further unused portion
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
of this credit can be carried over for
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
five years
 
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:41.940 align:start position:0%
this is a cascading credit
 
00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:46.039 align:start position:0%
and in fiscal year 22 there were 41
 
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that received this that apply
 
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
and claim this credit for the total
 
00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
now it's just expiring in 2028 uh
 
00:28:06.649 --> 00:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
because it was tied to the um
 
00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
uh the jobs Act of uh uh I believe I
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
don't believe so
 
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure but it was uh it was
 
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
something in the
 
00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:21.539 align:start position:0%
in the uh laws of 2020 in initially
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
these this erz credit has an earlier
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
expiration but legislature has seen fit
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
to actually extend the
 
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
um the the repeal date year over year
 
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
and now it's set to expire Janu 1 2028
 
00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
all right moving on to uh the r d credit
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
so this one is administered by the dra
 
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.870 align:start position:0%
so this one is administered by the dra
um

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
this some history on this it was
 
00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:00.299 align:start position:0%
initially due to repeal in on July 1st
 
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
of 2015 but then that repeal date was
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
repealed um so it's not not going to be
 
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
there's no sunset on this r d credit and
 
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
uh and um on the first one there was no
 
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
end date either it's a cdfa oh yeah no
 
00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:21.950 align:start position:0%
end date either it's a cdfa oh yeah no
okay

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
um and so the this credit is uh
 
00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
calculated on the uh the wages the
 
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:31.740 align:start position:0%
qualifying Wages that's made by paid by
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
the the taxpayers and these wages are
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
um and as discussed earlier the each
 
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
taxpayer shall not exceed the fifty
 
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar limit on the claim on
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
the the ward of the r d credit
 
00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:54.539 align:start position:0%
um and then the cap is seven million
 
00:29:57.889 --> 00:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
dollars for the amount of um r d credit
 
00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
that is awarded each year
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 22 there were 235
 
00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that actually claimed this
 
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.269 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that actually claimed this
credit

00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
credit
 
00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:14.220 align:start position:0%
and out of that it amounts to 5.3
 
00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
million dollars of um
 
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions on r d i i just
 
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
one quick one clarifying again I just
 
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I'm clear so when
 
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the fiscal year 2022
 
00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
expenditure of 513 million
 
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
that's when the credit was applied to
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
their tax liability so it may have been
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
incurred in a prior year but it wasn't
 
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:40.860 align:start position:0%
actually used and these numbers are
 
00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:42.299 align:start position:0%
representing when that credit is used
 
00:30:45.649 --> 00:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
moving on page 10 that is the coast
 
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
County job creation credit uh then this
 
00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
credit is administered by the business
 
00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
and economic affairs
 
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
um and so this credit is targeted to
 
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
cause County
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
um it's to for foster the creation of
 
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:19.940 align:start position:0%
additional high quality jobs
 
00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:22.919 align:start position:0%
and the definition of high quality jobs
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh is Wages that is greater than 150 of
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
the current state minimum wage
 
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.090 align:start position:0%
the current state minimum wage
um

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:34.740 align:start position:0%
this credit shall first be applied
 
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
against the BET taxes and any remainder
 
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
should be applied against the BPT
 
00:31:43.789 --> 00:31:43.799 align:start position:0%
any unused credits can be carriable for
 
00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
five years and this is another one of
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
the examples of a cascading credit
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 22 there were 24
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that that claimed this credit
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
and for and then amounted to ninety six
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
any three uh that's it looks like a
 
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
significant drop do we have any idea of
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
what caused that
 
00:32:12.889 --> 00:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have a lot of details on
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
that because this is administered by the
 
00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
business and economic Affairs they
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
issued the award of the credits
 
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
um that agency potentially could see
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
maybe uh could maybe provide information
 
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
as maybe how many
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
um credits were awarded each fiscal year
 
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:31.740 align:start position:0%
but all we can say is that the amount of
 
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that claim the credit has has
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
decreased yeah
 
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.630 align:start position:0%
decreased yeah
okay

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions yeah
 
00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:48.289 --> 00:32:48.299 align:start position:0%
the next credit is the education tax
 
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
credit and this credit is a message by
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
um and this credit is based on the
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
amount of the donations that's made to
 
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
approve scholarship organizations
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
the tax credit is against the BPT bet
 
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
and interest in dividends tax up to 85
 
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
percent value of the donations made
 
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
and of course with the uh with the
 
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
repeal of the IND tax uh
 
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
the early repeal of the IND tax in Texas
 
00:33:25.009 --> 00:33:25.019 align:start position:0%
24 onwards so
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
um you will see that the application of
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
the credits will
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
will not impact the uh I mean probably
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
more if the individuals
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
who worked claiming this credit will not
 
00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
be able to claim his credit anymore
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
um and if there were business
 
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
organizations that were claiming IND
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
taxes they will not be claiming the
 
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
credit against their IND taxes
 
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
potentially then moving it to the bptm
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:53.159 --> 00:33:54.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:57.289 --> 00:33:57.299 align:start position:0%
this credit program is credit award is
 
00:34:00.529 --> 00:34:00.539 align:start position:0%
kept at 5.1 million dollars
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
this credit
 
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
issue maybe cared for it for five years
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
um and then the amount of the number of
 
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that claim this Credit in
 
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 was 120
 
00:34:24.649 --> 00:34:24.659 align:start position:0%
for a total amount of 1.5 million
 
00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:28.190 align:start position:0%
for a total amount of 1.5 million
dollars

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:30.839 align:start position:0%
and you see that trend of increasing
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
from fiscal year 18 through fiscal year
 
00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.669 align:start position:0%
from fiscal year 18 through fiscal year
22

00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
22
 
00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:35.510 align:start position:0%
22
um

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:38.220 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the number of taxpayers
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
claimings great
 
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
it's interesting we're nowhere near the
 
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
cap but with the number of taxpayers
 
00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.149 align:start position:0%
cap but with the number of taxpayers
increasing

00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
maybe uh it'll get there at some point
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative Ames yeah
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
um is looking at the report files last
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
year I guess
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
2022 by Patrick abrami for this
 
00:35:03.839 --> 00:35:05.690 align:start position:0%
2022 by Patrick abrami for this
committee

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:06.710 align:start position:0%
committee
um

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
said about this tax credit that it he
 
00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:14.060 align:start position:0%
noted that the tax credits amounted to
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
1.909 million which is the number we
 
00:35:20.089 --> 00:35:20.099 align:start position:0%
have here for fiscal year 21.
 
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
that there would be more growth than
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
there has been so I know I you really
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
aren't on top of the details of what's
 
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
happening with these education tax
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
credits I imagine because the Department
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
of Education managed process but I may
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
be wrong about that
 
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
and I just curious about what is
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
happening the actual use
 
00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
well the amount charged
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
was 1.9 last year and 1.545 this year
 
00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.710 align:start position:0%
was 1.9 last year and 1.545 this year
um

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
so what's happening this is the question
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
once again this could be oh so
 
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.069 align:start position:0%
once again this could be oh so
um

00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
a question of when the credits were
 
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
awarded versus when the credits were
 
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
claimed under return
 
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.730 align:start position:0%
claimed under return
um

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
yes we do see a drop from 1.9 to a 1.5
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
um and I think that is
 
00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
the the amount of credits that were
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
awarded could potentially have
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
been higher than that but then the
 
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
amount that's claimed in fiscal 22 is
 
00:36:47.329 --> 00:36:47.339 align:start position:0%
showing that 1.5 million dollars
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
well you know what you know that what
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
I'm I mean this is just my guess but if
 
00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
I look at fiscal year 19 to fiscal year
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
20 you went from 74 to 110 a huge
 
00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
increase and my guess is not all those
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
were taken right away they got the
 
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
credits they didn't use them right away
 
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
and then it gets reflected in that huge
 
00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
number in 21 of 1.9 million and then you
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
see the numbers moderating to a huge
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
degree now it's just six more and then
 
00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
four more and thus the drop kind of
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
makes sense because now a lot of those
 
00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
pent-up credits have been used
 
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
just a guess based on looking at these
 
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.650 align:start position:0%
just a guess based on looking at these
numbers

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:23.660 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
I think it would be if we can manage it
 
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
at some point it would be uh worth
 
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
having it in the
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
the two funds that actually
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
administered and make the
 
00:37:41.329 --> 00:37:41.339 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
the awards to uh for scholarships
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
because last year when we had
 
00:37:50.569 --> 00:37:50.579 align:start position:0%
a ground floor
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
days that the scholarship fund indicated
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
that 698 scholarships in 2010 to 21 was
 
00:38:01.089 --> 00:38:01.099 align:start position:0%
granted averaging
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
2832 first dollars so if the obvious
 
00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
question is what what's what's happened
 
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
since then yeah I mean it's not a bad
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
idea and one of the things we'll discuss
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
after this
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
is in in Patrick abrami's report he
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned that they they analyzed three
 
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
of the seven funds and this that was one
 
00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
of them so there's four that weren't
 
00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099 align:start position:0%
looked at so we may have to look at how
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
much time do we have and maybe we should
 
00:38:29.329 --> 00:38:29.339 align:start position:0%
look at those four instead of looking at
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
this again although I I do find Meriden
 
00:38:34.609 --> 00:38:34.619 align:start position:0%
in your um comment there
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang so again I just don't want
 
00:38:38.089 --> 00:38:38.099 align:start position:0%
to make sure we don't confuse the 1.5
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
million is not amount not the amount
 
00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
that was awarded in scholarships right
 
00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
that is strictly the amount of credits
 
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
that were applied to an individual's
 
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
returns so those things are not it's
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
equal right um so there may be in the
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
fund more money than was you know that
 
00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
and we can talk to you know Kate Baker
 
00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
and he had Department of Education on
 
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
what that on the purpose of the usage of
 
00:38:59.569 --> 00:38:59.579 align:start position:0%
that fund but it looked like Pat did
 
00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
that last year
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
um but I just want to make sure
 
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
everyone's clear 1.5 is it the amount
 
00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
that that was issued in scholarships it
 
00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:08.099 align:start position:0%
was strictly the amount of tax credit
 
00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:10.619 align:start position:0%
issued to businesses or individuals that
 
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
were applying either IND tax BBT tax or
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
bet tax and donated to that organization
 
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
and therefore was ineligible for an 85
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
return on a tax credit so and that's
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
what that represents is the 85 percent
 
00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
of the tax credit that was issued and
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
also I would like to add you had
 
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
mentioned the 698 credit scholarships
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
awarded at the average twenty eight
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars so that was in 2021 and
 
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:39.260 align:start position:0%
2122 I have that in front of me it was
 
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
1171 scholarships were awarded so nearly
 
00:39:45.849 --> 00:39:45.859 align:start position:0%
double and that was at two point uh 2
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
943 was the average scholar Fellowship
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
so the um the average allowable
 
00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:52.740 align:start position:0%
scholarship goes up every year and
 
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
that's based on an inflation adjustment
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
adjustment so then for 22.23 it's now
 
00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:03.980 align:start position:0%
2995 for the average and
 
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
1443 scholarships were awarded
 
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
so that is growing there are more
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
scholarships being awarded
 
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry what was the last year or I
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
guess sure so the scholarships awarded
 
00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
this is 22.23
 
00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:26.099 align:start position:0%
and that is 1443.
 
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
and the average allowable scholarship is
 
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
2995. the one before that you said
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
Eleven Hundred and seventy one
 
00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
scholarships and what was the average
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
award two thousand nine hundred forty
 
00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.250 align:start position:0%
award two thousand nine hundred forty
three

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
and the the next um
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
tax expenditure is the exemption for
 
00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
qualified regenerative manufacturing
 
00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:05.329 align:start position:0%
qualified regenerative manufacturing
companies

00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:05.339 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
uh this is administered by the dra once
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
again this is not a credit essentially
 
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
it is an exemption uh from uh tax from
 
00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
business profits and business Enterprise
 
00:41:20.589 --> 00:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
tax these uh entities that qualify as a
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
qualified regenerative manufacturing
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
company they submitted an application to
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
the dra saying that they are these kinds
 
00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
of companies and then there are treat it
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
as not business organizations and they
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
would need to annually file
 
00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.829 align:start position:0%
would need to annually file
informational

00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
informational
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
documents to us to maintain that status
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
because the number of
 
00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:47.390 align:start position:0%
because the number of
um

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
qualifying companies is less than the
 
00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
disclosure threshold we're not able to
 
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
and this is uh this this exemption
 
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
expires for taxable peers beginning
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
maybe I missed the beginning of your
 
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:16.140 align:start position:0%
description why you don't have a chart
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
on this one like you did with the other
 
00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
ones because the amount of
 
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
qrmc qualified regenerative
 
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
manufacturing companies is less than the
 
00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:29.339 align:start position:0%
threshold disclosure that disclosures
 
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
threshold that we're allowed to provide
 
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
so we cannot provide the uh we're we're
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
bound to not provide the the any
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
statistical information on this what is
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
that disclosure threshold uh for
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
Statewide is 10 taxpayers oh 10 10
 
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.970 align:start position:0%
Statewide is 10 taxpayers oh 10 10
records

00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
10 records
 
00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
less than 10 businesses have applied for
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
this tax credit so therefore we can't
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
disclose could be easy to determine
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
which end might be that's correct
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
position oh I see okay less than 10 have
 
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
claimed claimed it or filed something
 
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
and that's the informational filing
 
00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:09.650 align:start position:0%
and that's the informational filing
okay

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
yeah my apologies Mr chairs we spoke
 
00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:14.180 align:start position:0%
before I have a previous
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
no problem thanks for thanks for coming
 
00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:21.190 align:start position:0%
no problem thanks for thanks for coming
by

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
this was my first term in the house this
 
00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
bill this bill was passed and so again
 
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
the reasoning for this tax credit the
 
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
background behind this tax credit was we
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
basically wanted to create the Silicon
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
Valley of the East
 
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
um for regenerative medicine was the
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
idea right
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
um and we've got like less than 10
 
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
businesses but some businesses coming in
 
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
and doing it we also recognize the fact
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
that by its nature startups aren't
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
profitable you know most startups are
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
not profitable so the impact is going to
 
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
be minimal to begin with because they
 
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be paying BBT and they would be
 
00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:56.099 align:start position:0%
able to be paying bet potentially but
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
again we wanted to encourage them to
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
come in so we're basically giving them a
 
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
waiver on BET in order to create a a
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
core Focus for New Hampshire I think
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
it's been semi-effective we've had some
 
00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:09.980 align:start position:0%
good progress come out of that Army AR
 
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
armi the advanced regenerative medicine
 
00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.030 align:start position:0%
armi the advanced regenerative medicine
initiative

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
00:44:17.089 --> 00:44:17.099 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire so uh just for a
 
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
little background for members yeah thank
 
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
you so and this also implies that no
 
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
credits have been taken at this point
 
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
it's not a credit it's an exemption from
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
business taxes it's an exemption okay
 
00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
and is there a limit on
 
00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
those exemptions there's there's no
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
limit no
 
00:44:38.569 --> 00:44:38.579 align:start position:0%
okay 10-year a 10-year pass yeah
 
00:44:38.579 --> 00:44:39.650 align:start position:0%
okay 10-year a 10-year pass yeah
okay

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess what I'm struggling with
 
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
I don't have a full understanding of it
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
is how do we know what the impact is
 
00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:48.980 align:start position:0%
to State revenues
 
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
or we don't I
 
00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:55.220 align:start position:0%
Senator I was a co-sponsor of the bill
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
that that created this exemption and I
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
think it's it's an unknown at this point
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
in time
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:45:07.569 --> 00:45:07.579 align:start position:0%
the company that this was uh
 
00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:11.339 align:start position:0%
developed for has ex has expanded it it
 
00:45:14.089 --> 00:45:14.099 align:start position:0%
Manchester it has grown the rest of the
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
number of employees
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
Etc I don't know what that is but there
 
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
there has been growth in that area in
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
another company in the regenerative
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
business has relocated the Baychester
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
also so I know I know of two companies
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
that would qualify for this at this at
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
this point point type both located in in
 
00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester but
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have any idea of of
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
really what's what's happening in terms
 
00:45:43.609 --> 00:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
of activity there and financial activity
 
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
the only thing we do know is that uh DOD
 
00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:50.220 align:start position:0%
has given two grants
 
00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
for uh for this entity to get going one
 
00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
was from about 80 billion in the second
 
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
was for another 20 million so there's
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
100 million of investment or the part of
 
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
DOD in this in this operation okay
 
00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:07.619 align:start position:0%
so the um it sounds like the good news
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
is there's some activity happening and
 
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
the hope would be that eventually these
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
companies grow to the point where they
 
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
are paying business profits and vet well
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
again as of December 31st 2027 I'll be
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
paying bet at that point again this was
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
basically a startup provisional allow
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
businesses to get a foothold and get
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
anchored in understanding that in 10
 
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
years that critical the exemption goes
 
00:46:39.069 --> 00:46:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
the next credit is the Career and
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
Technical Education Center Credit on
 
00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:47.540 align:start position:0%
this system ID Department of Education
 
00:46:50.329 --> 00:46:50.339 align:start position:0%
uh so the purpose is to encourage
 
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
charitable donations to Regional Career
 
00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
and Technical education centers
 
00:46:58.730 --> 00:46:58.740 align:start position:0%
um the maximum amount of credits issued
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
to all donors will is kept at fifty five
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars and this
 
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
program is scheduled to be repealed
 
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:10.140 align:start position:0%
after fiscal year 2026. once again this
 
00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:12.839 align:start position:0%
was another example of uh where the
 
00:47:16.609 --> 00:47:16.619 align:start position:0%
information the number of Records is
 
00:47:16.619 --> 00:47:17.210 align:start position:0%
information the number of Records is
um

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:17.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
it's below the
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
the reporting thresh the disclosure
 
00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
threshold then we can provide any
 
00:47:25.069 --> 00:47:25.079 align:start position:0%
information on
 
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
it is a it is not a cascading credit
 
00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:36.589 align:start position:0%
it is a it is not a cascading credit
though

00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
representative Ames we should at least
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
note that this is a program that's
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
scheduled to be repealed after fiscal
 
00:47:58.130 --> 00:47:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
so this part of the report is additional
 
00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:07.370 align:start position:0%
so this part of the report is additional
information

00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
um and this is on the first item here is
 
00:48:13.609 --> 00:48:13.619 align:start position:0%
net operating losses and this is only
 
00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
applicable to the reduction in business
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
profits taxes there have been a few
 
00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
developments in the area of net
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
operating losses uh recently in the
 
00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
legislature one being that the net
 
00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
operating losses will only be apportion
 
00:48:31.849 --> 00:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
once as opposed to previously it was
 
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
twice a portion in the year that the
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
losses would incurred and then the year
 
00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
the losses was was applied so that has
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
changed currently the um and then also
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
the calculation of net operating loss is
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
now tied to the uh internal Internal
 
00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:50.300 align:start position:0%
Revenue code of 2018
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
previously it was tied to the Internal
 
00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
Revenue code of 96.
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
um and this the the carryovers oh sorry
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
the nols that's generated a new actually
 
00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
has a cap on the the nols it caps it at
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars per entity
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
I and it's only available for any carry
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
forwards of unused nols to up to 10
 
00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:17.630 align:start position:0%
forwards of unused nols to up to 10
years

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
um in fiscal year 22 there were 6995
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
business organizations that were that
 
00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
claimed the nol deduction
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
um in total nols use after apportionment
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
is 470 million dollars
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
and then the average annual use so we
 
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
take the 470 million divide by 6995
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of business organizations come
 
00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:44.339 align:start position:0%
up with an average NL per uh business
 
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
organization of 67 000 to 37.
 
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
and the total tax decrease due to nol is
 
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:01.140 align:start position:0%
and you see year over year in terms of
 
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
the trend there is an increase in the
 
00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
um I guess I have a general question if
 
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
you know the answer to this I mean this
 
00:50:20.329 --> 00:50:20.339 align:start position:0%
is so now this is report of additional
 
00:50:20.339 --> 00:50:21.470 align:start position:0%
is so now this is report of additional
information

00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
does is this committee is reviewing the
 
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
tax expenditure is this considered
 
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
one of those yes okay so so there's more
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
than seven then this there's
 
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
every state
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
or maybe more this champion
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
so one thing I will find interesting is
 
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
that we were talking earlier about like
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
even on the Community Development
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority right they were there
 
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
the actual taking of the credit was
 
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
pretty low up until we hit 22. and then
 
00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
we saw a big taking you know an increase
 
00:50:55.849 --> 00:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
over a million 1.2 million dollars an
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
increase in cdfa from three million
 
00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
dollars by 4.2 million dollars where
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
businesses are actually or individuals
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
are taking that credit
 
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
um and we're seeing the same thing here
 
00:51:08.089 --> 00:51:08.099 align:start position:0%
I think in this so that we see 22 as an
 
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
outlier where a significant number of
 
00:51:11.569 --> 00:51:11.579 align:start position:0%
businesses are taking credits that are
 
00:51:14.089 --> 00:51:14.099 align:start position:0%
hanging at that are that are available
 
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
um so just as a comment and more than
 
00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
anything else is that we're seeing more
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
businesses use up those tax credits
 
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
which for this year reduces the amount
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
of Revenue but it also reduces the
 
00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
liability so we're not having those
 
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
credits hang out there either so it's a
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
it's a protocon in there that the
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
liability of the state's reduced because
 
00:51:33.049 --> 00:51:33.059 align:start position:0%
we don't have we don't have those
 
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:41.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.609 --> 00:51:43.619 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next page is Page 15
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
there's a business Enterprise tags
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
um and so uh this business Enterprise
 
00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
any taxes any business Enterprise tax is
 
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
paid will be considered as a credit can
 
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:55.740 align:start position:0%
be taken as a credit against business
 
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
profits tax so
 
00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:58.490 align:start position:0%
profits tax so
um

00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:02.809 --> 00:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
and they're in fiscal year 22 there were
 
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
38 000 returns
 
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
um that file had had a bad liability and
 
00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:10.380 align:start position:0%
total let that Library report it was
 
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
2019 million dollars
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
um in the BET used against BPT is 183
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
so again on a this is a one-to-one ratio
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
so if I have a thousand dollars in BPT
 
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
yes but I paid 100 in in bet I can take
 
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
that hundred dollars take it off the BPT
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
liability exactly and I only have a 900
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
in total you'll still be
 
00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:40.910 align:start position:0%
in total you'll still be
um

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
you'll still be that one thousand
 
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
dollars because it offsets
 
00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
um and also note that not all taxpayers
 
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh will have both bet and bet you know
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
some textures might have a higher bet
 
00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:58.140 align:start position:0%
than BBT uh essentially maybe those will
 
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:00.839 align:start position:0%
be taxpayers with more payroll heavy
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
oriented businesses
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
um like those
 
00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:07.460 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
consultancy services with heavy payroll
 
00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:13.250 align:start position:0%
consultancy services with heavy payroll
yeah

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
so again you actually struck me with a
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
question though a person pays more BBT
 
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
than they oh they don't get a credit
 
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
they get a credit to follow that forward
 
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:24.059 align:start position:0%
so again if say I paid a thousand
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
dollars in B E.T but I only have 100
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
liability I just get the net zero out my
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
zero out my PPT I don't get it 900 bucks
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
back from the state no that's not a
 
00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
but it can be carried forward 10 years
 
00:53:41.809 --> 00:53:41.819 align:start position:0%
yes so that 900 difference can be
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
carried forward to another year and used
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:52.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:55.740 align:start position:0%
entities are exempt from the bet the
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
basic statute
 
00:54:00.049 --> 00:54:00.059 align:start position:0%
who doesn't pay the bet
 
00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
oh the there's a threshold amount of I
 
00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
believe right now is 203
 
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
000 or something like that for uh enter
 
00:54:11.329 --> 00:54:11.339 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise Value
 
00:54:14.809 --> 00:54:14.819 align:start position:0%
so if the uh the business organization's
 
00:54:16.849 --> 00:54:16.859 align:start position:0%
Enterprise Value is less than that then
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
they won't need to be submitting a bad
 
00:54:19.079 --> 00:54:19.970 align:start position:0%
they won't need to be submitting a bad
return

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
return
 
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
other than that um if they have any
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
business organization or business
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
Enterprise that has more than that
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
threshold will be required to um to
 
00:54:31.849 --> 00:54:31.859 align:start position:0%
submit a bad return unless they qualify
 
00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
as a qrmc
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
then they will be Exempted I believe the
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
statute certain entities are exempt from
 
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
the bet
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
and I believe even
 
00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:41.990 align:start position:0%
and I believe even
um

00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
I believe even the uh
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
5013c organizations probably I believe
 
00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
they are also they're not exempt I
 
00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:52.980 align:start position:0%
believe they do have to
 
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:55.140 align:start position:0%
um file a bad return if they meet the
 
00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:59.089 align:start position:0%
um file a bad return if they meet the
threshold

00:54:59.089 --> 00:54:59.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:02.170 --> 00:55:02.180 align:start position:0%
but I need to double check them just
 
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
just remember the implementation of the
 
00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
statute okay thank you thank you thank
 
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:11.390 align:start position:0%
statute okay thank you thank you thank
you

00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so again I think you're so
 
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:16.740 align:start position:0%
your question was Senator was our 50c3
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
type organizations exempt from BET and
 
00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
the answer is we're not sure right now
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
yeah I believe they are not exempt
 
00:55:25.849 --> 00:55:25.859 align:start position:0%
um I believe so but I just need to
 
00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:29.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:31.740 align:start position:0%
okay looking at the statute
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
I think anyway I'll re-look at it just
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
all right obviously if we can get yeah
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
and moving on to page 16 this is the uh
 
00:56:13.849 --> 00:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
credit carryovers of from overpaid
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
business taxes this is the uh the the
 
00:56:19.609 --> 00:56:19.619 align:start position:0%
big issue with the ccos
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
um and once again the the latest
 
00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:23.819 align:start position:0%
development in in this uh credit carrier
 
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
over issue is that for taxable peers and
 
00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
the owner will be after December 3122
 
00:56:33.049 --> 00:56:33.059 align:start position:0%
their credits that's allowed to be
 
00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
carried over is up to 500 percent of the
 
00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:38.940 align:start position:0%
total tax liability uh for the taxable
 
00:56:41.809 --> 00:56:41.819 align:start position:0%
period and then the remainders shall be
 
00:56:45.549 --> 00:56:45.559 align:start position:0%
refunded and that cap will be
 
00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
reduced in to 250 percent of the taxable
 
00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
periods ending on or after December 31
 
00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:56.339 align:start position:0%
2025 and then up to 100 only uh for
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
taxable peers and the owner after
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
December 31 2027.
 
00:57:01.079 --> 00:57:03.190 align:start position:0%
December 31 2027.
foreign

00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
so you see here in the um
 
00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
well fiscally 22 and you can see that
 
00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
the trend from specifically 21 to fiscal
 
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
22 the the number of uh credit carriers
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
has dropped from 20 000 to 17 000 uh but
 
00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
then you'll see the fiscal year 21
 
00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:24.780 align:start position:0%
through 22 the amount of uh credit card
 
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
over is actually increased from 297 to
 
00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:30.349 align:start position:0%
over is actually increased from 297 to
342

00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
342
 
00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.059 align:start position:0%
um so I guess then the question is uh
 
00:57:35.089 --> 00:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
are we seeing the are we not seeing the
 
00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
impact of this 500 cap
 
00:57:40.609 --> 00:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
um but bear in mind this is information
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 22. so for fiscal year
 
00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:47.240 align:start position:0%
22 mainly uh for calendar year filers
 
00:57:52.849 --> 00:57:52.859 align:start position:0%
this likely would be for um texture 2020
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
calendar year filers because
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
um tax year 2020 the returns are due
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
April 15 of 21 and most of the filers
 
00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:03.980 align:start position:0%
actually file
 
00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
on extension and then they returns it up
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
will see the returns in November of 21
 
00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
and that falls into fiscal year 22. so
 
00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
for tax year 22 this cap has not does
 
00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
not apply to those taxpayers yet because
 
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
it only applies to the uh for taxable
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
appears ending on or after December 31
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
22 to 500 so likely you'll see uh as
 
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:28.140 align:start position:0%
Laura mentioned earlier during the
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
conversation is that we are starting to
 
00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
see some impact on this 500 cap and in
 
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
the current
 
00:58:38.809 --> 00:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
um current period yes so we started so
 
00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
we started seeing
 
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
um very small impacts on the small and
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
medium-sized businesses because they hit
 
00:58:47.809 --> 00:58:47.819 align:start position:0%
that 500 very quickly on their liability
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
and we started seeing that a little bit
 
00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
in April and and a little bit every
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
month and this is the first month where
 
00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's starting to ramp up a little bit
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
where we see the number of refunds are
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
due to hitting that
 
00:59:02.809 --> 00:59:02.819 align:start position:0%
um 500 percent cap but we're still
 
00:59:05.329 --> 00:59:05.339 align:start position:0%
probably not going to see it on the very
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
large organizations and the large fiscal
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
filers either later this year or even
 
00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
next year or when we get to the 250.
 
00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:15.349 align:start position:0%
next year or when we get to the 250.
okay

00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
so I mean extraordinarily High to hit
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
500 when you're very large right so
 
00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
taxpayers themselves may or may not know
 
00:59:24.109 --> 00:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
law but you the dra is saying okay
 
00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
you've hit 500 and you're sending money
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
back correct our system is set up to
 
00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
identify those and and then to issue
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
those refunds and also one thing we have
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
noticed is that some taxpayers are
 
00:59:42.049 --> 00:59:42.059 align:start position:0%
electing to just keep a hundred percent
 
00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
of their liability on the books and not
 
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
take the full 500 that they still could
 
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
have for even next tax year because the
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
250 doesn't begin until tax year 25.
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
but they are opting for the 100 now
 
00:59:57.410 --> 00:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang
 
00:59:59.690 --> 00:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
so do we have a list of liability like
 
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
what is our outstanding liability for
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
for these credit carrier carryovers
 
01:00:06.589 --> 01:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
what's the gross number we're looking at
 
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
hanging out there and how many how many
 
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
taxpayers hit the 500 threshold or will
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
hit the Five Mile threshold
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
and what what is the amount we expect to
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
be refunded
 
01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
we don't have that ready quite yet we
 
01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:21.170 align:start position:0%
we don't have that ready quite yet we
know

01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
um what is outstanding I don't have that
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
information in front of me right now
 
01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
that what that is part of the fiscal
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
year closing process so we did provide
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
that to admin Services I just do not
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
have the number and the count in front
 
01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
of me and
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
um we're only really evaluating refunds
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
that are 10 000 or greater or you
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
requested a credit in tax year 22.
 
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
so we haven't evaluated every single
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
refund that went out the door
 
01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:49.799 align:start position:0%
well Mr chair I guess I'd ask for that
 
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
because hey that's going to impact
 
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
revenues and I'd kind of like to have an
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
idea what that looks like if we know
 
01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:56.510 align:start position:0%
idea what that looks like if we know
that

01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
um that uh and you know the 22 numbers
 
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
the 500 percent how much anybody who's
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
above 500 how much money are refunding
 
01:01:04.609 --> 01:01:04.619 align:start position:0%
back because that's money that's not
 
01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:05.940 align:start position:0%
going basically coming out of the
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
general fund regardless of Revenue is
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
coming in so I'd like to see what that
 
01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:11.220 align:start position:0%
net difference is looking like
 
01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
and then the same if we can what we
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
project out for 25 that reduction of 250
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
here's our estimated liability and we'll
 
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
be writing checks for this much money in
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
on January 1. you know to to taxpayers
 
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
and what that number looks like so we
 
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
have an estimate of what that those
 
01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
revenue or those yeah those spending
 
01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
those expenditures are going to look
 
01:01:32.099 --> 01:01:33.410 align:start position:0%
those expenditures are going to look
like

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
that would be good that would be good
 
01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:36.829 align:start position:0%
that would be good that would be good
again

01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ames
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
just trying to make sure I've got this
 
01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:43.250 align:start position:0%
just trying to make sure I've got this
um

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:45.849 --> 01:01:45.859 align:start position:0%
so before this change
 
01:01:45.859 --> 01:01:47.390 align:start position:0%
so before this change
taxpayer

01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:52.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
could choose either to leave it with the
 
01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
department or not and I was left with
 
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
with the state
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
part of the revenue reported by the
 
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
agency is that right
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:02:13.849 --> 01:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
what used to be
 
01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
revenue and hang in there until maybe
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
there was a subsequent
 
01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
change of mind by the taxpayer
 
01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:25.150 align:start position:0%
change of mind by the taxpayer
um

01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh what's changed is that now there's a
 
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.730 align:start position:0%
uh what's changed is that now there's a
mandatory

01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:32.630 align:start position:0%
mandatory
um

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
Credit in effect uh return of money to
 
01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:37.940 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
which means that
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
well we counted as Revenue before under
 
01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
our different different system will no
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
longer be Revenue
 
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
in this new system do I have this more
 
01:02:52.609 --> 01:02:52.619 align:start position:0%
or less right
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
um so I mean it's essentially what
 
01:02:57.490 --> 01:02:57.500 align:start position:0%
happens is with with the the 500
 
01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
limitation anything in excess of the 500
 
01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
will be refunded to the taxpayer so that
 
01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
refund goes against the revenue reducing
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
the revenue number in the future here
 
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
though but the but the revenue came in
 
01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
in the previous year so we're we
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
accounted for it there but we're taking
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
it off now it has a refund right right
 
01:03:16.849 --> 01:03:16.859 align:start position:0%
that's why it's important to understand
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
what that number looks like sure
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
remember budgeting purposes
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
we are proactively
 
01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
um sending out letters to taxpayers that
 
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:28.140 align:start position:0%
have credit and asking them to make a
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
decision if they want instead of just
 
01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
assuming leave the credit on account we
 
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
ask please respond back if you want to
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
leave a credit on account or then a
 
01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:38.579 align:start position:0%
refund will be issued if there is no
 
01:03:38.579 --> 01:03:40.849 align:start position:0%
refund will be issued if there is no
response

01:03:40.849 --> 01:03:40.859 align:start position:0%
response
 
01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
right so that's also another way to
 
01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
mitigate this liability that's on the
 
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
book you're doing that for all all
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
credits not just over 500 but it work
 
01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
right it's like you currently have X
 
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
number of dollars on account with us
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
yeah you want to use them or you want to
 
01:03:57.049 --> 01:03:57.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
okay sounds good
 
01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:03.589 align:start position:0%
okay sounds good
next

01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so and the last item here on page
 
01:04:11.569 --> 01:04:11.579 align:start position:0%
17 that is the insurance premium taxes
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and this is a credit against the
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
business profits tax so the uh insurance
 
01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
companies that pays his insurance
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
premium taxes the the premiums that they
 
01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
pay can be used to offset against the
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
business profits taxes
 
01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:26.870 align:start position:0%
business profits taxes
um

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:29.089 --> 01:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
and here the
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
total credits used against BPT for in
 
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 came up to about 44
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the total number of
 
01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
taxpayers utilizing this credit was uh
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
273 taxpayers
 
01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
so that that 44 million dollars that the
 
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
state took that in as taxes on insurance
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
companies and then they deducted it from
 
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
their BPT yep okay
 
01:04:54.289 --> 01:04:54.299 align:start position:0%
so it's one or the other I mean right
 
01:04:54.299 --> 01:04:55.490 align:start position:0%
so it's one or the other I mean right
yeah

01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
01:04:59.030 --> 01:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
did you have a question
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
no I no I just want to make sure that
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
the 273 doesn't represent represents
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
insurance companies not you know in some
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
form that's paying this premium this
 
01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
insurance premium tax and then we're
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
just saying that you can take that off
 
01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:13.619 align:start position:0%
your off your business profits tax right
 
01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
that those are the uh insurance
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
companies that claimed the ipt against
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
the BPT
 
01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
all right the other
 
01:05:29.569 --> 01:05:29.579 align:start position:0%
do you have anything else or is that
 
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
pretty much it all right that's that's
 
01:05:33.049 --> 01:05:33.059 align:start position:0%
pretty much it so we'll be starting to
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
prepare the fiscal year 23 report uh
 
01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
later in the year
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
um and um we I think so this this report
 
01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:44.700 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year 22 report was uh was
 
01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:47.579 align:start position:0%
issued on December 22 so the fiscal year
 
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
23 report likely will be around the same
 
01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
time frame in terms of when it will be
 
01:05:54.049 --> 01:05:54.059 align:start position:0%
issued and for the purposes of this
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
committee we have to have a report uh
 
01:05:59.930 --> 01:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
done by November 1st so we won't be able
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
to include any of that of course but um
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
just like the previous committee to us
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
um looked at 2021 and wrote a report in
 
01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:12.829 align:start position:0%
um looked at 2021 and wrote a report in
2022

01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
. I'm sorry Mr chair I think my bank
 
01:06:18.049 --> 01:06:18.059 align:start position:0%
yeah the summary so there were there
 
01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
were a couple basic things were asking
 
01:06:21.309 --> 01:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
for you to come back with information
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
one was the question around who pays bet
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
and understanding better what that looks
 
01:06:29.329 --> 01:06:29.339 align:start position:0%
like and who's exempt from the BET and
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
then the other items were about the
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
liability on the credit carryovers what
 
01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
that looks like you know how it's going
 
01:06:38.809 --> 01:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
to be hit against future revenues
 
01:06:41.809 --> 01:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.809 --> 01:06:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.329 --> 01:06:59.339 align:start position:0%
okay next on our agenda is discussing
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna definitely need a little help
 
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
here figuring this out if I look at
 
01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
representative abrami's report from last
 
01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.349 align:start position:0%
representative abrami's report from last
year

01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
they they did and actually Senator were
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
you on uh last year okay so just uh
 
01:07:21.289 --> 01:07:21.299 align:start position:0%
representative Ames I believe was here
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
last year so yeah um so it looks like
 
01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
representative Ames last year the
 
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
committee addressed
 
01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
uh three of the seven
 
01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:33.410 align:start position:0%
uh three of the seven
um

01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
tax expenditures but did not it looks
 
01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.710 align:start position:0%
tax expenditures but did not it looks
like

01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:37.430 align:start position:0%
like
um

01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
do not move forward with four of them
 
01:07:42.049 --> 01:07:42.059 align:start position:0%
the education tax credit
 
01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
The revitalization Zone tax credit the
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
koas County job creation tax credit
 
01:07:50.809 --> 01:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
and the Community Development Finance
 
01:07:50.819 --> 01:07:53.210 align:start position:0%
and the Community Development Finance
Authority

01:07:53.210 --> 01:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
so it I mean it probably makes sense for
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
I mean the fact that
 
01:08:02.089 --> 01:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
well I guess I I have just a general
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
question that you may be able to answer
 
01:08:05.809 --> 01:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
representative Ames is that our our
 
01:08:08.089 --> 01:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
report is supposed to be in by November
 
01:08:08.099 --> 01:08:09.349 align:start position:0%
report is supposed to be in by November
1st

01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
1st
 
01:08:09.359 --> 01:08:10.069 align:start position:0%
1st
um

01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
is that the end of this committee at
 
01:08:14.809 --> 01:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
that point I had the same question I
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
didn't look at the statute uh is it here
 
01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
I mean I'd be okay if it was plenty of
 
01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:25.140 align:start position:0%
other things
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
yeah what happened last year after you
 
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
after that report that ran along and we
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
ran out of members uh Senator resigned
 
01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:35.450 align:start position:0%
ran out of members uh Senator resigned
and

01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
he was gone and uh just uh abrahamian me
 
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
but then but then that was he was he
 
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
dropped out before the November 1st so
 
01:08:48.349 --> 01:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
then November 1st report came out and
 
01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
then did you guys do anything after
 
01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
November 1st oh no okay we were done
 
01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:54.709 align:start position:0%
November 1st oh no okay we were done
um

01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
so it says
 
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
it's funny The Joint Committee on tax
 
01:09:00.289 --> 01:09:00.299 align:start position:0%
suspended reviews hereby has established
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
a review all qualifying taxes Spenders
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
on a rotating basis every five years
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
um and recommended continuous Amendment
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
a repeal of relevant Provisions right
 
01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
that's our charge right
 
01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:13.430 align:start position:0%
that's our charge right
um

01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
first being recall within 90-day
 
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
because every November 1st thereafter
 
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
The Joint Committee shall plan for any
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
tax expenditures or subsequently enacted
 
01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
or amended and Report required so I'm
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
guessing it's an ongoing yeah that's the
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
way we do that's where we treated that
 
01:09:38.209 --> 01:09:38.219 align:start position:0%
last time so we did a
 
01:09:41.209 --> 01:09:41.219 align:start position:0%
I guess we call it an internal report of
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
some sort for
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
what is now this November right and then
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
we did a fuller report a year later so
 
01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
the this report that we're talking about
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
right now was just to cover ourselves
 
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
basically and say we've had a meeting
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
and discuss lessons so and uh
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
and a few more things I'm sure we can
 
01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
find it and um and then we carried on so
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
we weren't done okay yeah so
 
01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.229 align:start position:0%
we weren't done okay yeah so
um

01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
are presumably our our committee would
 
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
then produce another report for 2024 or
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
November 1st and then the committee
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
would be done because now it's a new
 
01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:26.460 align:start position:0%
biennium right that's what happens okay
 
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
so so when that new report comes I mean
 
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
there'll be no rush to I mean after
 
01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
November 1st we probably don't have to
 
01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
meet again for
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
a while
 
01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
um yeah whatever that means but we'll
 
01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
figure it out based on
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of us are new so we we
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
don't know how much work is it going to
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
take and depending on what we see and
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
what we feel like we still need to do we
 
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
can figure what we did was
 
01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:55.729 align:start position:0%
can figure what we did was
um

01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
I believe the report
 
01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
the November this year report was short
 
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
and reported that we met around
 
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
um had a presentation from dra right
 
01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.229 align:start position:0%
um had a presentation from dra right
um

01:11:11.229 --> 01:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
and might identify maybe we should agree
 
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
on this a plan to
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
proceed to develop information on the
 
01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.810 align:start position:0%
proceed to develop information on the
before

01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:25.130 align:start position:0%
before
um

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
tax expenditure programs that are
 
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned in a brownies report as not
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
having been addressed yet right
 
01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
um and uh that would be our plan then
 
01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
then we would get together
 
01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
as soon as we can
 
01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:43.790 align:start position:0%
as soon as we can
um

01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
right given all the other things that
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
are going to be happening to us and
 
01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:51.900 align:start position:0%
try to get it done and I know last time
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
around we just ran out of
 
01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
time and Personnel because we lost some
 
01:11:58.729 --> 01:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
of the Guida and it was a three-person
 
01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
community to start with so we were in
 
01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
trouble and uh we
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
decided not to go much further and
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
basically report it out so the
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
requirement for November 1st is every
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
November 1st thereafter The Joint
 
01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
Committee shall file a report with
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations for proposed legislation
 
01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
including identification and review
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh plan for any tax expenditures that
 
01:12:24.490 --> 01:12:24.500 align:start position:0%
was subsequently enacted or amended
 
01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
so I guess considering we did the three
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
I guess my recommendation was take the
 
01:12:32.209 --> 01:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
four that weren't done last year yeah
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
and then I understand we're gonna do the
 
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
three next year yeah 24. right so let's
 
01:12:38.209 --> 01:12:38.219 align:start position:0%
keep that cycling of four this year
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
three next year four Vision that makes
 
01:12:42.649 --> 01:12:42.659 align:start position:0%
sense that makes sense uh the four
 
01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
includes the education tax credit which
 
01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:46.850 align:start position:0%
includes the education tax credit which
we

01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
we've received information on but we
 
01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:50.470 align:start position:0%
we've received information on but we
didn't

01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:12:53.209 --> 01:12:53.219 align:start position:0%
we didn't engage in the discussion and
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
Analysis that we needed to do as a
 
01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
committee so it was incomplete that's
 
01:12:59.570 --> 01:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
why it's on the list so who came and
 
01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
talked here though the uh Kate Baker
 
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
the director of
 
01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
the scholarship program organization
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
came and talked with talked to us I
 
01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
guess I can I could reach out to um dra
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
on on those four and find out who yeah I
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
think is that yeah it was the uh in the
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
other cases the
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh what's it called the business and
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
development uh
 
01:13:35.229 --> 01:13:35.239 align:start position:0%
the the agency that administers the
 
01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
uh I think the revitalization the cdfa
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
oh yeah tax credit there are different
 
01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
different amenities
 
01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:44.450 align:start position:0%
different amenities
um yeah

01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
so I don't have that on top of it all
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
um and then what you know to my question
 
01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:52.669 align:start position:0%
um and then what you know to my question
earlier

01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
the um you know you have the seven and
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
then then it looks like there's four
 
01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.149 align:start position:0%
then then it looks like there's four
other

01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
liabilities and it doesn't seem like
 
01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
that's not mentioned in abrami's report
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
have the data oh okay
 
01:14:14.159 --> 01:14:18.790 align:start position:0%
have the data oh okay
yeah

01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:27.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:14:27.709 --> 01:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
yeah and I don't I don't know where I
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
got mine I when I first was the first
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
listed House member and I had no idea
 
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
what this committee even did I asked for
 
01:14:39.169 --> 01:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
some information and I and I got
 
01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
so again the two items that are required
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
on the report is potential liabilities
 
01:14:45.169 --> 01:14:45.179 align:start position:0%
against State revenues specifically
 
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
lists out some tax credits
 
01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
um and then credit carry uh and credit
 
01:14:54.169 --> 01:14:54.179 align:start position:0%
carryovers so those are kind of the two
 
01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
that's listed on here we have to
 
01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
identify so it's not addressing nol or
 
01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise well I don't know I
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
have to go look at just get statute
 
01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
numbers oh I don't know what all those
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
strategy numbers are so we'd have to go
 
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
through and look up what each one of
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
those statues represents okay um it's
 
01:15:12.010 --> 01:15:12.020 align:start position:0%
like other credits allowed on RSA 77
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
77-a 77-e 77-g78 78-a 78-b 82
 
01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.010 align:start position:0%
77-a 77-e 77-g78 78-a 78-b 82
82-83-e

01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:21.020 align:start position:0%
82-83-e
 
01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
84-84-c and RSA 400-a against the
 
01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
business profit Stacks so I don't know
 
01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
what all those credit programs and carry
 
01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
forward programs are by those rsas we
 
01:15:32.689 --> 01:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
probably need to identify those and make
 
01:15:32.699 --> 01:15:40.390 align:start position:0%
probably need to identify those and make
um yeah

01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so that report
 
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
I have
 
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
so that report doesn't even address any
 
01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
of those yeah that's what I'm saying I
 
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
don't I don't so I think it was because
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
they ran short they ran out of time and
 
01:15:59.570 --> 01:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
they gave what they had they gave and
 
01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
the rest be damned so we and and we may
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
not be able to address all that given
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
our tight time frame now well we have
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
two years right so I think that we can
 
01:16:13.010 --> 01:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
specify you just say that these these
 
01:16:14.810 --> 01:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
Provisions will be carrying forward to
 
01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
2024 November first report yeah I just
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
meant by this November 1st We're Not
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
Gonna no no no no no so and I think you
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
know you just use common sense and right
 
01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
do what you can do and don't worry about
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
it so let's maybe we start with Senator
 
01:16:39.729 --> 01:16:39.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
there was a huge concern of norms
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
that as we as we what he worried about
 
01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
was this
 
01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
Cloud hanging over us that might
 
01:16:57.770 --> 01:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
cause damage and that the cloud was that
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
there were businesses out there who had
 
01:17:02.689 --> 01:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
on deposit with the state a huge amount
 
01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
of money and they might someday
 
01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
uh look at the crystal ball and say
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
whoops it's time for us to take all that
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
money back well my my concern is that in
 
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
talking to him in that conversation was
 
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
again if now we're being forced to issue
 
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
refunds what's that look like and maybe
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
we need to consider consider legislation
 
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
as spread that out a little longer
 
01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
rather than a two-year cycle getting
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
down from 500 to 100 yeah so maybe
 
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's possible legislation we want to
 
01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
consider to not have as a drastic of an
 
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
impact some of that on my back but some
 
01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
of that may be answered when he comes
 
01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
back when we get the numbers some
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
additional information
 
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
is you know era has addressed the
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:56.689 --> 01:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
they just send it back yeah
 
01:17:59.050 --> 01:17:59.060 align:start position:0%
what talk about it cascading effect
 
01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:01.820 align:start position:0%
what's what effect is that going to have
 
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
or that's
 
01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:07.250 align:start position:0%
or that's
door

01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
right yeah that's why Senator Lang is
 
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
saying maybe we stretched that out
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
because it who knows yeah yeah it's 100
 
01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
a year we reduce it by over the next
 
01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
five years rather than a 500 to zero 500
 
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
to 100 over two years it's it's that's
 
01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
fast yeah
 
01:18:26.209 --> 01:18:26.219 align:start position:0%
okay um so then
 
01:18:28.610 --> 01:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
for the next meeting maybe we try to get
 
01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
those for
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
um I'll have to find out who the experts
 
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
are in those four areas and we'll have
 
01:18:39.169 --> 01:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
presentations on on those four
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
you probably can't do them all at once
 
01:18:44.810 --> 01:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
too much too much
 
01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:47.050 align:start position:0%
too much too much
um

01:18:47.050 --> 01:18:47.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
each one has has a constituent suit
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
which one so they were idiot day right
 
01:18:58.669 --> 01:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
the economic revitalization tax credit
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
yeah r d was that already in his report
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
that's already done yeah so that costs
 
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
County jobs County the education tax
 
01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
credit was done but we'll need to review
 
01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
it again next year okay yeah the CT was
 
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
done wasn't it well wait a minute he
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
listed it as not being done well he
 
01:19:15.719 --> 01:19:18.930 align:start position:0%
listed it as not being done well he
listed

01:19:18.930 --> 01:19:18.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:20.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
there is a conclusions of required hacks
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
so they did do an assessment of it but
 
01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
they just didn't you know they said
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
needs that needs a deeper dive as well
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
so again we're going to do a deeper dive
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
we're just going to put it off to the
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
next okay all right so so what you're
 
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
proposing is um
 
01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:39.590 align:start position:0%
proposing is um
cdfa

01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
cdfa
 
01:19:43.209 --> 01:19:43.219 align:start position:0%
cdfa economic revitalization koas County
 
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
it's all on the front page well again
 
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
the insurance premium tax credit right
 
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
those are the four that he really didn't
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
do it aren't talked about really in this
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
report at all oh I see right those are
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
the four tax credits listed by dra as an
 
01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.689 align:start position:0%
the four tax credits listed by dra as an
expenditure

01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
um that we have to look at plus right we
 
01:20:11.709 --> 01:20:11.719 align:start position:0%
have this other these other liability
 
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
under additional item the nol Enterprise
 
01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
tax credit and
 
01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
um credit carry forward which I think we
 
01:20:21.530 --> 01:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
should do the credit carry forward this
 
01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:22.490 align:start position:0%
should do the credit carry forward this
year

01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
right an analysis we should
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
until we get five items for this report
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:42.169 --> 01:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
and they are again cdfa economic koas
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
County insurance tax premium and the
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:50.209 --> 01:20:50.219 align:start position:0%
and we should maybe focus on those on
 
01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
the next coming meetings
 
01:20:55.610 --> 01:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
um insurance tax premium so that wasn't
 
01:20:57.169 --> 01:20:57.179 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
01:20:58.729 --> 01:20:58.739 align:start position:0%
four that he didn't get done though
 
01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
right but it's these are listed again
 
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
I'm using dras acknowledge so again if
 
01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
you go to page five they list an
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
overview of tax expenditures and amounts
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
right you know the insurance one is uh
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
not very exciting I suppose yeah I'm
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
sure it's going to be a really quick but
 
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
again we should at least have it someone
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
come in and talk to us about it make
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
sure we're okay and yeah yeah one one
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph and we're done
 
01:21:23.209 --> 01:21:23.219 align:start position:0%
but at least we reviewed it and had a
 
01:21:24.649 --> 01:21:24.659 align:start position:0%
conversation with somebody
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
all right so cdfa
 
01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
Economic Development
 
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
call us
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
Cross County insurance tax credit
 
01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
premium credit and then a credit card
 
01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
repo which is going to be the big one I
 
01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:38.870 align:start position:0%
repo which is going to be the big one I
think

01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.189 align:start position:0%
think
okay

01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
well that's we're talking hundreds about
 
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars versus
 
01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:44.930 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars versus
these

01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
you know right okay so credit carry
 
01:21:52.610 --> 01:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
forward is dra yeah
 
01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
insurances insurance
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
um the way insurance department and dra
 
01:22:01.610 --> 01:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
okay coax County I'll have to find out
 
01:22:04.570 --> 01:22:04.580 align:start position:0%
who they recommend
 
01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
the subject we may also choose to do
 
01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
next to nothing we just need to have a
 
01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
statement and a report about it because
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
if you remember right the goess county
 
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
one expires
 
01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
yeah but it doesn't expire until
 
01:22:18.890 --> 01:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
November when the expiration get a
 
01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:20.750 align:start position:0%
November when the expiration get a
breakdown

01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
breakdown
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
but I thought they said that expired one
 
01:22:26.290 --> 01:22:26.300 align:start position:0%
of them does you know
 
01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
for some reason I'm thinking 2028 but
 
01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
that's what that com someone said 20 25
 
01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:40.130 --> 01:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
well I'll find out if it may just be a
 
01:22:41.570 --> 01:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
matter of we just say that it's due to
 
01:22:44.689 --> 01:22:44.699 align:start position:0%
expire we recommend it we allow it right
 
01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
simple enough but we may still want to
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
have somebody either send a statement so
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
that'll be if I'm not mistaken right
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh
 
01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.290 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh
um

01:22:54.290 --> 01:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:58.669 --> 01:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
so Bea does that Taylor Caswell so he
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
would have that's right yeah he would
 
01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
come in both for co-ops and the economic
 
01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
revitalization his agency is the one
 
01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
that manages that okay we'd have cdfa
 
01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
come in to talk about the cdfa tax
 
01:23:14.209 --> 01:23:14.219 align:start position:0%
credit and it's
 
01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
and the premium insurance of the
 
01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
I mean it would be nice if we try to
 
01:23:22.490 --> 01:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
try to hit all five of these at the next
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
meeting because then at that meeting we
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
can then discuss it after you know we
 
01:23:30.530 --> 01:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
hear the input and say okay can we put
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
together a report
 
01:23:33.890 --> 01:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
and not meet again
 
01:23:35.930 --> 01:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
or the way to meet again that would be
 
01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
fine uh I I'm just thinking of my
 
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
schedule is so packed between now and
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
then I'm sure you guys Senators have a
 
01:23:43.199 --> 01:23:45.290 align:start position:0%
then I'm sure you guys Senators have a
uh

01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:47.930 --> 01:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
so if we can do it I'd rather I mean
 
01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
would you rather I mean we could start a
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
little earlier too we started at 10 30
 
01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
today because representative Ames had a
 
01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:55.790 align:start position:0%
today because representative Ames had a
conflict

01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
um if we started a little earlier I
 
01:23:59.950 --> 01:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what's the earliest
 
01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
nine everyone's okay with nine actually
 
01:24:05.630 --> 01:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
let's try to figure out a date
 
01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.750 align:start position:0%
let's try to figure out a date
um

01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
and then you know we might be done by 12
 
01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
and that way we got through them
 
01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:16.070 align:start position:0%
and that way we got through them
okay

01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:22.370 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:29.689 --> 01:24:29.699 align:start position:0%
Monday October 16th look
 
01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
what was the date I'm sorry Monday
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%

01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
what is it I don't know what is it
 
01:25:04.330 --> 01:25:04.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
they've sent out a lot of notices yeah
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean you can't do the 17th I can
 
01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:16.920 align:start position:0%

01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
I have a dedicated funds committee
 
01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:20.510 align:start position:0%
I have a dedicated funds committee
meeting

01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:25:23.209 --> 01:25:23.219 align:start position:0%
on the 18th yeah 19th I have Ways and
 
01:25:23.219 --> 01:25:25.030 align:start position:0%
on the 18th yeah 19th I have Ways and
Means

01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
Means
 
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm available Friday the 20th I
 
01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:30.290 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm available Friday the 20th I
guess

01:25:30.290 --> 01:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
getting

01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
at that point we're probably gonna have
 
01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
to finish up in or at least have a
 
01:25:37.850 --> 01:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
preliminary report
 
01:25:40.729 --> 01:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
um does Friday I like to try to stay
 
01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:42.780 align:start position:0%
away from Fridays but does Friday the
 
01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
20th works for me it's okay if we go
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
back a week what's that instead of a
 
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
Friday when we look at like Tuesday the
 
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
10th left over uh Tuesday the 10th I'm
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
sadly I'm in La for a few days wow
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
because the the earliest I can do it
 
01:26:08.209 --> 01:26:08.219 align:start position:0%
for that I mean I think next week is
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
probably too quick
 
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
actually I've got something
 
01:26:14.209 --> 01:26:14.219 align:start position:0%
if I got something scheduled oh no
 
01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
Thursday Thursday the 28th
 
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
you know now we're pushing again report
 
01:26:20.209 --> 01:26:20.219 align:start position:0%
deadline November one
 
01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
no no I'm back in September now oh
 
01:26:24.169 --> 01:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
September 28th but I don't know if

01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%

01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%

but
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%

spanium will take that long they
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%

able to get through them all and
 
01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
