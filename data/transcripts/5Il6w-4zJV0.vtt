Bill
 
00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 align:start position:0%
1646 um it um when I um when I put the
 
00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 align:start position:0%
bill in um it it was it was basically
 
00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.430 align:start position:0%
bill in um it it was it was basically
designed

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
designed
 
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
to add a um uh really a hard floor to uh
 
00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 align:start position:0%
re what what I would say would be the
 
00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 align:start position:0%
the most basic of standards for our
 
00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
public charter schools that um that
 
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
those schools would be private
 
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
corporations Incorporated under the laws
 
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and shall operate in
 
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 align:start position:0%
fact the the existing language says
 
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
secular organization and I added
 
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
501c3 corporation uh everything else in
 
00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 align:start position:0%
here is the same except uh except we did
 
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
add the word secular to one other arean
 
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
statute uh where it was um inadvertently
 
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
um uh absent and uh legislative Services
 
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
did uh did all the drafting on this but
 
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 align:start position:0%
um but I don't want to focus so much on
 
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
the on the current language and like I
 
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
said really really sort of minor changes
 
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
on this but but um shortly after uh
 
00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
after I filed it and um as um as as the
 
00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
um Bill text became uh public or or not
 
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
maybe not necessarily public but went to
 
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 align:start position:0%
departments for fiscal analysis and and
 
00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
um and comments I did receive a call
 
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
from um from Ms Davis over at the
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
department of Ed saying that uh that she
 
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
has for the last um several months been
 
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
involved in conversations with the
 
00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice relative to
 
00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for um for Charter
 
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
School approval and um that uh they were
 
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
hoping to find a bill that could be used
 
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 align:start position:0%
amended uh for the um the
 
00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 align:start position:0%
recommendations that uh that they were
 
00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 align:start position:0%
working on and I said well look um
 
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn I'd be be more than delighted
 
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
more than happy to work with you and the
 
00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
department of Ed and the Department of
 
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
Justice on um on any sort of um
 
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
suggested changes you have on this and
 
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
and happy to use this as a vehicle for
 
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
that so um just um yesterday and this is
 
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 align:start position:0%
an email that I've just passed around
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
the room actually represent Cordell you
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
feel you know the the email actually
 
00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 align:start position:0%
came to representative cordelli into me
 
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
so um so and and and I hope
 
00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli has had a chance
 
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 align:start position:0%
to to give it a look see um that uh that
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
uh that Miss Davis would like to have
 
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to use uh 1646 as a
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle for um uh for standards in her
 
00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
email she uses the word retain I believe
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
what what she means there cuz we don't
 
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
retain bills in the second year and
 
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 align:start position:0%
interim study doesn't e even further her
 
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
her you know their interest to make um
 
00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
to make statutory changes I think she
 
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
means amend um in this that's certainly
 
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
what she indicated to me when we uh when
 
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
we spoke um earlier this winter uh on
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
this um I have not seen what uh what the
 
00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the Department of
 
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
Ed or the department of Justice are when
 
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
it comes to minimum standards or revised
 
00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for uh for Charter
 
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
School uh approval and uh and it may be
 
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
related to to some recent events that um
 
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
that that that um uh the Department of
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
Education is uh and Department of
 
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 align:start position:0%
Justice are working from uh but um but I
 
00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:24.759 align:start position:0%
guess you know we're we're obviously you
 
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
know not executing bills today I don't
 
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
believe this is well it's certainly not
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
an early because we wrapped those up
 
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday so we've got some time I think
 
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
to um to to uh to address this and uh
 
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
would appreciate the committee's
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
Indulgence in um in working with the
 
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 align:start position:0%
Departments of education and Justice on
 
00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 align:start position:0%
um on any necessary changes that uh that
 
00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
they feel uh should be made to um uh uh
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
to the framework for Charter School
 
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
approval so with that I'm happy to take
 
00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
any questions but but really I think I I
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
I think it would even make more sense to
 
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
save questions from when we hear more
 
00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
from from uh doe and
 
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 align:start position:0%
doj uh I do have one question for you uh
 
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
just getting some clarification here
 
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
you're modifying the definition for
 
00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:16.759 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School under Roman 4 and
 
00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:18.909 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School under Roman 4 and
194

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:18.919 align:start position:0%
194
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
B1 um and there if you went down to
 
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
Roman five in that same section of law
 
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
you see a definition for the charter
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
conversions school which is a charter
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
that is a result of a local board and
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
Community decision correct it could go
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
further sometime down the road in years
 
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
and that Charter
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
Public Charter conversion school could
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
become a Charter Public School correct
 
00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
so in any way does this language right
 
00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:52.629 align:start position:0%
so in any way does this language right
here

00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
impact the nature of a charter
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
conversion school I believe it does um
 
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
and a charter Charter conversion school
 
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
if if my memory service me is a is a is
 
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
a locally
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
chartered it's it's a local Charter
 
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
School designed by the school board
 
00:08:14.909 --> 00:08:14.919 align:start position:0%
right not the State Board not the state
 
00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
board and the funding comes to that
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
Charter conversion School the way it
 
00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
does previously to the school board from
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
the state however there's different you
 
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
know 80% and all that within the
 
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
definition right right and and and and
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
um and the the the the direct grants
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
from the state are different from for
 
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
Charter conversions than they are for
 
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
state board approved um Charter Schools
 
00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this touches on
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
both of those because that was the um
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
that was the at the Crux of the
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
conversation that I had with legislative
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
Services during Drafting and um and and
 
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
that's why they spent the time to uh to
 
00:08:59.389 --> 00:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
do the to do the drafting on this uh I
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
don't know to what extent the
 
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
Departments of education and Justice
 
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
would would see that the minimum
 
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
standards for Charter conversion schools
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
would be different than than um uh than
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
stateboard chartered uh uh Charter
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
Schools but clearly those are two very
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
different um uh organizations because
 
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
one of them uh reports up through the
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
locally elected School Board and has has
 
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.910 align:start position:0%
locally elected School Board and has has
the

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
the and the that school board is
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
fiscally is is fiduciary acting as a
 
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsible for that charter
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
school and obviously the taxpayers that
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
that support it where a um stateboard uh
 
00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:49.959 align:start position:0%
Charter charter school does not have
 
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:53.240 align:start position:0%
that same line of of governance just
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
follow up to that I I'm just trying to
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
eliminate any possible conflict or
 
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
confusion here we're in the amendment on
 
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
line three in the bill it says Charter
 
00:10:09.069 --> 00:10:09.079 align:start position:0%
Public School is a private Corporation
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
comma yeah then under five Roman five it
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
says the charter conversion School means
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
a public school is there any confusion
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
here resulting from the language where
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
one place we're saying a charter is a
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
public school is a private Corporation
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
but here you're you were saying that a
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
charter conversion school is a public
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
school I I don't think so and I don't
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
have the the law book in in front of me
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
but but Roman 4 I believe is is directed
 
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
to charter schools that are chartered by
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
the state board Roman 5 and it does
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.949 align:start position:0%
 
three

00:10:59.949 --> 00:10:59.959 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
and in section four in section three and
 
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
four and like I said that's where
 
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
legislative Services felt they needed to
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh make sure that there was
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
clarity thank you representa
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you um thank you
 
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:22.519 align:start position:0%
representative um yeah I I did receive
 
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
that letter and um I have talked with uh
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
Miss Davis uh several times um uh in the
 
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
past month or so um about uh the issue
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
and uh they have been working on a
 
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:39.160 align:start position:0%
really a
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
rewrite of the uh Charter School chapter
 
00:11:46.629 --> 00:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
of law because it is
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
um has gotten a little bit confusing uh
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
between you know locally um chartered
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
schools and state chartered uh schools
 
00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
um so they've been trying to do a
 
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
complete rewrite and um we did talk
 
00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
about this as being a vehicle for that
 
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
um but uh last time um I talked with uh
 
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
them uh they were not
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
ready for um uh introduction of any
 
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment and it's my impression that um
 
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
they might not be ready um until next
 
00:12:28.189 --> 00:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
year um so I think maybe that's what she
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
was addressing with the um retained
 
00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
comment um in the letter um but uh I uh
 
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
um had sent her a note about getting
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
together on other topics um so I will
 
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
follow up with her to see if they have
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
any hope of um any um language being
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
ready by the time that we need to uh get
 
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
a bill out in March no I appreciate that
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
Cordell I'll follow up with m Davis um
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
on it uh on this as well um you know
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
obviously if they're thinking next year
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
it would just be submitted as a new bill
 
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
so you wouldn't have to interim study
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
retain or anything on on on this it
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
would be um not um U not used as a
 
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle at all but uh but if it um if if
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
if between um uh if if the Departments
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
of education and and and um and Justice
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
have have some immediate changes that
 
00:13:31.949 --> 00:13:31.959 align:start position:0%
they feel need to be need to be put in
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
place particularly in light of you know
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
recent bankruptcies and and insolvencies
 
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
um uh at at se Coast SE Coast did
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
receive I think almost a million and a
 
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
half dollars in the um in the charter
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
startup Grant Charter and expansion
 
00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:49.959 align:start position:0%
Grant so so at least from what I've read
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
in the newspaper there's allegations of
 
00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
Fraud and financial misuse uh in that so
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
where that million a half dollars wound
 
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
up I I don't know and I think it may be
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
something that the Department of Justice
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
and the department of education do want
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
to get a better handle on obviously we
 
00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
just passed a bill on the house floor
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
that would U that would open the door
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
for charter schools to participate in
 
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
the um School building aid program those
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
are also public monies and uh and should
 
00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:20.839 align:start position:0%
School building Aid go to a charter that
 
00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
then subsequently um becomes insolvent
 
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
uh we need to make sure we understand
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
what happened to that money we need to
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
understand um uh any obligations that
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
that the charter may have in terms of
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
liquidating assets or whatever assets
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
that do remain um um uh to to ACR to
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
what organizations benefit and um and
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
that uh and that we're not um you know
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
that we we don't have loopholes in there
 
00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:50.839 align:start position:0%
for for fraud and Corruption I think
 
00:14:52.749 --> 00:14:52.759 align:start position:0%
that's why the Department of Justice is
 
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
so interested in this Bill yes uh we
 
00:14:58.509 --> 00:14:58.519 align:start position:0%
talked about disillusion earlier this
 
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
year here represent
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um of course I
 
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
don't have any Amendment so I'm just
 
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
going to look at the bill as is and
 
00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
despite being a relatively short bill it
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
seems to me like it does a lot um and
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
without digging into a lot because we
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
don't get to do that right at this
 
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
minute I'd just like to look at one or
 
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
two things real quick especially uh
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
starting under uh Roman
 
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
4 um part of the change here is that the
 
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
organization must be incorpor ated under
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
the laws of New Hampshire that strikes
 
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
me as something we previously learned
 
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
about in a different Bill what we
 
00:15:39.069 --> 00:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
learned was that it can potentially take
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
time a year perhaps longer for an
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
organization that might be organized out
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
of state to reorganize inst state so do
 
00:15:48.309 --> 00:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
you know how many if any current
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
existing Charter Schools would be
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
disqualified under that change so thank
 
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
you for the question my understanding is
 
00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
that current law does require our um our
 
00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
Charters to be Incorporated in New
 
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's that's different than
 
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
than what is in other states it just
 
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen to be in this section
 
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere else um uh so my my
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it would not
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
change uh uh any of our existing
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
Charters or the practices that existing
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
Charters use to uh to form in New
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the the F however and I and I
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
don't mean to jump ahead and imply
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
things in your question that that
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
weren't there that the requirement to be
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
a 501 C3 at the time of establishment
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
may may um may need to be looked at
 
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
again because there may be other uh
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
another IRS code that uh that a charter
 
00:16:43.629 --> 00:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
gets established under uh uh Miss
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
Davis's U memo references that but also
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
says that um that there's at least I
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
think she she um says that there was
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's one um where their their current
 
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
IRS status uh of not being a 501c3 is
 
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
getting in their way of uh of receiving
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
um a u a bank note or something like
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
that so so I think there are some some
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
serious things that would need to be be
 
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.079 align:start position:0%
changed in the the bill as presented and
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
that's why you know waiting for um for U
 
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
some sort of feedback and guidance from
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
doj and doe I think would be uh would be
 
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.590 align:start position:0%
doj and doe I think would be uh would be
good

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
thank you yes it looks she said it could
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
be retained for a study committee and
 
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
whether that's changing amending it to
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
an actual study committee or just
 
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
keeping it for interim study because she
 
00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
also says she wants to work on it
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
through this summer so that but rather
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
than just
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
leaving doe to work on it if we did it
 
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
as a group then we would have input as
 
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
well absolutely open to if if if wanted
 
00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
to turn this into a study committee or
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
something like that I I I think that's a
 
00:18:05.549 --> 00:18:05.559 align:start position:0%
perfectly good use for this bill further
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
questions represented
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you Mr chair just a point of
 
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
information one of the reasons why we
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
have successful charter schools in the
 
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
state is because of the
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
rigorous process that one goes through
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
to get a charter and it would seem to me
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
that this kind of a when you talk about
 
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.310 align:start position:0%
that this kind of a when you talk about
the

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
501c3 that this could be part of that
 
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
process and and and as I understand it
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
at least somebody told me at one point
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
in time it takes anywhere from once
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
somebody decides they want to move
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
forward with the charter it takes
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 18 months to 24 months to
 
00:18:47.149 --> 00:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
get one started and that this process of
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
the IRS regulations Etc could be is
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
could be part it may even be part of the
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
process right now because of the
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
rigorous nature of obtaining a charter
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
are there any questions further
 
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
questions of the represent yes represent
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
Ry you thank you thanks for taking my
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
question and this is just technical um
 
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
in the part in line seven it says you're
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
appealing RSA B3 yes Roman numeral 3A is
 
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
repealed it's already repealed in the
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
statutes and then reenacted and I'm just
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
wondering how you do that I this is
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
where leg of services came in on that
 
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
and I I noticed that as well thank you
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
are there further questions for
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
represent luno not see thank you very
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
much great thank you very much do we
 
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
have anybody else here today that would
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
Bill not seeing thank you very
 
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
much and so we have no further cards so
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to close the hearing
 
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.230 align:start position:0%
we're going to close the hearing
for

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.159 --> 00:31:56.149 align:start position:0%
 
10:45

00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.159 --> 00:41:36.990 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
we're ready to go ahead with the next
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
bill it is
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
10:45 by the clock in this time zone uh
 
00:41:47.069 --> 00:41:47.079 align:start position:0%
HB 1087 is what we're looking at this is
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
a bill established in a commission to
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
study information literacy and media
 
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
literacy instruction public schools and
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
I welcome represent Paige
 
00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
chairman nice to see you all
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
again all right in in
 
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
2016 Stanford University's history
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
education group conducted a study on
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
youth media literacy skills in the
 
00:42:12.359 --> 00:42:13.870 align:start position:0%
youth media literacy skills in the
United

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
United
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
States this was their headline
 
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
conclusion young people's ability to
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
reason about information on the internet
 
00:42:27.549 --> 00:42:27.559 align:start position:0%
can be summed up in one word bleak
 
00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:29.480 align:start position:0%
in a more recent study of 100,000
 
00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
students conducted by the nonprofit news
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
literacy project approximately four in
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
10 students could not recognize that a
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
meme about genetically modified
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
organisms did not contain strong
 
00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
evidence for an accompanying false claim
 
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
about their
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
safety in study after study we're
 
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
finding that our students are not
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
adequately equipped for navigating
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
information in our 21st century world
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
so now for the good
 
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
news in the years since the Stanford
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
study was first
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
published more and more states have
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
risen to the challenge of closing this
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
media literacy skills
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
Gap 20 states have now passed
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
legislation focused on improving student
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
skills in this area giving New Hampshire
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
abundant and varied models to consider
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
evaluate learn learn from and adapt to
 
00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
our local
 
00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
needs New Hampshire can and should add
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
our name to the list of states that are
 
00:43:38.589 --> 00:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
committed to equipping our students with
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
the necessary skills to navigate today's
 
00:43:44.829 --> 00:43:44.839 align:start position:0%
complex media landscape responsibly and
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
critically which is why I'm here today
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
1087 students media and information
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
literacy abilities are not only ESS
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
ential Workforce skills they're also
 
00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
foundational to their duties as
 
00:44:04.829 --> 00:44:04.839 align:start position:0%
responsible citizens and critical
 
00:44:08.549 --> 00:44:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:11.079 align:start position:0%
well-being the nationaly of science
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
engineering and Medicine uh just last
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
year in December recommended in their
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
report on social media and Adolescent
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
Health that media literacy education
 
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
currently suffers from scarce funding
 
00:44:26.829 --> 00:44:26.839 align:start position:0%
uneven content poorly qualified
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
instructors and a lack of reference
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
standard all four of these issues should
 
00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.230 align:start position:0%
standard all four of these issues should
be

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
addressed it goes on further to note
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
that teachers are important ambassadors
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
in educating and continually mentoring
 
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
young people on how to address and
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
remain aware of new technological Trends
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
and as such need to be educated
 
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
themselves initially and on an ongoing
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
basis on effective ways to teach media
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
literacy so in other words it's not just
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
the students it's also ensuring that our
 
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:03.640 align:start position:0%
educators are are equipped to provide uh
 
00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:06.870 align:start position:0%
educators are are equipped to provide uh
this

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
instruction last year the US surgeon
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
general's advisory on social media and
 
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
youth mental health also explicitly
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
recommended that policy makers support
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
the development implementation and
 
00:45:22.349 --> 00:45:22.359 align:start position:0%
evaluation of digital and media literacy
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
curricula in schools and within academic
 
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
standards they continue digital and
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
media literacy provides children and
 
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
Educators with digital skills to
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
strengthen digital resilience or the
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
ability to recognize manage and recover
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
from online risks such as cyber bullying
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
online harassment and abuse and
 
00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
excessive social media
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
use so more good news New Hampshire's
 
00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
taking a first step here so in response
 
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
to the surgeon general's findings last
 
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
year our governor issued an executive
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
order directing a Statewide response to
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
the impact of social media on children
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and this was an
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical First Step which I
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
applaud and in seeking to create this
 
00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.750 align:start position:0%
applaud and in seeking to create this
commission

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
today we're aiming to build upon that
 
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
foundation with additional research that
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
can light the path to improving student
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
area the proposed duties of this
 
00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:20.559 align:start position:0%
commission Encompass a comprehensive
 
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
review and evaluation of media literacy
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
instruction in our schools specifically
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
the commission will review our standards
 
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
assess the availability of resources and
 
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
training for educators examine best
 
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
practices for integrating in information
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
media literacy instruction across
 
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
different subjects and grade levels
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
identify the challenges and barriers to
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
effective instruction evaluate the state
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
of our school library programs here in
 
00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
the granite state analyze those efforts
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
that these 20 other states have taken
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
and ultimately develop recommendations
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
action so while some states like
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
California New Jersey have passed very
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
ambitious and comprehensive legislation
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
in this area what is proposed today is
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
just a modest first step and a go slow
 
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
approach so we can figure out what will
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
work for us here in New Hampshire it
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
follows in the footsteps of other states
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
including Washington and Connecticut
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
that began this process in the same way
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
tackling this issue first with a
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
commitment to deep study and exploration
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
which frankly is what information
 
00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:38.599 align:start position:0%
literacy is all about taking our time
 
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
research so uh before I close I'd like
 
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:48.200 align:start position:0%
to direct your attention um to some of
 
00:47:50.109 --> 00:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
the testimony submitted online which I
 
00:47:52.109 --> 00:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
hope you'll re review in full but I just
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
want to pull out a couple quick quotes
 
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
from some of the organizations
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
supporting this Commission
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh in their testimony in support of the
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
bill the New Hampshire school library
 
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:02.680 align:start position:0%

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
thinking necessary to locate evaluate
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
and effectively use information we
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
support New Hampshire's efforts toward
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
making information and media literacy
 
00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
accessible for students across the

state and then Aaron mcneel CEO and

literacy now WR
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
people across the country are becoming
 
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
alarmed at the way children are targeted
 
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
by media messages especially in social
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
media manipulative messages and
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
information of all kinds created by
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
individuals governments and other groups
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
represent a great challenge protecting
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
our citizens from manipulation and
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
exploitation must include media literacy
 
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
education for children AI generated
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
information and messages are adding to
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
the challenge and the urgy
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
media literacy education is also key to
 
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
our Innovation and information economy
 
00:49:03.549 --> 00:49:03.559 align:start position:0%
we need a population empowered to
 
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
participate to engage creatively and to
 
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
make decisions for themselves their
 
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
families their employers and as Citizens
 
00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
media literacy is an issue on which we
 
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
have seen bipartisan agreement across
 
00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.030 align:start position:0%
have seen bipartisan agreement across
the

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
country so in closing I along with these
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
other organizations urge you to support
 
00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
this bill for the benefit of our kids
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
and for the future of the Granite State
 
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to take your questions
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh are there any
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative cordelli thank
 
00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you representative paig um
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
and I I think I would agree with you on
 
00:49:38.349 --> 00:49:38.359 align:start position:0%
a number of points including the fact
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
that there are groups targeting our
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
youth um and uh I maybe you can correct
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong but I I think that there
 
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
is a a lawsuit that has been filed
 
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
against um Facebook and a couple of
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
other social media
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
um sites and uh in terms of affecting
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
the mental health of students how does
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
it how might that play into this
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
commission's work if at
 
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
all sure um thank you for the question
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not certain of the specifics
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
of that lawsuit so I don't feel like I
 
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
can speak to that that specifically um
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
but I would certainly
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
say regardless of the outcome of that
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
suit what I would hope this commission
 
00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:29.559 align:start position:0%
would explore is how
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
to ensure that children are equipped
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
when they receive these problematic
 
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
messages to be able to decode them to
 
00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:39.079 align:start position:0%
understand what the underlying motives
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
of the messenger are and to be able to
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
you know be be more informed as they're
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
as they're trying to make their choices
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
in response to those messages thank you
 
00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
uh represent Miler thank you Mr chairman
 
00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here representing
 
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
Paige you obviously have't interest in
 
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
this topic could you for the committee
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
outline your professional background as
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
it relates to literacy books Etc sure
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so um my professional career has
 
00:51:10.589 --> 00:51:10.599 align:start position:0%
actually been in publishing but I spent
 
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
about 10 years of that career developing
 
00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
social studies curriculum materials so
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's where I began and then I moved on
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
to develop library and information
 
00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
science materials for the next 10 years
 
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
of my career so I've been rooted in in
 
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
the education uh field for 20 years of
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
my career with a focus on social studies
 
00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:31.160 align:start position:0%
and on libraries thank you further
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
for uh for taking my question um So
 
00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
within the bill within the proposed
 
00:51:45.069 --> 00:51:45.079 align:start position:0%
commission it specifically um implicates
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the um organization youth
 
00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
activism project I'm sorry not you uh
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
Media power youth yeah um so I've looked
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
at the um I've looked at them a little
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
bit to see what they're all about and
 
00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
because they're obviously would be a
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
major part of this if they're on the on
 
00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
the commission um they identify I I can
 
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
see three major core competencies to
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
what they're calling uh so uh digital
 
00:52:06.599 --> 00:52:07.670 align:start position:0%
what they're calling uh so uh digital
media

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
media
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
literacy um competency number one
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
focuses on Mental Health around
 
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
transformative social emotional learning
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh number two is identifying uh
 
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
disinformation through teaching children
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
what sources are or are not trustworthy
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
number three is digital activism which
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
they undertake through their partnership
 
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
with um Boston Children's Hospital and
 
00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
they particularly highlight their lgbtq
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
plus advocacy with Boston Children's
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
Hospital so my question based on what
 
00:52:41.549 --> 00:52:41.559 align:start position:0%
I've I've just seen here and what I've
 
00:52:45.069 --> 00:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
just said is in a divided culture how is
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
this going to help as opposed to harm
 
00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
the division that is already existing
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
about what is going on in public schools
 
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative I'd say a few things one
 
00:52:59.470 --> 00:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
is this is one member of a commission um
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
number two is I don't think that those
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
are there are a lot of different
 
00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
information literacy models out there
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
that three-prong model you've just
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
described as one organization's approach
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
although there's continuity with many
 
00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.470 align:start position:0%
although there's continuity with many
other

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
models um the executive director of that
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
organization is here and might be better
 
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
um better position to answer some of
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
those questions more
 
00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
directly um
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
I would also
 
00:53:32.109 --> 00:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
um uh I I think that's I think that's
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
all I had another point but already lost
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
it and if it occurs to me I'll bring it
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
back represent paig I do have one
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
question then represent Woodcock um
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
within our statutes
 
00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
currently we have set that we want to
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
integrate logic and rhetoric into these
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
learning areas which we identify as
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
adequacy yep and yeah I'm not going to
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
tou so much on the rhetoric which is
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
written in in in oral communication but
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
on the on the other side in in the area
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
of logic we're talking about students
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
being able to understand cause and
 
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
effect being able to discern fact from
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
nonfiction uh and and get into good
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
strong thinking skills do you believe
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
it's best to integrate what you're
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
trying to do here and provide more
 
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
professional development for our
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
teachers to know how to integrate logic
 
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
into all these subject areas seeing that
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
the social media is in social studies
 
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
and within the five areas of social
 
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
studies and all the other subjects we
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
have thank you that is such a great
 
00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
question um I would say first of all
 
00:54:44.109 --> 00:54:44.119 align:start position:0%
that's a question that this commission
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
should explore I suspect what the
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
commission will find is much in line
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
with what you're saying which is that
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
these skills need to be embedded
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
throughout the K12 curriculum and
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
throughout all subject areas um I
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
certainly know of um some schools where
 
00:55:02.109 --> 00:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
this is taught as sort of
 
00:55:05.309 --> 00:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
in a specific unit of instruction but I
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
think that that oneandone approach is
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
probably not the the best approach and
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
that we really need this instruction
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
embedded throughout um and one of the
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
specific areas of
 
00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
exploration um that this committee would
 
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
be this commission would be charged with
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
is that question of what professional
 
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
development our Educators need in order
 
00:55:27.549 --> 00:55:27.559 align:start position:0%
to be able to teach our children these
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
skills effectively so that would be one
 
00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:31.160 align:start position:0%
of the key questions we'd be
 
00:55:34.029 --> 00:55:34.039 align:start position:0%
investigating thank you if I'm if I may
 
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
I recalled what I was going to how I was
 
00:55:38.589 --> 00:55:38.599 align:start position:0%
going yes answer representative bel's
 
00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
question I just wanted to um add
 
00:55:45.029 --> 00:55:45.039 align:start position:0%
regarding Media power youth that they
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
are the only New Hampshire organization
 
00:55:50.109 --> 00:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
specifically dedicated to working on
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
this issue and they have also been
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
tapped previously by the state of New
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for collaboration for example
 
00:55:58.589 --> 00:55:58.599 align:start position:0%
when Governor suu issued this executive
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
order they were part of the team that
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
worked with with the state of New
 
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on on developing that
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum so they're already they have
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
been tapped in that way
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
before thank you very much are there
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
further questions representative dry oh
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me represent would no no you you
 
00:56:17.029 --> 00:56:17.039 align:start position:0%
on deck go
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you CH morning repres page
 
00:56:23.549 --> 00:56:23.559 align:start position:0%
to see you again um I'm looking at uh
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
the timeline yep ly uh a fast time line
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
so is it your anticipation then that if
 
00:56:32.109 --> 00:56:32.119 align:start position:0%
this bill uh comes from here and goes to
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
the floor and is pass that this study
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
commission this commission will be doing
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
their work this summer in preparation
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
for November is that a reasonable time
 
00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
frame I think I personally think it's
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable when I imagine sitting on
 
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
that commission not that I'm going to
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily be appointed to the
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
commission but um I think that I'm
 
00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
flexible on that if this committee is
 
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
interested in the idea but wants to
 
00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
discuss a different timeline I'm
 
00:56:58.829 --> 00:56:58.839 align:start position:0%
certainly open to that I I think I think
 
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
it's excellent the fact that you're
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
trying to expedite it and that you
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
brought it forward and I appreciate that
 
00:57:05.309 --> 00:57:05.319 align:start position:0%
thank you so muches thank you represent
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
dry thank you thanks for taking my
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
question I guess I'm feeling kind of
 
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
left out because if this is going to
 
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:57:15.549 --> 00:57:15.559 align:start position:0%
um proposals for legislation about
 
00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:17.720 align:start position:0%
instruction in New Hampshire schools uh
 
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
we're not on the list that gets the
 
00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.390 align:start position:0%
we're not on the list that gets the
commission

00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:57:22.829 --> 00:57:22.839 align:start position:0%
report well let's put you on there I'm
 
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
happy to do that yes put you on there by
 
00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:28.039 align:start position:0%

00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
yeah are there further questions for
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
represent paig yes represent cordial
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
being here and taking my question it's a
 
00:57:38.109 --> 00:57:38.119 align:start position:0%
quick one actually um as I was busy
 
00:57:40.109 --> 00:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
taking notes and all I heard a phrase
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
digital resilience I think you use could
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
you just explain what that means a
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
little bit more maybe I missed something
 
00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
or sure yeah that's um that was from
 
00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
that was a phrase that was used
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
specifically by the US Surgeon General
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
in their advisory report um
 
00:57:59.069 --> 00:57:59.079 align:start position:0%
my I I can't say with certainty what the
 
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
US Surgeon General intended in using
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
that phrase but my my interpretation of
 
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
that would be um you know how
 
00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
to um essentially how to move on from
 
00:58:15.789 --> 00:58:15.799 align:start position:0%
hostility that we encounter on on social
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
media day-to-day how to be able to not
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
internalize that and preserve your
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
mental health in response to this kind
 
00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
of conduct that we we probably all have
 
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
encountered on social media thank you
 
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:32.000 align:start position:0%

the establishment of this
 
00:59:14.349 --> 00:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
commission as Educators we have a
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
profound responsibility to equip our
 
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:18.440 align:start position:0%
students with the skills they need to
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
thrive in this 21st century now more

media literacy
 
00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
skills um I'd like to present three
 
00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
reasons why investing in this area is
 
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
crucial for our state's future first
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
enhancing information and media literacy
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%

like to see all the evidence that
 
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
supports this claim I have a lot of

references employers across Industries
 
01:00:38.349 --> 01:00:38.359 align:start position:0%

evaluate information and recognized bias
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
is an imperative for fostering a more

our state's identity in closing I urge
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
you to consider the profound impact that
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
a commission dedicated to studying
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
information and media literacy could
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
have on the future of our state by
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
working together across party lines we
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
can ensure that all New Hampshire
 
01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
students are equipped with the skills
 
01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
they need to thrive in an increasingly
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%

um uh you and the previous speaker both
 
01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:25.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned misinformation and
 
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
um fostering out misinformation um I
 
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
believe that there have been several um
 
01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:33.799 align:start position:0%
government um
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
initiatives um to um have um bureaus
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
agencies possibly set up to identify
 
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
misinformation just wondering you your
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
thought on government involvement in
 
01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.029 align:start position:0%
thought on government involvement in
identifying

01:02:52.029 --> 01:02:52.039 align:start position:0%
identifying
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
misinformation I I mean personally that
 
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
feels frightening to me that that could
 
01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.789 align:start position:0%
feels frightening to me that that could
possibly

01:02:59.789 --> 01:02:59.799 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
be something controlled by the
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
government and could lead to more
 
01:03:05.039 --> 01:03:06.510 align:start position:0%
government and could lead to more
political

01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
political
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
division um yeah I feel like instilling
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
these critical thinking skills in our
 
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
students across the curriculum across
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
grade levels G or
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
12 if we can do that consistently in our
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
schools hopefully by the end of that
 
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
time our students come out and they're
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
able to think critically about the
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
information that they're receiving
 
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
they're able to decipher what's
 
01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
misinformation what's biased
 
01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:39.559 align:start position:0%
information thank you very much uh
 
01:03:39.559 --> 01:03:40.950 align:start position:0%
information thank you very much uh
representative

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
question so I'm wondering if you could
 
01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
comment about what you are seeing in
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
your Plymouth State
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
students um what the range of their
 
01:03:58.029 --> 01:03:58.039 align:start position:0%
media literacy and critical thinking
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
skills are now as they present to you
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that question um so
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
to clarify I teach graduate classes so
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
most of the candidates in my program who
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
are my students are adults most of them
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
are teachers Educators right now and
 
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
they are very interested in this topic
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
which is bringing them into the library
 
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
media program at Plymouth State they
 
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
want to learn more so that they can
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
incorporate integrate this into their
 
01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
curriculum so many people are becoming
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
certified library media specialists in
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
order to do this work um a lot of my
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
colleagues at Plymouth State teaching
 
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
undergrads especially are um concerned
 
01:04:47.269 --> 01:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
because as the students as freshmen
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
arrive they have such a variety of
 
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
skills and it all depends on
 
01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
what school they went to as to how
 
01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
consistently they were taught these
 
01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
media literacy information literacy
 
01:05:08.109 --> 01:05:08.119 align:start position:0%
schools um skills and that doesn't seem
 
01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
fair it doesn't seem fair so Plymouth
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
has definitely integrated this into the
 
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
Freshman experience so that freshmen are
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
being taught how to do this on their own
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
so that everybody's kind of on an equal
 
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
playing Ground as they arrive at
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State as
 
01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
undergrads represent
 
01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.910 align:start position:0%
undergrads represent
beler

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
beler
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
quick thank you that was helpful um
 
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
could you also just comment if you have
 
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
seen a difference in or your colleagues
 
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
teaching undergrad a difference in
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
students media literacy capabilities now
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
ago yeah I'm I'm just not
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
sure I'm not sure I haven't this is my
 
01:05:59.549 --> 01:05:59.559 align:start position:0%
eighth year at Plymouth State and so I
 
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't there during those times so I
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
just can't answer that but I wish I
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
could represent beler thank you Mr chair
 
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony I
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to clear up with what seems like
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
it might be to me a a conflicting piece
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
of information um you testified when
 
01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:17.799 align:start position:0%
when you were asked about the government
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
setting up this identification of
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
disinformation you said it would be
 
01:06:24.029 --> 01:06:24.039 align:start position:0%
scary and possibly dangerous but this is
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
referring to proposing legislation that
 
01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
will affect public schools which are an
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
arm of government which would
 
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
necessitate that arm of government
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
deciding what is and is not
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
disinformation so can can you speak to
 
01:06:37.710 --> 01:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
what that seems like a conflicting
 
01:06:40.829 --> 01:06:40.839 align:start position:0%
information sure um this commission
 
01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
would not be deciding which resources
 
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
were misinformation or
 
01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.589 align:start position:0%
were misinformation or
disinformation

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
disinformation
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
or working to like name specific
 
01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.670 align:start position:0%
or working to like name specific
publication

01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
publication
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
to trust and whatnot to trust it would
 
01:06:57.359 --> 01:06:58.190 align:start position:0%
to trust and whatnot to trust it would
be

01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
teaching teachers to teach
 
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
students how to do that themselves how
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
to figure out themselves how to evaluate
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
and vet an especially online information
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
source does that make sense does that
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
answer your
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
question yes it it least partway does if
 
01:07:22.589 --> 01:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
I may just just to follow up on that so
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
because it does involve necessarily
 
01:07:26.589 --> 01:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
teaching media literacy to students at
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
Public Schools it does involve some
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
degree of what is your first principles
 
01:07:34.109 --> 01:07:34.119 align:start position:0%
and what is your sort of foundational
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
belief system when determining these
 
01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
things so does that not get into an area
 
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to become
 
01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:44.069 align:start position:0%
that's going to become
necessarily

01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
political I don't think so I mean we
 
01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
don't we're not political in our program
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
of teaching teachers you know we teach
 
01:07:55.390 --> 01:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
media literacy classes to graduate
 
01:07:57.269 --> 01:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
students we teach media literacy classes
 
01:07:57.279 --> 01:07:58.109 align:start position:0%
students we teach media literacy classes
to

01:07:58.109 --> 01:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
undergrads and we're not political we
 
01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
all come from different political
 
01:08:05.309 --> 01:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and ideologies and there's
 
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
nothing political about it I mean people
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
have their own personal politics but
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
this is about teaching critical thinking
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
and how to do that work yourself rather
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
than telling them this is the right
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
answer or this is wrong you're welcome
 
01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I do have a sort of a up on
 
01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
one of the questions I asked earlier
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
over the last year or so we've had an
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work with the provos Nate
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
from bodage from from pumma State and
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
and and of course Don Burk your
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
president um and in looking at the issue
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
of how we integrate higher order
 
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
thinking skills into the teachers
 
01:08:47.309 --> 01:08:47.319 align:start position:0%
repertoire as far as how to ask
 
01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
questions about what they're reading so
 
01:08:52.030 --> 01:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
they are starting to think on a higher
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
level and sometimes it takes a good 20
 
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
minut minutes to get to that level but
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
what are you doing right now we've asked
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
this when we were in the teacher
 
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
shortage committee asked the questions
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
what are the university and the college
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
systems doing I'm talking now of course
 
01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
you're you're a Pou state is a wonderful
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
teacher prep program so is Keen and UNH
 
01:09:14.669 --> 01:09:14.679 align:start position:0%
has a similar program what are you doing
 
01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
Within These programs right now to
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
prepare these teachers now even in The
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
Graduate level those on the you know the
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
upend of the scale and who have been
 
01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
around for a while how are you
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
integrating these higher order thinking
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
skills into their professional
 
01:09:36.269 --> 01:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
development um so their professional
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
development if it involves taking
 
01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
classes at Plymouth State University
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
then certainly we're working on that we
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
are we have embedded a lot of these
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
critical thinking skills into any
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
assessments that we do um um their
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
discussions are filled with these big
 
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
questions that really get our candidates
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
to think in complex and interconnected
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
ways that feels
 
01:10:09.719 --> 01:10:11.550 align:start position:0%
ways that feels
important

01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
um they're working together
 
01:10:14.719 --> 01:10:16.709 align:start position:0%
um they're working together
collaboratively

01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
collaboratively
 
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
to discern these different skills and to
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
understand how to um think critically
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
about these about some of these
 
01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.990 align:start position:0%
about these about some of these
topics

01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
topics
 
01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm not sure if I answered your
 
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
question so you're asking specifically
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
how we're teaching our graduate students
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
or you're asking me specifically how I'm
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
teaching my graduate students to think
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
critically that's what you're asking
 
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
yeah it's you know I was a school
 
01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
administrator and I used to send a
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
number of teachers to work with Dr
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
ranuli down in Yukon dealing with gifted
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
education yeah and of course there you
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
have to get up to those levels do and
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
and so a lot of that instruction down in
 
01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
Yukon was how to ask the
 
01:11:06.270 --> 01:11:06.280 align:start position:0%
questions and I'm I'm just curious to
 
01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
know whether we're doing that in the
 
01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
three teacher prep programs we have in
 
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
this state and you're you're in one of
 
01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State I am I am and so we're
 
01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
definitely doing that in graduate level
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
we are teaching people inquiry skills
 
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
we're teaching them to ask these complex
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
questions to think deep ly about topics
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
we're not talking superficial you know
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not teaching uh future Librarians
 
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
the Dewey Decimal System right we're
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
teaching them some really well be
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't they know that too
 
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
right yeah it would but that's not the
 
01:11:42.669 --> 01:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
instruction but like why are we using
 
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
the Dey Decimal System how does that
 
01:11:48.189 --> 01:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
help people keep information organized
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thanks
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you and Hi
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
how are you good uh please excuse me if
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
this was addressed already I was
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
testifying another committee but I'm
 
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
looking at the membership of this
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
commission and it is asking from the New
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school library media
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
Association someone from an urban school
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
and a rural school and I am unaware of
 
01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
where these definitions are what would
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
be considered Urban and what is rural is
 
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
that defined somewhere else in statute
 
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps what yeah could David page come
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
okay so I'd be very open to adding a
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
definition there I'm also open to
 
01:12:36.629 --> 01:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
discussing the composition of the
 
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
commission with the members of this
 
01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
committee if folks think that we need to
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
look at that um so if we need
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
definitions for rural and urban there
 
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with that I'll tell you the
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
underlying reason for doing that is in a
 
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
lot of dis this discussion began
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
trying to look toward What legislation
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
might be right for New Hampshire and
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
what we quickly um discovered as a lot
 
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
of us were talking through
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
this is that we have some real divides
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of what would be realistic for
 
01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.629 align:start position:0%
in terms of what would be realistic for
different

01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:13:15.149 --> 01:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
districts based on uh you know we had I
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
talked with one school librarian who was
 
01:13:20.189 --> 01:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
doing the most amazing work in her
 
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
District where she had you know
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
these amazing results you know she did
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
pre-assessments of the kids skills and
 
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
it was really shocking and did all this
 
01:13:33.629 --> 01:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
incredible work and on the other end the
 
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
results are just incredible right in
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
this one district and it's something
 
01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
that you know it makes you start
 
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
salivating because you're like oh we
 
01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
need to scale this across you know this
 
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
is what we need but then you know you
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
have somebody in an elementary school
 
01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
library on the same call in a different
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
District who raises her hand and says
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
that's all great for you I don't have a
 
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
computer in my library right so we have
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
these this really important need as
 
01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
we're discussing what the right solution
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
might be for New Hampshire that we get
 
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
these perspectives from different grade
 
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
levels that we'll need to be figuring
 
01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
out how we integrate this instruction in
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
the curriculum and also that rural urban
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
divide in the state so that's where that
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
comes from but I'm very open to
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
discussing with the committee if we want
 
01:14:24.189 --> 01:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
to um either look at the composition
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
itself more closely and discuss what
 
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
might work or also if we need stronger
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
definitions there I appreciate and if I
 
01:14:32.189 --> 01:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
may have a followup yes uh thank you
 
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative Paige regarding the
 
01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
composition the next section spells out
 
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
the media power Youth and I'm always a
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
little bit hesitant to put an
 
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
organization name and statute so I guess
 
01:14:46.629 --> 01:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
my question is why this organization was
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
picked as opposed to perhaps another
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
organization sure uh this came up
 
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
briefly earlier in response to question
 
01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
from representative beler but it's the
 
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
only New Hampshire organization that
 
01:14:59.629 --> 01:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
focuses on this specific area and that's
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
the reason if there were 20 of them then
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
I probably wouldn't name them um but
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
they are the organization the local
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
organization that is doing this work and
 
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
has worked on you know Governor's Sun's
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
prior initiative in this area and so
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
there's an established there's
 
01:15:17.709 --> 01:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
continuity there thank you thank you
 
01:15:19.629 --> 01:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
thank you now we have several more cards
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
here and we do have to get out to lunch
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
and we have the governor speak at 1:00
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much thank you and I'd
 
01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
Ballard good morning good
 
01:15:46.350 --> 01:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
morning um my name is Susan D Ballard

grateful for the opportunity to speak to
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
you today about my Earnest support for
 
01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1087 establishing a
 
01:15:58.830 --> 01:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
commission to study information literacy
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
and media literacy instruction in public
 
01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
schools I am a retired New Hampshire
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
school district director of library
 
01:16:09.149 --> 01:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
media and technology and a past
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
president of the American Association of
 
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
school librarians most recently I was
 
01:16:16.629 --> 01:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
part of a national project funded by The
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
Institute of Museum and Library Services
 
01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
through the Laura Bush 21st century
 
01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:24.280 align:start position:0%
librarian grant program I served as an
 
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
interviewer and spoke with school
 
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
administrators from across the country
 
01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
in discussing the impact of school
 
01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
librarians on student learning I can
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
assure you that this subject is top of
 
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
Mind among them like so many in New
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these School leaders are
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
worried that Learners are not developing
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
the foundational skills and competencies
 
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
needed to engage with and evaluate
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
information resources in an increasingly
 
01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
complex and dynamic global
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
environment the overarching concern is
 
01:17:01.229 --> 01:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
that many of our young people are unable
 
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
to distinguish fact from fiction do not
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
comprehend the difference between points
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
of view and opinion versus accepted
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge or recognize misinformation
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
disinformation and in the worst case
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
scenario Mal information designed to
 
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
harm them as well as impact societal
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
interests this all represents a
 
01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
compelling imperative to ensure that we
 
01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
prepare students for lifelong learning
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
by equipping them with the ability to
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
understand the research process and to
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
recognize when there is a need for
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
information problem solving and then to
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
locate assess and use information and
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
resources ethically I'm confident that
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
the establishment of this commission
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
will help to identify strategies that
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
will pay dividends for our learning
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
communities and contribute to ensuring
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
that our students are not only
 
01:17:59.550 --> 01:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
information and media literate but also
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
productive citizens and involved and
 
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
informed participants in the
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
preservation of democracy I urge you to
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
move forward with creating the
 
01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
commission and I thank you for your time
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
and your thoughtful consideration of
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you very much are there
 
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee represent
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
belard thank you and thank you for being
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
here I just had I had one question
 
01:18:24.629 --> 01:18:24.639 align:start position:0%
because I'm not L myself 100% clear on
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
the distinction you brought up between
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
what represents a opinion versus
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
accepted knowledge so could you provide
 
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
that distinction for me what what is
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
meant um I would identify accepted
 
01:18:38.669 --> 01:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
knowledge as as um things like we know
 
01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
that the Earth revolves on an annual
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
cycle um that's accepted knowledge
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
versus someone who says no we're
 
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
standing still
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
um people are entitled to their opinion
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
but you're years of of research science
 
01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.510 align:start position:0%
but you're years of of research science
um

01:18:58.510 --> 01:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:01.709 --> 01:19:01.719 align:start position:0%
investigation have provided us with an
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
accepted base of knowledge that I think
 
01:19:09.149 --> 01:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
most people would um would uh concur
 
01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
thank you does that make sense thank you
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
very much further questions from the
 
01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
committee thank you thank you do you

teaches media literacy skills Media
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
power youth every day I meet young
 
01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
people who feel trapped in media and
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
Tech ecosystem that simultaneously
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
promises access to opportunity and at
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
the same time threatens their safety and
 
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
wellbeing we owe it to the children of
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to teach them the skills
 
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
they need to navigate these tools and
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
prepare them for life after graduation
 
01:20:27.070 --> 01:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
my comments today reflect my discussions
 
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
with our youth Advisory Board local
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
Educators and the researchers we've
 
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
worked with to develop our media
 
01:20:35.149 --> 01:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
education programs much of the
 
01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
information children encounter each day
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
is not from a book information is coming
 
01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
from students from all directions in a
 
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
variety of formats for example they are
 
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
learning about space exploration on a
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
NASA live stream and getting homework
 
01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
help from peers on YouTube they are
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
learning about history through virtual
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
reality experiences and reading the news
 
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
on Tik Tok if we value resourcefulness
 
01:20:59.629 --> 01:20:59.639 align:start position:0%
and curiosity in learning we need to
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
prepare our students for these journeys
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
of Discovery with the skills they to
 
01:21:05.229 --> 01:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
assess what they
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
find the information most students are
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
interacting with is much more complex
 
01:21:11.709 --> 01:21:11.719 align:start position:0%
than just the written word the texts our
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
youth are confronted with feature
 
01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
movement images and sound woven together
 
01:21:18.189 --> 01:21:18.199 align:start position:0%
media and information literacy teaches
 
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
the critical thinking skills that enable
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
students to understand how each of these
 
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
individual elements contribute to a
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
message and to consider the source of
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
the information when deciding what is
 
01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
and is not credible media literacy is
 
01:21:32.669 --> 01:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
not about telling students what to think
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
it is about helping them to build a
 
01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
toolkit of the literacy skills they need
 
01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
to read the complex information they
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
encounter every
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
day it teaches students to ask
 
01:21:44.669 --> 01:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate questions of their Heroes I
 
01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
might love Tom Brady but should I follow
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
his advice about investing in crypto we
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
all saw how that turned
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
out the rapid development and
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
integration of artificial intelligence
 
01:21:57.790 --> 01:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
into our communication tools and Data
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
Systems makes it even more important
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
that we teach our kids how to engage
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
with information these Technologies make
 
01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
it cheap and easy for almost anyone to
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
create fake information including photos
 
01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
conversational speech and even someone's
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
voice and likeness I fully support this
 
01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
bill HP n87 to create a commission to
 
01:22:17.709 --> 01:22:17.719 align:start position:0%
study information and media literacy
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
instruction in public schools media
 
01:22:21.149 --> 01:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
literacy is by its nature
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary and is often embedded
 
01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
in other subjects including stem health
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
and language arts the benefit of this
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
commission is that we'll bring together
 
01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
a variety of perspectives and help us
 
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
learn from others it will help us
 
01:22:34.110 --> 01:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
understand what education efforts are
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
already happening in New Hampshire and
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
build on them by uncovering best
 
01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
practices and teaching um media and
 
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
information literacy that can be shared
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
across Community as representative page
 
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
noted 20 states are already implementing
 
01:22:49.229 --> 01:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
media literacy initiatives in education
 
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
and if we don't consider this issue we
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
risk leaving New Hampshire's youth
 
01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.310 align:start position:0%
risk leaving New Hampshire's youth
behind

01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
behind
 
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm happy to take any
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much we enjoy
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
your Tom Brady comment the six time
 
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
Super Bowl
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
champions um are there any questions
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
from the committee rep s belshire thank
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I think you would be better
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
to answer this than rep page um because
 
01:23:11.629 --> 01:23:11.639 align:start position:0%
you this is your organization so I've
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
perued the website a little bit um and
 
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
I've it really identifies heavily a
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
number of different pages on advocacy
 
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
and activism and digital activism uh I
 
01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
know one particular page talks about
 
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus advocacy your association
 
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
with Boston Children's Hospital but it's
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
not just your organization just I mean
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
even the plth State website specifically
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
identifies social change to be one of
 
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
the goals of this program so can you
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit about how and why we
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
would go about training students to be
 
01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:42.750 align:start position:0%
would go about training students to be
social

01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
social
 
01:23:45.870 --> 01:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
activists um so we have several
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
different types of programming some of
 
01:23:51.149 --> 01:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
it is in schools in terms of teaching um
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
critical thinking and that's corre ulum
 
01:23:55.390 --> 01:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
but we also work in part with other
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
types of organizations after school or
 
01:24:00.189 --> 01:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
youth leadership groups that are not
 
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily in schools um so I just want
 
01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
to clarify that um element when we talk
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
about um being active in issues that we
 
01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
care about there is in um education
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
project based learning and the theory of
 
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
active involvement and so when students
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
are actively working on a project or
 
01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
creating something and they have to make
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
creative decisions about what
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
information to include and not include
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
that's when the real learning happens
 
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
and so when we talk about these projects
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
it's often a particular topic maybe
 
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
selected by an organization or selected
 
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
by a group of students on something that
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
they want to learn more about when we
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
explore and we act as coaches for them
 
01:24:47.229 --> 01:24:47.239 align:start position:0%
to engage in necessarily in that topic
 
01:24:49.629 --> 01:24:49.639 align:start position:0%
so um to help
 
01:24:54.109 --> 01:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
them um Talk about issues in a way that
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
brings people together and to be
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
thinking through things like my audience
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
how am I building support for ideas
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
those types of skills but it's that's a
 
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
subset of what we do usually at the
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
request of a specific organization or
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
individuals thank you very much
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald thank you Mr chair
 
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here as well as
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
for what you have been doing across the
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
state my question is somewhat along the
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
same lines what I opposed previously
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
about spelling out Media power youth in
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
statute do you have any suggestions on
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
possible amending language on how you
 
01:25:30.109 --> 01:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
could describe your organization without
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
stating the name to leave it open-ended
 
01:25:35.109 --> 01:25:35.119 align:start position:0%
for future organizations that may arise
 
01:25:38.510 --> 01:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
um I I think we we we it for an
 
01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
organization that would have expertise
 
01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
in media literacy um and that works um
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
specifically with uh young people those
 
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
would be ingredients that I think are um
 
01:25:53.950 --> 01:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
would be important in any um
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
organization uh Media power youth was
 
01:25:59.310 --> 01:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
actually formed as part of a community
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
health clinic and so we always look at
 
01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
health and well-being as part of how we
 
01:26:07.229 --> 01:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
approach our work um so I think that's
 
01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
something that I would need to think a
 
01:26:10.990 --> 01:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more about how exactly to
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
describe it um but we have um worked
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
with many state agencies over the last
 
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:21.639 align:start position:0%
20 plus years on initiatives and um are
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
looking forward to help in any way that
 
01:26:25.629 --> 01:26:25.639 align:start position:0%
we can thank you thank you very much
 
01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee not
 
01:26:29.149 --> 01:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
see any more hands thank you very much
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
for coming today and we have no more
 
01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
pink cards on this one so we're going to
 
01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on
 
01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
1087 and open up the hearing on our next
 
01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:41.360 align:start position:0%

District
 
01:27:24.669 --> 01:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
um I am here stepping in for
 
01:27:26.669 --> 01:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
representative Horan who was not able to
 
01:27:29.629 --> 01:27:29.639 align:start position:0%
be here to introduce his bill uh this is
 
01:27:32.109 --> 01:27:32.119 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1418 relative to the use of
 
01:27:33.870 --> 01:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
Education Freedom account funds to
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
purchase school
 
01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
uniforms uh and the bill analysis it the
 
01:27:41.310 --> 01:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
bill prohibits the use of EFA funds to
 
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
purchase school
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
uniforms and I will efficiently read
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
through representative Horgan's
 
01:27:51.550 --> 01:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
remarks um hb1 1418 deletes one line
 
01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
from RS a 194
 
01:27:58.109 --> 01:27:58.119 align:start position:0%
F2 colon Roman numeral Tu bullet point H
 
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
which specifies school uniforms as one
 
01:28:01.629 --> 01:28:01.639 align:start position:0%
of the items which can be bought with
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
so-called EFA vouchers the main
 
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
rationale behind this bill is that it is
 
01:28:07.629 --> 01:28:07.639 align:start position:0%
unfair to use taxpayer funds to
 
01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
subsidize school uniforms when other
 
01:28:11.709 --> 01:28:11.719 align:start position:0%
school related clothing expenses are
 
01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
excluded from the EFA program every
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
school has a dress code of some sort but
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
when it comes to meeting the
 
01:28:19.229 --> 01:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
requirements of those dress codes
 
01:28:20.669 --> 01:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
families are on their own unless they
 
01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
send their children to a very specific
 
01:28:24.030 --> 01:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
specific type of school that would be
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
religious schools such as Catholic
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
parochial schools and christiany as well
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
as non-religious private schools a
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
secondary rationale that is that it is
 
01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
unfair to exclude non-fa families from
 
01:28:38.550 --> 01:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
this benefit there are a few chartered
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
public schools which require uniforms
 
01:28:42.669 --> 01:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
although to the best of my knowledge no
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
regular public schools here in New
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire require them as I've already
 
01:28:48.510 --> 01:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
said all schools have a dress code of
 
01:28:51.550 --> 01:28:51.560 align:start position:0%
some sort neither the EFA program or the
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
educ tax credit program provide any
 
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
assistance of any sort to public school
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
families it is hard to tell exactly how
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
much taxpayer money is being spent on
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
school uniforms but it is a significant
 
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:06.280 align:start position:0%
though admittedly not huge amount
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
halfway through the 2223 school year
 
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
education commissioner Frank adbl
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
compiled a rather vague report entitled
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
quote EFA spending by spending category
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
unquote a spending category called
 
01:29:23.109 --> 01:29:23.119 align:start position:0%
simply school uniforms amounted to to
 
01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
$3,059 spread over 282 students that
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
amounts to 66% of the overall
 
01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:32.910 align:start position:0%
amounts to 66% of the overall
4,568

01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
4,568
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
620 which was spent over that applicable
 
01:29:38.189 --> 01:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
time period apparently the second half
 
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
of calendar year
 
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:43.400 align:start position:0%
22 this divides out to $106 per covered
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
student there were four other spending
 
01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
categories whose titles included the
 
01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
phrase school uniforms alongside other
 
01:29:52.990 --> 01:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
things a second report covering the same
 
01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
period entitled EFA by vendor shows that
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
the high-end online clothing store L end
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
received $
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
7,459 in EFA spending spread over 48
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
students that averages out to
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
$155.4 cents per covered student judging
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
by what I have seen on lanen website
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
their school uniform offerings are
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
comparable to their regular merchandise
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
I.E high quality but not
 
01:30:21.109 --> 01:30:21.119 align:start position:0%
inexpensive the overall cost of the EFA
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
Voucher Program has continually
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
increased by a massive amount since 202
 
01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
2022 with no end in sight and presumably
 
01:30:31.550 --> 01:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
school uniform spending has gone up
 
01:30:33.149 --> 01:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
along with all the other spending
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
categories I'm not necessarily opposed
 
01:30:38.109 --> 01:30:38.119 align:start position:0%
to school uniforms per se but I do not
 
01:30:39.790 --> 01:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
think they should be subsidized by the
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers I know there are many families
 
01:30:43.870 --> 01:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
who can't afford uniforms but their
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
needs can be met by private charity or
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
by the schools themselves one way to
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
meet those needs would be to privately
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
subsidize purchases and gifts of new or
 
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
used uniforms and another way would be
 
01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
to set up hy- down programs for children
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
who lack older
 
01:31:01.229 --> 01:31:01.239 align:start position:0%
siblings and that is uh representative
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
Horgan's testimony on his bill hp1 1418
 
01:31:05.679 --> 01:31:07.310 align:start position:0%
Horgan's testimony on his bill hp1 1418
thank

01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
you well see you're not taking question
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
because you're not represented Horgan
 
01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
correct so with that we're going I have
 
01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
no other pink cards on this so we're
 
01:31:19.629 --> 01:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
do we have any kind of a CO prior to
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
this yeah 12 o00 oh the Democrats too
 
01:31:39.310 --> 01:31:39.320 align:start position:0%

Lun yeah spent a lot of money at L
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
that's for sure on those
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
un where is it in rep yeah I'm going to
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%

yeah
 
01:32:01.629 --> 01:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.639 --> 01:32:06.910 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:20.679 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
expensive
