00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately is paid for by rate payers
 
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
and since our job is to represent the
 
00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
interests of residential ratepayers
 
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
we take that seriously and I don't
 
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily think there's any
 
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
distinction in my mind between the
 
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
so the the handouts that I gave you are
 
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
going to be inscrutable unless I explain
 
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
them and I'd be happy to do that if
 
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:38.700 --> 00:01:04.969 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
all right if you'd like to start with
 
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 align:start position:0%
you presentation thank you
 
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
so we're asking the general court to add
 
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
one additional human being to our staff
 
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 align:start position:0%
making us an agency of six because I
 
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
would like to join my counterparts from
 
00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 align:start position:0%
the rest of New England and devote at
 
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
least one person full time to Regional
 
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
electric matters the electricity Grid in
 
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
New England meaning wholesale
 
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
electricity markets and the bulk power
 
00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 align:start position:0%
transmission system are operated and
 
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
overseen by a non-profit organization
 
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
called ISO New England which is subject
 
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
to Federal not State regulation and
 
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 align:start position:0%
because we have restructured our
 
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
electric industry and opened electricity
 
00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
to competition at wholesale and Retail
 
00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
this is where I would suggest much if
 
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
not most of the action is with respect
 
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
to electricity rates and electricity
 
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
regulation in New England and it is very
 
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
difficult and Arcane stuff uh ISO New
 
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
England is governed by two different
 
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
bodies one is a board of directors it's
 
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 align:start position:0%
a garden variety non-profit that has a
 
00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 align:start position:0%
board and there is also a stakeholder
 
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board and I put the word
 
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
advisory in air quotes because it is far
 
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
more than advisory that board is called
 
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
that body is called knee pool and it
 
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
functions kind of like a big legislature
 
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
and um my office is actually a voting
 
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 align:start position:0%
member of knee pool and if you look at
 
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
the first the one page handout I gave
 
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
you that's just a schedule that I got
 
00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 align:start position:0%
from ISO New England of all of the Nepal
 
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
committee meetings that one would have
 
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
to attend over the course of any of
 
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
those three months listed there in order
 
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
to be up to speed and uh diligently
 
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
exercising our vote in Nepal in March I
 
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
think there are eight days and these
 
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
tend to be either all half day or full
 
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
day meetings and what's discussed at
 
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
those meetings is very detailed
 
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
technical stuff that has to do with
 
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
economics and the details of how
 
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 align:start position:0%
electricity actually works at wholesale
 
00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
the other document I gave you
 
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
is a memorandum from the New England
 
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
states committee on electricity Nesco
 
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
Nesco is the organization that
 
00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 align:start position:0%
represents the six New England states as
 
00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
sovereigns each state has a Nesco
 
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
manager our state's Nesco manager is
 
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
sitting behind me he's the commissioner
 
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
of energy Mr shacoin and what he I think
 
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
would readily confirm is that Nesco and
 
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
my office
 
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
complement each other I have the vote in
 
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 align:start position:0%
Nepal I'm a voting member of Nepal Nesco
 
00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
appears Before ice of New England and
 
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
participates in Nesco meetings without a
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
vote but as the representative of the
 
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
states as sovereigns and the reason I
 
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 align:start position:0%
copy this particular Memo from Nesco for
 
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
you is really because I wanted you to
 
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
look at a couple of lines that begin at
 
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
the very bottom of page two and continue
 
00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 align:start position:0%
on to page three and there you see
 
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
references to over 2 over 2.787 billion
 
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 align:start position:0%
dollars of asset condition projects
 
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.610 align:start position:0%
dollars of asset condition projects
plus

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 align:start position:0%
plus
 
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
3.255 billion more of such projects that
 
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
are proposed and if you read through
 
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
that memo and interpret it a little less
 
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.290 align:start position:0%
that memo and interpret it a little less
uh

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 align:start position:0%
how can I say this if if you read
 
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
between the lines of this memo and
 
00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 align:start position:0%
actually see it for what it is what
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
you'll discover is that all of those
 
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
expenditures something like
 
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
six billion dollars in transmission
 
00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
costs over the last few years are
 
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
essentially going unscrutinized by
 
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.450 align:start position:0%
essentially going unscrutinized by
anybody

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
and that is just one example of what is
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
happening at the regional and federal
 
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
level that has direct and serious
 
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
impacts on rate payers that nobody is
 
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
looking at and I want to send somebody
 
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
to all these meetings of Nepal and ISO
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
New England so that I feel more
 
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
confident that the interests of this
 
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
state's rate payers are being protected
 
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 align:start position:0%
and just for reference if you take that
 
00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 align:start position:0%
six billion dollars and divide 6 billion
 
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
by 10 which is still a big sum of money
 
00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 align:start position:0%
that's roughly New Hampshire's
 
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 align:start position:0%
um so I think that's the gist of what
 
00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 align:start position:0%
I'm asking to do and it's the first time
 
00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 align:start position:0%
I've asked either the governor or the
 
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
general court to grow the office of the
 
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate and I think in the
 
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 align:start position:0%
circumstances it's a it's a reasonably
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
Modest Proposal
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
questions represent Maguire
 
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so this um page
 
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
you gave us with with these meetings the
 
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
nine and March and so on
 
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
um which of those meetings would be
 
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 align:start position:0%
attended now
 
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
um without this extra person well right
 
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
now I rely on an outside consultant to
 
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
attend those meetings for me I share the
 
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
that Consulting team with lots of other
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
clients uh two of which are other rate
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
payer advocates in the region my
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
counterpart in Connecticut and Maine and
 
00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 align:start position:0%
others that have interests that diverge
 
00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
from ours frankly and I would feel more
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
confident and comfortable uh with my own
 
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
staff person there
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
um there is enough going on in those
 
00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 align:start position:0%
meetings so that even if I sent a
 
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
full-time person in to engage with all
 
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
of this and still relied on those
 
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
Consultants there would still be aspects
 
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
of this that I couldn't cover as well as
 
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
I would like to where's the consultant
 
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
in your budget uh I didn't bring my
 
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
budget document with me but it is in the
 
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.050 align:start position:0%
budget document with me but it is in the
Consulting

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.060 align:start position:0%
Consulting
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.610 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.290 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.029 align:start position:0%
right
so

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:24.979 align:start position:0%
okay so this is only
 
00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:28.979 align:start position:0%
so first of all this year last year you
 
00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:33.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh we have two live Consulting contracts
 
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
and we are continuing to spend money on
 
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.650 align:start position:0%
and we are continuing to spend money on
them

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh but they were both uh I'm not an
 
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
expert on how the budget actually works
 
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:49.460 align:start position:0%
technically those contracts were both
 
00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:54.419 align:start position:0%
approved in the previous year 2021 and
 
00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 align:start position:0%
so I think that might if it says there
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
that we didn't spend any money last year
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
yeah further so so that line which was
 
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
Zero last year is scheduled to be 25 000
 
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
this year and then 50 000 each of the
 
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
next two years
 
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
um that's less than what a new person
 
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
would cost yes
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
yes because my contention or my
 
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
hypothesis I guess is that there is lots
 
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
of work that is not being done by
 
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.930 align:start position:0%
of work that is not being done by
anybody

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
meaning representing the interests of
 
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:36.419 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rate bears at the regional
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
and federal level
 
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
ideally we would also be participating
 
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
in proceedings before the Federal Energy
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission which is the body
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so would you be willing to have
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
this new person but not the Consultants
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
or not I would be willing to do whatever
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
you tell me you decide that the general
 
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
court is going to do but I would humbly
 
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
ask that you not do that we have uh
 
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.070 align:start position:0%
ask that you not do that we have uh
um

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
we have money in our Consulting and
 
00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
litigation lines in our budget to help
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
us with outside experts because I need
 
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
outside experts to present expert
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
testimony at the Public Utilities
 
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
Commission and I have two in-house
 
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
analysts to do that in my budget but I
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
am unable to fill those positions at
 
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
present and if I continue to not be able
 
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
to fill them I do intend to rely on
 
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:37.740 align:start position:0%
outside Consultants to provide me with
 
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
that help
 
00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:43.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
represents Sweeney followed by
 
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
camberells thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
you for being here for taking questions
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
my first question I have for you
 
00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
take the total sum of the budget you've
 
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
requested what's the impact on the
 
00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:57.899 align:start position:0%
ratepayer to fund it if you were to put
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
it into cents or dollars of the year for
 
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.509 align:start position:0%
it into cents or dollars of the year for
average

00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:02.519 align:start position:0%
average
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
I think that our proposed budget is
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
about a million dollars a year in the
 
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
upcoming biennium and if you uh it's it
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
is a tiny tiny tiny ratepayer impact I
 
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
mean uh pennies a month something like
 
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
that what follow-up you had mentioned
 
00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:25.019 align:start position:0%
this new position uh taking votes in the
 
00:10:27.769 --> 00:10:27.779 align:start position:0%
New England ISO group
 
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
what informs their vote on the committee
 
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
are they bound to policies that we've
 
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
adopted as a legislature the energy the
 
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
10-year energy plan what informs how
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
they vote as an individual member of the
 
00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:44.519 align:start position:0%
group I I would say it's both of those
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
things uh there is a provision in our
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
enabling statute that also appears in
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
the I believe it's the enabling statute
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
of the puc and maybe even the department
 
00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
of energy that obliges us to go before
 
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
these Federal bodies and make sure that
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
the interests of New Hampshire's rate
 
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
payers are not unfairly subsidizing or
 
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
paying for the public policy uh
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
initiatives of other states it won't
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
surprise you I assume to know that the
 
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
energy related public policy of the rest
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
of New England differs pretty markedly
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
from that of New Hampshire and our job
 
00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:26.339 align:start position:0%
is to defend the public policy interests
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and its rate payers and
 
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:32.220 align:start position:0%
so yes I am familiar with the 10-year
 
00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:35.339 align:start position:0%
energy strategy and I do think that it
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
is part of my responsibility to advance
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
that strategy regionally and federally
 
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
and so we work in con officer with the
 
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and its Nesco
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
manager because although I'm independent
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
of the Department of energy I think the
 
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
interests of the state and its rate
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
payers are well served if we maintain
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.210 --> 00:11:59.220 align:start position:0%
representative kimberles thank you Mr
 
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.350 align:start position:0%
representative kimberles thank you Mr
chair

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
um as you said this is a very
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
complicated I haven't been on science
 
00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:05.220 align:start position:0%
and technology and I understand the comp
 
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
how complicated uh this whole thing is
 
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh how come if we fund this how
 
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
confident are you that you can hire the
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate individual that will have
 
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
the knowledge to deal with this that's
 
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
an excellent question uh I labored over
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
this because uh you know there are
 
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
different ways of uh
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
creating new positions and I created
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
this new position as an attorney for
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
position I know that uh the state is
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
going through this big reclassification
 
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
effort so that attorney four will vanish
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
into Oblivion but I decided that my best
 
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
chance at successfully recruiting for
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
this job would be by having that job be
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
an attorney and I've seen I I I've been
 
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
to Nepal meetings and I've participated
 
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
in these forums personally and I think
 
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
the people who are the most effective
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
are the ones who are trained by lawyers
 
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
they can talk to the economists and it's
 
00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
a little harder to do it the other way
 
00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
and I've I've had more success
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
recruiting lawyers than analysts and for
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
whatever reason it might be because I'm
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
a lawyer and I can persuade other
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
lawyers that I'm just great to work for
 
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate representative
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
cambrell's being on this division
 
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.430 align:start position:0%
cambrell's being on this division
because

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
having the knowledge of science and
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
technology is I think pretty important
 
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
especially after listening to the debate
 
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
yesterday on all the other Science and
 
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
Technology bills but representative
 
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.310 align:start position:0%
Technology bills but representative
people

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
hi uh welcome back um would you would
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
you argue that it is to the rate payers
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
great benefit to have an individual as a
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
full participant in these Regional
 
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.230 align:start position:0%
full participant in these Regional
discussions

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
um so that the smaller investment for
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
this attorney could pay benefits for our
 
00:13:54.889 --> 00:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
rate payers in the long run absolutely
 
00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
that would be the guiding premise of the
 
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
whole thing and as I said at the
 
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
beginning every single one of my
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
counterparts in the region has at least
 
00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
one full-time person dedicated to this
 
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
work I believe my counterparted
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has has several and I
 
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:14.220 align:start position:0%
admire their work but the public policy
 
00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:17.579 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts is not identical at all
 
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
so without having a person there full
 
00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019 align:start position:0%
time for us uh
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
we could be affected in a negative way
 
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:36.620 align:start position:0%
because of all these other
 
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
countervailing issues and we're not
 
00:14:41.449 --> 00:14:41.459 align:start position:0%
sitting at the table to present our own
 
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
yes that's exactly the point I'm making
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
and that's really the reason I gave you
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
that Nesco memo like it is my testimony
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
that there is six billion dollars of
 
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
past and future transmission costs that
 
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
are going into rates and being paid for
 
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
by every electric rate payer in New
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
England that nobody at any level has
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
scrutinized these are utilities that are
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
spending billions of dollars and nobody
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
is looking over their shoulders and
 
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler followed by
 
00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:16.139 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you as an example of one of the
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
things that sometimes come to light
 
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
several years ago when the price of oil
 
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
was going up and we were getting more of
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
a break from
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
Hydro Electric
 
00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:33.380 align:start position:0%
we discovered that ISO New England was
 
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
assigning all the breaks
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
and hydroelectric from New Hampshire to
 
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.670 align:start position:0%
and hydroelectric from New Hampshire to
Connecticut

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
Connecticut
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
even though most of the hydroelectric
 
00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
was really coming from the Connecticut
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
River although it's the Connecticut
 
00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
River with most the hydroelectric was
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
produced in New Hampshire
 
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
and so here was ISO New England giving
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
them the credit so our oil levels went
 
00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
up higher and we weren't getting credit
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
for the hydro that's the kind of thing
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
that goes on if we're not watching so
 
00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:03.710 align:start position:0%
that goes on if we're not watching so
anyway

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
you need somebody there to make sure
 
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:07.019 align:start position:0%
this doesn't happen
 
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:08.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:10.019 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire
 
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so the other big
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
increase in your budget is on page 359
 
00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:19.100 align:start position:0%
litigation which is going up 67 percent
 
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
are we planning to start suing somebody
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
that we're not suing now uh no this
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
comes up I think any time our budget or
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
the department of Energy's budget comes
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
up for some reason the the word
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
litigation appears in the budget when it
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
really means uh administrative
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
litigation in front of the Public
 
00:16:39.889 --> 00:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission
 
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
so why are those expenses jumping this
 
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
much I I I asked to increase that budget
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
as a kind of an insurance policy because
 
00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:52.019 align:start position:0%
I can't seem to fill my two analyst
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
positions and I either need outside or
 
00:16:57.769 --> 00:16:57.779 align:start position:0%
inside analysts to present expert
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
and and I can't I'm not allowed to
 
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
transfer the money that is allocated to
 
00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
those two staff positions into my
 
00:17:11.929 --> 00:17:11.939 align:start position:0%
consulting or litigation budgets uh so I
 
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
kind of have to make provision for both
 
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.270 align:start position:0%
kind of have to make provision for both
sure

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
sorry so I don't see that you're missing
 
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
anybody in the sense that if I look
 
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
between 2023 salary lines and 2022
 
00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.890 align:start position:0%
between 2023 salary lines and 2022
actuals

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
actuals
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
there's essentially no difference
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
the two positions that I'm talking about
 
00:17:35.049 --> 00:17:35.059 align:start position:0%
became vacant in
 
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
September of last year and so we did pay
 
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
those two people through September and
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
they were uh I believe they were both
 
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
fully occupied in the previous year so
 
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
that's why they're not they're not
 
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
zeroed out either in the current year or
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
this is just a comment but it seems like
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
we're sort of double counting here right
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
we've got money for people and money for
 
00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:13.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
that is unabashedly true I don't know
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
how else to do that in a way that will
 
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
allow me to continue to be effective I
 
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
can assure you that I'm not going to
 
00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:27.539 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not going to do the same thing
 
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
twice I'm only going to use either
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
analysts or Consultants
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
is this a footnote type thing or I don't
 
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.710 align:start position:0%
is this a footnote type thing or I don't
know

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
um Melissa Mr Hoffman should we put a
 
00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:45.539 align:start position:0%
footnote there's representative McGuire
 
00:18:45.539 --> 00:18:47.630 align:start position:0%
footnote there's representative McGuire
suggested

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
what would you like the footnote to say
 
00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
well I'm thinking suppose we we remove
 
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
the increase in this line but allow them
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
to transfer
 
00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
or maybe some of the increase in that
 
00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
line but allow them to transfer some
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
salary into
 
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.870 align:start position:0%
salary into
consultant

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
consultant
 
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
if there's an unfunded position you know
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
I mean an unoccupied position you know
 
00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:12.539 align:start position:0%
something like that similar to the
 
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections language that
 
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
permits them to use salary benefit money
 
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
for other purposes yeah they use it for
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
overtime but we could write something if
 
00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:24.419 align:start position:0%
yeah something like that but then you
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
know we could maybe save
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
um 75 000 a year or something like that
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin has a question
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Chan thank you for taking
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:51.299 align:start position:0%
uh so you anticipate there's going to be
 
00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:54.539 align:start position:0%
some unsp unspent funds at the end of
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
the budget Cycles yes when are those
 
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
unfun unspent funds end up
 
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
they stay in the pockets of rate payers
 
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
because what happens is our costs are
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
assessed by the business office of the
 
00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
energy Department to the utilities and
 
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
the utilities then recover those costs
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
from customers
 
00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:17.750 align:start position:0%
from customers
so

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
in that case I'm not sure we need a note
 
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
these these are not General funds
 
00:20:27.409 --> 00:20:27.419 align:start position:0%
the the issue is
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
if we leave it this way he could if he
 
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
wanted to spend all of it
 
00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
right but if we change it he has to
 
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
decide this or that right so
 
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.090 align:start position:0%
decide this or that right so
um

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
because he would have the authority to
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
to do all that spending
 
00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mr Hoffman could just just
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
prepare something and we can take a look
 
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
at it next week
 
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
yes what now would you like the language
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
to go both ways
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
so in other words uh out of tenants out
 
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.450 align:start position:0%
so in other words uh out of tenants out
of

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
salary benefits into litigation
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
if needed or if circumstances change
 
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
would you like the ability to go from
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
litigation back into salary and benefits
 
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
all right we'll take a look at that not
 
00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
that you need anything else to do but we
 
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
can take a look at the language next
 
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.029 align:start position:0%
can take a look at the language next
week

00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
I did have a question that's not
 
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
entirely uh Financial but
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
since you have become part of the
 
00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
Department of energy which came about
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
two years ago in the budget
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
your you were administratively attached
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
to the puc now your administratively
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
attached to the Department of energy it
 
00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
almost seems like a conflict to me that
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
you're trying to protect the rate payer
 
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
uh is there
 
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
any conflict that you shouldn't perhaps
 
00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
be with a say the Attorney General's
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
office or something to protect the
 
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:03.020 align:start position:0%
ratepayer versus being
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
Department of energy that may not have
 
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
the same protection drive that you have
 
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
as a consumer advocate that's an
 
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
excellent question and I've thought
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
about that question a lot I've thought
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
about whether I should ask you to change
 
00:22:21.169 --> 00:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
my administrative attachment and I've
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
decided that I should not if you look at
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
the administrative attachment statute
 
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
which is section 10 of RSA 21g you'll
 
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
see that it really is an attachment for
 
00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
administrative purposes in the sense
 
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
that my my only formal relationship to
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy is I use their
 
00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
business office meaning they create my
 
00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:45.539 align:start position:0%
budget documents for me and they do all
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
of the back office functions that any
 
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
state agency needs and what the
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
department of Energy's business office
 
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
knows how to do that the Business Office
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
of the Attorney General's office doesn't
 
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
know how to do is has to do with that
 
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
assessment process they literally send
 
00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
the bills to the utilities and the
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
utilities pay them because that's how
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
they're funded and that's how the puc is
 
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
funded and of course they're also right
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
in the building with us we're all all
 
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:16.340 align:start position:0%
housed at the Walker building on the
 
00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
corner of the what used to be the state
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
hospital so so it's administratively
 
00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
convenient and appropriate and it
 
00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:27.539 align:start position:0%
doesn't otherwise entangle us with the
 
00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
Department of energy or the puc since
 
00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
the creation of the Department of energy
 
00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
it has been very very careful not to
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
attempt to influence me and it certainly
 
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:41.700 align:start position:0%
doesn't purport to oversee me in fact I
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
think a lot of the time they would like
 
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
you to know very emphatically that they
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
do not take any responsibility for what
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
I do or say
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
so who hires you
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
um my enabling statute is RSA 363
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
section 28 and what it says is that
 
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
there's a body called the residential
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
ratepayers Advisory Board which acts as
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
a sort of a gatekeeper so my current
 
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
term expires in November and I have
 
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:13.980 align:start position:0%
asked to be reappointed and so in the
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
first instance The Advisory board
 
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
deliberates on that question and they
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
either will or will not recommend me to
 
00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:24.539 align:start position:0%
the governor for reappointment if they
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
do not recommend me for reappointment
 
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
then I have to go somewhere else and
 
00:24:30.409 --> 00:24:30.419 align:start position:0%
find a new job if they do recommend me
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
then the governor gets to decide whether
 
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
he would like to re-nominate me and if
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
he does that then I have to be confirmed
 
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
by the executive Council and if I am
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
turned out of office or just leave
 
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
office then the residential ratepayers
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board is tasked with
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
interviewing new candidates for the job
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
and their job then become is writing the
 
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
governor a letter with three names on it
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
and the governor is supposed to choose
 
00:24:57.649 --> 00:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
and nominate one of those three people
 
00:24:59.810 --> 00:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
that's how I originally got the job
 
00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
all right tell you're a good lawyer you
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
know all the facts representative Weiler
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
who are the members of that Advisory
 
00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.890 align:start position:0%
who are the members of that Advisory
Board

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
Board
 
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh that's another excellent question so
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
the uh Governor appoints three of the
 
00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:18.059 align:start position:0%
members of The Advisory Board the
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
president of the Senate appoints three
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
and the Speaker of the House appoints
 
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
three and there are if you look in my
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
enabling statute particular
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
constituencies like the elderly and the
 
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
disabled who are represented on The
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
Advisory board but in Practical terms
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's really a discretionary call by
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
those three elected officials
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
I wonder who the representatives are now
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
well for example uh one of the new
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
members of my Advisory Board is a
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
gentlemen most of you are probably
 
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
familiar with his name is Neil Kirk and
 
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh representative Kirk I assure you is
 
00:25:56.269 --> 00:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
an extremely active and Lively member of
 
00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
my Advisory Board and I really enjoy
 
00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
interacting with him because he he
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't take he he doesn't accept
 
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
anything at face value he is the patron
 
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:09.740 align:start position:0%
saint of extremely skeptical questions
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
extremely skeptical that's well put
 
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm grateful to uh it's actually
 
00:26:18.169 --> 00:26:18.179 align:start position:0%
representative Vos the chairman of
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
Science Tech and energy who uh convinced
 
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk to accept that
 
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
appointment and then I think he
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
convinced the speaker to make that
 
00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:27.059 align:start position:0%
appointment and it's been uh it's been
 
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
fun and and I think it's improved it's
 
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
made me a sharper rate payer Advocate
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
answering all of his questions and the
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
third individual the house member uh
 
00:26:39.529 --> 00:26:39.539 align:start position:0%
well I only named one uh and I forget
 
00:26:42.049 --> 00:26:42.059 align:start position:0%
who I don't really think very much about
 
00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:44.039 align:start position:0%
who appoints which of my Advisory board
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
members uh one of the speaker's
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
appointments is held by our chairman uh
 
00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
who is a businessman from Key named Tom
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
Moses I would just you I think
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler asks who are the
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
other State Rep was that's what we're
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
just looking for I thought you said
 
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
there were threes the speaker has three
 
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
appointments to my advisory
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
there are uh there's uh Jim Garrity a
 
00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
former state representative is also a
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
member of our Advisory Board I think he
 
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
was also appointed by the speaker now we
 
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
can look it up representative it's on
 
00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:18.539 align:start position:0%
our website yeah
 
00:27:18.539 --> 00:27:19.610 align:start position:0%
our website yeah
okay

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
I thought if there was an opening maybe
 
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative cambrell's could fill
 
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.710 align:start position:0%
representative cambrell's could fill
that

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.049 --> 00:27:30.059 align:start position:0%
anyway uh one further question yeah I
 
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
just what are the other responsibilities
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
of the board in addition to appointing
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
or recommending you for appointment that
 
00:27:39.649 --> 00:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
is its major responsibility the board
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
does meet quarterly and I I treat it
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
like a board of directors I I I pretend
 
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
that I'm an executive director of a
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
non-profit reporting to a board and so I
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
send that board quarterly a detailed
 
00:27:57.049 --> 00:27:57.059 align:start position:0%
report I write along four Page Letter to
 
00:27:59.210 --> 00:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
the board every quarter and I give them
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets with all of our uh
 
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
litigation or administrative activity
 
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
all of our legislative advocacy and all
 
00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
all right so uh moving right along I'd
 
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
like to get an opinion from the division
 
00:28:21.549 --> 00:28:21.559 align:start position:0%
about the additional person
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative Kimbrell's
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
well again uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:27.779 align:start position:0%
speaking from experience I've had a lot
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
of exposure to this department having
 
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
been on stne and I have to say that they
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
do an excellent job protecting the rate
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
payer and I'm also very pleased at how
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know they do defend our policy here
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire and
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
um uh I believe this is a value
 
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
proposition that if we add the
 
00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:51.539 align:start position:0%
additional person we may find uh
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
that some monies are not being spent
 
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
correctly you're talking billions of
 
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
dollars here and I think it's a value
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
proposition for us to put that person in
 
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.169 align:start position:0%
proposition for us to put that person in
place

00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
well just a caution for years a lot of
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
agencies would put more people in the
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
budget than they actually had so we
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
passed a law that said
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
a Personnel costs including benefits and
 
00:29:21.529 --> 00:29:21.539 align:start position:0%
and so on and part-time and full-time
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
could not be spent anywhere else in the
 
00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
budget so if we if we have them going
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
back and forth the consultant may take
 
00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:30.539 align:start position:0%
it but obviously if we put it in law
 
00:29:33.169 --> 00:29:33.179 align:start position:0%
it's a law change but it would have to
 
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
be a kind of an exceptional thing
 
00:29:36.889 --> 00:29:36.899 align:start position:0%
because it's normally it's not allowed
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
anyway I'm gonna go look on another
 
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
division all right you've caused enough
 
00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
all right representative Griffin do you
 
00:29:51.529 --> 00:29:51.539 align:start position:0%
have a comment or question yeah I
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
I feel very strongly that we should have
 
00:29:57.769 --> 00:29:57.779 align:start position:0%
a voice on those voids
 
00:30:00.289 --> 00:30:00.299 align:start position:0%
um particularly because
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
our Direction Maybe
 
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
quite a bit different than the other
 
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.010 align:start position:0%
quite a bit different than the other
states

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:06.020 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059 align:start position:0%
and I think it's really really important
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
our own oversight on those boards and i
 
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
would support it I would support the
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
additional personnel all right General
 
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
consensus I see a thumbs up and we okay
 
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
all right we'll
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
suggest that when we go to the full
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
committee that you get a new another
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
position and we'll get a footnote uh to
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
address representative McGuire's
 
00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
concerns yeah together with an hb1 yep
 
00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:39.299 align:start position:0%
cut a little bit Yeah okay thank you
 
00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:42.299 align:start position:0%
so the overall number doesn't balloon
 
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
yeah because I think your budget over
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
what was spent in 22 is about 35 uh 350
 
00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
000 more so it's pretty substantial
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
increasing I know the rate you know we
 
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
say no General funds but we want to keep
 
00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
the rates down even though it may be
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
just a couple of pennies but it's all it
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
all adds up in the end of course I
 
00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
heartily concur as I have to because I'm
 
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:07.820 align:start position:0%
the ratepayer
 
00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you very much thank
 
00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:11.690 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you very much thank
you

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:11.700 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
so next we have the department of energy
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
and I see the
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
folks out there if you want to state
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
your name please for the record
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
my name is Jared jocoin I'm the
 
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
this is our 341 I believe right on the
 
00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
budget I'm sorry I didn't mean to step
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
on you there oh no no no worries uh good
 
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
morning Rory Patterson I am the director
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
of the administration division at the
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:50.940 align:start position:0%
we we don't have a handout for the
 
00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:51.950 align:start position:0%
we we don't have a handout for the
committee

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
um didn't know exactly how you wanted to
 
00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.649 align:start position:0%
um didn't know exactly how you wanted to
handle

00:31:54.649 --> 00:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
handle
 
00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
um our requests in hb2 I can start with
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
the appropriation we we requested for a
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
regional fund
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
um but happy to take it line by line
 
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:09.299 align:start position:0%
um from the text of the bill
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
yeah we have a number of
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:27.289 --> 00:32:27.299 align:start position:0%
we start on page 49 with section 139 and
 
00:32:30.409 --> 00:32:30.419 align:start position:0%
it goes through page 51 down to section
 
00:32:30.419 --> 00:32:33.830 align:start position:0%
it goes through page 51 down to section
147.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
all right so we can check off 139 that
 
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:48.289 --> 00:32:48.299 align:start position:0%
one forty 140 is also a consumer app
 
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
yeah so 139 140 we can check those two
 
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
off or we have a question yeah did you
 
00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
see line 10 of page 49 so this is
 
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
already sort of a footnote yeah that's
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
you see in House Bill 2 line 10 page 49
 
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
yeah yes that would permit
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
the office to accept additional funds
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
through an assessment
 
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
um it's not quite the same thing okay
 
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah all right
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
I still need you to spell yourself sure
 
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
so starting at 141 I believe and page
 
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:44.690 align:start position:0%
so starting at 141 I believe and page
49.

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
um so uh We've proposed
 
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
um several just technical changes to the
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
parts of the statute related to our
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
collection of the assessment and this is
 
00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
really to help us do that process more
 
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.110 align:start position:0%
really to help us do that process more
efficiently

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
turn it over to Rory she might be able
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
to uh talk you through that a little
 
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
better than I can so happy to do so I
 
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
oversee the Department's business office
 
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
which calculates the assessment each
 
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
year for regulated entities including
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities competitive suppliers
 
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
aggregators telephone providers and
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
um as Don mentioned earlier the
 
00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
assessment is paid by ratepayers and so
 
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
it's very important to calculate that
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
correctly and to do so in a way that
 
00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
we're not going back and doing
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
recalculations and rebuilding which
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
would essentially cost money in terms of
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
the um work of the business office and
 
00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
cost time as well
 
00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
um number 141 and I'm happy to take any
 
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
questions as I go along uh 141 what that
 
00:34:58.970 --> 00:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
does is it really
 
00:35:01.849 --> 00:35:01.859 align:start position:0%
um clarifies uh what year the business
 
00:35:04.849 --> 00:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
office and the regulated entities use to
 
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
to calculate their revenues and and the
 
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
assessment right now there's a little
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
bit of a conflict between a section of
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
the statute that applies to assessment
 
00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
exemptions and the statutes that apply
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
to calculations of revenues as well as
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
there's a conflict in the um a rule
 
00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:27.500 align:start position:0%
applicable to the competitive suppliers
 
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
and the aggregators related to
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
exemptions and what we're trying to do
 
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
is align the year to the annual year
 
00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:38.579 align:start position:0%
rather than to the fiscal year in some
 
00:35:38.579 --> 00:35:39.670 align:start position:0%
rather than to the fiscal year in some
instances

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
instances
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
what this does actually is it gives the
 
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
business office additional time to do
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
this important calculation right now
 
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
when there are requests when when
 
00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
entities provide us fiscal year
 
00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
information they could be doing that in
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
July and right now the statute requests
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
the calculation and the issuance of the
 
00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
assessment in August
 
00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
um so by moving it to an annual year for
 
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
those entities they would be expected to
 
00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
file their revenue information in and
 
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:14.870 align:start position:0%
file their revenue information in and
around

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
um March or April which would give the
 
00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
business office additional time during a
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
very busy period where they're closing
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
the books for the year they're doing the
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
inventory they're also in some years
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
um working on the proposal for the
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
Governor's budget uh like in this year
 
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
and so there it's a very intensely busy
 
00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
period of time and more time is better
 
00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
for everyone the business office staff
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
as well as a customer or the entities
 
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
because of the correct calculation
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
if you turn any questions
 
00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
if you turn to um number 142 what this
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
does is it it moves the first assessment
 
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
um date and the dates that follow that
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
out by a month and the reason for this
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
change is that the actual expenses for
 
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
the prior fiscal year for the Department
 
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
is not are not known until after the
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
extended 12th which ends usually in Late
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
July and so the existing statute has the
 
00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
deadline for the first assessment as
 
00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
August 10th that gives very little time
 
00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
to finish the calculation that's needed
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
um the next change relates to entities
 
00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
less than ten thousand dollars and for
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
some of those entities it may be that
 
00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
they just pay their entire bill at the
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
time of the first Assessment bill
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
um but it does just codify our practice
 
00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
right now we issue the assessment for
 
00:37:55.609 --> 00:37:55.619 align:start position:0%
the whole year and we continue to issue
 
00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
what's due
 
00:37:59.089 --> 00:37:59.099 align:start position:0%
um in the subsequent
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
um dates for issuing them and the or
 
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
only just um
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
relates to the payment one-time payment
 
00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
after the first Assessment bill
 
00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
any questions so far members I guess
 
00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you very
 
00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
much Mr chairman thank you both for
 
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
being here today just to make sure we
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
don't catch you guys in a headache the
 
00:38:25.609 --> 00:38:25.619 align:start position:0%
actual putting the 15th of each month
 
00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
into law if I were to fall on a Saturday
 
00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
or Sunday would that create a storm for
 
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
you guys where you need an adjustment or
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate that consideration
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
I think what we would do in that
 
00:38:41.329 --> 00:38:41.339 align:start position:0%
instance would be we would issue the
 
00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:44.579 align:start position:0%
assessment bills before the before the
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
weekend day or the holiday but I think
 
00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
just uh having a change in a couple of
 
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.970 --> 00:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
uh turning to I hope this is going okay
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
I haven't done this in a long time uh
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
turning to pay uh number one uh
 
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.950 align:start position:0%
turning to pay uh number one uh
43

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
43
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
um what this does is
 
00:39:09.359 --> 00:39:10.609 align:start position:0%
um what this does is
it

00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:10.619 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:39:10.619 --> 00:39:12.010 align:start position:0%
it
um

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:12.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
what it primarily does is it enables us
 
00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
to save
 
00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
um thousands of dollars a year in
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
sending out the assessment bills by
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
certified mail we are not doing
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
registered mail I will acknowledge um
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
which is required by
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
um the statute now we use certified mail
 
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
and I want to say it's about eight
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year and what this
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
does is just modernize our ability to
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
send out the assessment via email or
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
regular mail and I presume
 
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
um the practice I guess would be that
 
00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
um the postmark date would would control
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of the deadline for the bill oh
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
actually it's the due date for the bill
 
00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:00.900 align:start position:0%
and by stating a due date for the bill
 
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
it makes it clear when the payment is
 
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.250 align:start position:0%
it makes it clear when the payment is
due

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
due
 
00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
um rather than having it within 30 days
 
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:14.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:17.339 align:start position:0%
so the assessments you're speaking of
 
00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:20.339 align:start position:0%
have you increased these assessments at
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
all in the last year or two or ah that
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question and they're
 
00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
fairly consistent in the twelve thousand
 
00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
dollar or I'm sorry 12 million dollar
 
00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.130 align:start position:0%
dollar or I'm sorry 12 million dollar
range

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
range
 
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
um they've been consistent
 
00:40:34.609 --> 00:40:34.619 align:start position:0%
um year after year
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:43.329 --> 00:40:43.339 align:start position:0%
uh number 144 uh what this does
 
00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
essentially as well is
 
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
um what I said earlier is just change
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
change the calendar uh you change it to
 
00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:56.220 align:start position:0%
calendar year and not fiscal year
 
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
so the division we would like to check
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
off a few more here uh
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
and it was at 144.
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
are you okay with that thanks it's just
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
technical yeah
 
00:41:29.569 --> 00:41:29.579 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mr Hoffman also
 
00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
the big one now yeah now the big one
 
00:41:34.089 --> 00:41:34.099 align:start position:0%
that gets our attention
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
and for that I'll turn it over to the
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner so I don't have to do it
 
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Rory
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
um so in 145 establishment of the
 
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
regional energy advocacy fund this
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
relates to the conversation you just had
 
00:41:49.849 --> 00:41:49.859 align:start position:0%
with the consumer Advocate
 
00:41:49.859 --> 00:41:50.510 align:start position:0%
with the consumer Advocate
um

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
in RSA 374 F colon 8. just like to read
 
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
the last couple lines it
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
provides you sort of the charge we've
 
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
been given in statute as it relates to
 
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
Regional energy issues says the
 
00:42:04.609 --> 00:42:04.619 align:start position:0%
department shall Advocate against
 
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
proposed Regional or federal rules or
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
policies that are inconsistent with the
 
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
policies rules or laws of New Hampshire
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
in its participation in Regional
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
activities the commission and the
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
department shall consider how other
 
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
states policies will impact New
 
00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rates and work to prevent or
 
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
minimize any rate impact the commission
 
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
or Department determines to be unjust or
 
00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.490 align:start position:0%
or Department determines to be unjust or
unreasonable

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
unreasonable
 
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
and as the consumer Advocate mentioned
 
00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.609 align:start position:0%
and as the consumer Advocate mentioned
earlier

00:42:28.609 --> 00:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
um I serve as the Nesco manager for New
 
00:42:31.079 --> 00:42:32.089 align:start position:0%
um I serve as the Nesco manager for New
Hampshire

00:42:32.089 --> 00:42:32.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:42:32.099 --> 00:42:33.170 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
um

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
for the consumer advocate he has a vote
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
at knee pool where he's asking for that
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
additional staff resource to help with
 
00:42:39.839 --> 00:42:40.849 align:start position:0%
additional staff resource to help with
that

00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:40.859 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:40.859 --> 00:42:41.810 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
our need for this funding is when there
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
are and the consumer Advocate did an
 
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
excellent job talking about transmission
 
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
costs and all that's being planned and
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
what could be on the horizon as it
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
relates to cost for our ratepayers
 
00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
and currently we have two positions at
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
the department that work on wholesale
 
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
Regional issues Dan Phelan who is our
 
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
director is here today
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
um and we have two positions right but
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to resources to do this
 
00:43:11.809 --> 00:43:11.819 align:start position:0%
work if we have to make a filing at ferc
 
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
um a challenge something at the federal
 
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
level as it relates to transmission
 
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
costs in particular
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
um there are times when we really do
 
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
need additional analytical support that
 
00:43:25.849 --> 00:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
we we may not have those uh that
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
expertise in the agency we tend to be
 
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
um as our team does a great job though
 
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
we tend to be more generalists um on on
 
00:43:37.609 --> 00:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
these issues so the the support of fun
 
00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
that we can draw on to hire the needed
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
analytical support or contracts that
 
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
need analytical support it's very
 
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:44.809 align:start position:0%
need analytical support it's very
important

00:43:44.809 --> 00:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
um at ferc uh the Attorney General's
 
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
office would represent us
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
um but again it would be very important
 
00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
to have that technical support
 
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
um and we need that funding to do that
 
00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
um high level what this request is about
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
um it again relates very uh closely to
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
what the consumer Advocate is requesting
 
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative cambril so you're my new
 
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
expert on this stuff so any thoughts or
 
00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
it's right in line with what the
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate does except it's the
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
department of energy and I can under
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
certainly understand that
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
um where there more more of their people
 
00:44:28.609 --> 00:44:28.619 align:start position:0%
are generalists why they might need an
 
00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
expert in this particular uh for this
 
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
particular type of thing and it is a big
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
dollar there's a lot of money exchanging
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
hands here the you know again the
 
00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars but
 
00:44:44.089 --> 00:44:44.099 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear other people's thoughts
 
00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
too on it though representative Sweeney
 
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you again
 
00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
for being here so I so when we're
 
00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
talking about the the billions of
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
dollars and trying to find
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
because it's not recoveries in the sense
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
that we would with other departments
 
00:44:59.809 --> 00:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
where we might have been wronged in the
 
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
past and we get a lump sum back we're
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
looking for future savings for the
 
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
ratepayers correct okay yeah and and
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
these um Regional and at the regional
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
level at the federal level as it relates
 
00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:13.140 align:start position:0%
to cost allocation
 
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of these potential transmission
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
projects are driven by the policies of
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states and um you know
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we are
 
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
adequately protecting and representing
 
00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:29.339 align:start position:0%
the interests of New Hampshire repairs
 
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
um in all of those proceedings
 
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
and one follow-up thank you and so so
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
the general idea is that while we don't
 
00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
know exact dollar amounts but we're
 
00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
putting 250 000 from the ratepayers in
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
the hopes of protecting the ratepayers
 
00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
from more than 250 000 in future rates
 
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's correct I presume
 
00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339 align:start position:0%
camber else thank you Mr chair that was
 
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
exactly the line that I was going to ask
 
00:45:58.370 --> 00:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
um so have you done any projections to
 
00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
say to maybe to kind of make us feel
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
better here what the what the return on
 
00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
investment would be you know if you
 
00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
looked at it in those terms what do you
 
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
think potentially we could save the rate
 
00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
payer if we invest this money Dan could
 
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
give exact numbers but I think you know
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking at tens of millions of
 
00:46:16.079 --> 00:46:17.030 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking at tens of millions of
dollars

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.109 align:start position:0%
dollars
um

00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
or more he's telling me um it could be
 
00:46:23.089 --> 00:46:23.099 align:start position:0%
in the hundreds of Millions
 
00:46:23.099 --> 00:46:23.809 align:start position:0%
in the hundreds of Millions
um

00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:25.609 --> 00:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
an additional cost
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
so we were to fund this would um would
 
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
there be maybe a report back to the
 
00:46:32.809 --> 00:46:32.819 align:start position:0%
legislature a year from now two years
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
from now if in fact you know will you be
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
tracking that that we'd be happy to
 
00:46:38.569 --> 00:46:38.579 align:start position:0%
report on that
 
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
um and and would be happy to report
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
um in conjunction with the consumer
 
00:46:44.089 --> 00:46:44.099 align:start position:0%
Advocate if you're open to that I think
 
00:46:47.089 --> 00:46:47.099 align:start position:0%
we're working on these issues closely
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
um so I think we would be more than
 
00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:52.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.609 --> 00:46:55.619 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire yeah thank you Mr
 
00:46:55.619 --> 00:46:56.750 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire yeah thank you Mr
chairman

00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:46:59.690 --> 00:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
um why are we doing it this way rather
 
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
than adding to the consultant line
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
directly in house bill one in your
 
00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:07.940 align:start position:0%
budget I think I'm looking at page 341
 
00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
uh class item 046 Consultants where you
 
00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
currently have zero so I mean this is it
 
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
seems like a weird way to do it
 
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
well I think having a dedicate what
 
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
we're looking for is a dedicated fund
 
00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:24.890 align:start position:0%
we're looking for is a dedicated fund
um

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
that will support this effort
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
um we believe in clearly the governor
 
00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
believed including an hb2 that it was
 
00:47:32.819 --> 00:47:34.130 align:start position:0%
believed including an hb2 that it was
important

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
um that we uh establish a fund that's
 
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:39.980 align:start position:0%
dedicated to this
 
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
yeah I I didn't hear a reason there I
 
00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.390 align:start position:0%
yeah I I didn't hear a reason there I
mean

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
this is to hire Consultants you have a
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
line there's a budget line for
 
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
Consultants that has zero
 
00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
what if it had 120 250 000 you know what
 
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
I mean it's
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
it it it's a great question but I think
 
00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
um establishing a a a precedent
 
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
um for us as a new department and the
 
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
important work that we do long term I
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
think it's it's uh it it's good to have
 
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
something that is actually a stake in
 
00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
the ground that we are we're making an
 
00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
investment in protecting our ratepayers
 
00:48:18.589 --> 00:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
at the regional level
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
sure uh if I if I may just add something
 
00:48:25.609 --> 00:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
uh and it did most of the
 
00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
um expertise that the department would
 
00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
file uh would request from ratepayers
 
00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
are related to the costs of consultants
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
and dockets and they would be done
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
through this special assessment but when
 
00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
the department needs consultation
 
00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
consultants for broader public policy
 
00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:47.390 align:start position:0%
consultants for broader public policy
issues

00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
um those would not necessarily be
 
00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
recovered through the assessment so I
 
00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
just wanted to to note that those
 
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
assessment funds may be used for the
 
00:48:59.690 --> 00:48:59.700 align:start position:0%
broader like renewable or offshore wind
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
or things that are not directly tied to
 
00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:06.180 align:start position:0%
something that can be special assessed
 
00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:08.060 align:start position:0%
it's an excellent point thank you
 
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I don't understand that so
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
you're saying money in house bill one
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
you can't spend on these items
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
um no sir let me explain why I don't
 
00:49:20.569 --> 00:49:20.579 align:start position:0%
like this because when you create a
 
00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund it for us it becomes out
 
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
of sight out of mind you know we don't
 
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
look at the the balance and all
 
00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds of which there's a lot
 
00:49:34.609 --> 00:49:34.619 align:start position:0%
right we look at this book every two
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
years and so that bring that's what
 
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
brings it up to us to to budget right
 
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
that so so doing it this way
 
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
this is a fund you get to spend however
 
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
you want to spend it
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
and we'll never see it again you know
 
00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
unless you say we need more into it
 
00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
right but but if it's in the budget and
 
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's a regular item every year then
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
I think back to to Rory's point about
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
not being able to specially assess the
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
utilities for this um that is one
 
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:10.140 align:start position:0%
important I think argument for this
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
being its own fund
 
00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
um I can't specially assess eversource
 
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
um for this work that we're doing
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.609 --> 00:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
all right other further questions on
 
00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
are you all all okay with the 250 and
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
creating this fun representative cameras
 
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair again I I believe
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
it's a value proposition for the
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
ratepayer at the end of the day so that
 
00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:07.619 align:start position:0%
would be and again I I don't like
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
spending money and but uh this is a
 
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
complicated issue that's why
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire you probably
 
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
didn't understand the answer because it
 
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
is very complicated uh but I I would I
 
00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:23.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:26.809 --> 00:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
everybody else
 
00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:29.720 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
and 146
 
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
I guess we're going to win 47 that's uh
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
creating what general counsel yes so so
 
00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
the general counsel that position does
 
00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
exist and has existed but in the last
 
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
um budget for uh uh
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
22 23 we the position existed there was
 
00:51:59.329 --> 00:51:59.339 align:start position:0%
some back and forth in the budget
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
process last time about where the
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
general counsel position should be it
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
ended up landing at the department where
 
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
we believe we do need a general counsel
 
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
um so we have a general counsel he is
 
00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
with me today so the position exists
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
it's funded we just want to make sure
 
00:52:17.569 --> 00:52:17.579 align:start position:0%
that it's in the statute for the
 
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
department and that
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
um I have the ability because it's an
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
unclassified position I have the ability
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
to um appoint that individual
 
00:52:29.809 --> 00:52:29.819 align:start position:0%
just adding that language to the statute
 
00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
I believe that's everything
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr Hoffman
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
so now we I guess we'll turn quickly to
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
your budget I did see a couple of things
 
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
that caught my eye but we'll
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
think you start on
 
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
while members are looking for
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
at your budget I just had a question on
 
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
141 the number of positions it shows you
 
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
going up from three to six I guess you
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
could tell us what those three
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
additional positions might be that's at
 
00:53:37.849 --> 00:53:37.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
um and Rory can correct me if I'm wrong
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
I believe those are the full-time
 
00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:47.579 align:start position:0%
temporary positions that we created to
 
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
administer some of the new federal
 
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
funding that we're receiving as a result
 
00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:54.260 align:start position:0%
of the Federal Building
 
00:53:58.609 --> 00:53:58.619 align:start position:0%
infrastructure funding and iija and Ira
 
00:54:00.829 --> 00:54:00.839 align:start position:0%
I saw a lot of federal money for fuel
 
00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
assistance was like 30 million yes we
 
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
would also to help in that line as well
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
um so we have not we have not requested
 
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
full-time temporary positions for LIHEAP
 
00:54:13.609 --> 00:54:13.619 align:start position:0%
but we have for our weatherization
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
assistance program which is receiving
 
00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
um compared to what we usually receive
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
considerable increase in funding over
 
00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
the next several years
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm pretty sure that but I I'll have
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
to double check with the business office
 
00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
and um I can get back to you on that on
 
00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:29.339 align:start position:0%
those positions but I believe that's
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
what that is
 
00:54:32.329 --> 00:54:32.339 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:54:36.049 --> 00:54:36.059 align:start position:0%
further questions from the division on
 
00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:38.220 align:start position:0%
the budget uh
 
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
why you're all looking I had a question
 
00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
on uh site
 
00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:47.630 align:start position:0%
on uh site
evaluation

00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
the authorized for
 
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
23 was 286 000 but I see in the next
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
years it's uh other funds so these
 
00:55:15.049 --> 00:55:15.059 align:start position:0%
assessments will be to people applying
 
00:55:17.329 --> 00:55:17.339 align:start position:0%
versus any general fund money because I
 
00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
think when this whole thing was set up
 
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
General funds were there to get you
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
started so we're
 
00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
going away from General funds and into
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
other funds is that right I believe so
 
00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
but I I don't necessarily want to answer
 
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
for the SEC uh the um the the chairman
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
of the Public Utilities Commission
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
chairs the SEC and they have an
 
00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:38.579 align:start position:0%
administrator so you may want to double
 
00:55:38.579 --> 00:55:39.349 align:start position:0%
administrator so you may want to double
check

00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:41.339 align:start position:0%
um with them but I believe what uh how
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:55:50.329 --> 00:55:50.339 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman there's a footnote
 
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
below that account yeah it allows them
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
to return to the fiscal committee
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
for General funds
 
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
now remember we gave them some funds
 
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
that get started and I think so but I
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
was just curious whether they were just
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
all completely moving away from General
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
funds and then just having an assessment
 
00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
on those applying for a site evaluation
 
00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:15.770 align:start position:0%
on those applying for a site evaluation
permit

00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
all right well I guess that's what our
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
memories that's correct or well we can
 
00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
any further questions with the
 
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not I don't want to rush anybody
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire yeah I have a
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
question on page 356.
 
00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:37.730 align:start position:0%
question on page 356.
your

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:38.150 align:start position:0%
your
[Music]

00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:39.069 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:56:39.069 --> 00:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
transfers to Information Technology are
 
00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
going down in half we don't usually see
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
things go down when the information
 
00:56:46.319 --> 00:56:50.089 align:start position:0%
things go down when the information
technology

00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:50.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing though thank you for
 
00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
catching did you have a project that the
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
the finished or something like that
 
00:56:57.119 --> 00:56:58.010 align:start position:0%
the finished or something like that
um

00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question it may be
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
related to our appropriation when the
 
00:57:04.609 --> 00:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
when the department was created
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
um uh there there were um
 
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
uh several projects related to our
 
00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
website the creation of our website and
 
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
a new website for the commission as well
 
00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not certain I can get back to you on
 
00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:18.170 align:start position:0%
I'm not certain I can get back to you on
that

00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
okay and the other question I have in
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
this general area of this is
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
administrative support
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
right the number of positions is
 
00:57:32.089 --> 00:57:32.099 align:start position:0%
declining by a third
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
but benefits and so on is increasing
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:40.319 --> 00:57:40.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
or at least thing maybe is staying about
 
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
if if there's fewer people there should
 
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
be fewer
 
00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:53.210 align:start position:0%
be fewer
um

00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:53.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question I would
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
need to get back to you on that okay
 
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
I think you were fortunate because you
 
00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
did your relatively new two years old so
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
you get all new computers to start off
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
so hopefully that doht line will remains
 
00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
low for the foreseeable 10 years perhaps
 
00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
everybody else seems to be always trying
 
00:58:23.569 --> 00:58:23.579 align:start position:0%
to catch up at least you started off
 
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
with new equipment
 
00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
and I know that dyt works with you know
 
00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
obviously the needs they determine much
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh
 
00:58:38.569 --> 00:58:38.579 align:start position:0%
sorry a couple of Thumbs Up Everybody
 
00:58:41.089 --> 00:58:41.099 align:start position:0%
okay to move along and maybe you can
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
just get that follow-up information to
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
all the LBA folks but
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
I don't see any need not to just check
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
the department of energy off as well and
 
00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
are we okay with that
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much sir thank
 
00:58:55.559 --> 00:58:57.170 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much sir thank
you

00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.049 --> 00:59:06.059 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks you too
 
00:59:08.089 --> 00:59:08.099 align:start position:0%
be a good day for us when this is all
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner arlinghaus you are
 
01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:00.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
microphones help don't they uh I'm
 
01:03:05.089 --> 01:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
Charlie arlinghaus I'm the commissioner
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
of administrative Services who are you I
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
am Sheri Rockburn and I'm the assistant
 
01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:11.270 align:start position:0%
am Sheri Rockburn and I'm the assistant
commissioner

01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:14.339 align:start position:0%
um so we have on your agenda it lists
 
01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
the things we're going to mention to you
 
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
but we're happy to talk to you about
 
01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.890 align:start position:0%
but we're happy to talk to you about
anything

01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:03:20.569 --> 01:03:20.579 align:start position:0%
um I'll show you the classified pay grid
 
01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:23.339 align:start position:0%
the unclassified grid the pay warrant
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
for the hp2 pay Race by branch and then
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about the upgrade to the Erp
 
01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
system uh somebody and apparently the
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
it's the guy with the tie asked about
 
01:03:34.559 --> 01:03:36.130 align:start position:0%
it's the guy with the tie asked about
um

01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:36.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:38.329 --> 01:03:38.339 align:start position:0%
diagonal pay I'm sorry that's
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
disrespectful because the honorable man
 
01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
with the tie
 
01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:43.309 align:start position:0%
with the tie
um

01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:45.170 align:start position:0%
um
yes

01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
um and so the
 
01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.849 align:start position:0%
um and so the
yeah

01:03:48.849 --> 01:03:48.859 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
oh that was really poorly thought out by
 
01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.609 --> 01:03:58.619 align:start position:0%
didn't help at all
 
01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
um so so the diagonal equity which
 
01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:02.579 align:start position:0%
exists in the system and and somebody
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
noticed with the unclassified system
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't exist and the answer to
 
01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
yes it doesn't exist
 
01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.910 align:start position:0%
yes it doesn't exist
um

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:13.609 --> 01:04:13.619 align:start position:0%
uh so in between the two you can see the
 
01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:16.140 align:start position:0%
diagonal on the on the classified grid
 
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
and it's as people probably know when
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
you get a promotion let's say for the
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
sake of argument you were
 
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
you applied for a job and you're
 
01:04:25.609 --> 01:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
currently let me see if I can do this
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
right you're 27 step five let's just say
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
and you get promoted to a 29.
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
the way we actually promote you as you
 
01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
go you go diagonally down to where you
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
are so you would go down to 29 3 which
 
01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
is diagonally the same and then up one
 
01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
and that's how we determine your new
 
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.030 align:start position:0%
and that's how we determine your new
salary

01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
salary
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
um uh too much detail for you to know
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
but it's sort of fun so you hear anybody
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
ever say diagonal plus one that's what
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
they're referring to
 
01:04:55.849 --> 01:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
um the classified distribution this came
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
up a couple of times with questions
 
01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
somebody said how many people in what
 
01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
step and all of that and um this is data
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
that we publish annually in the
 
01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
Personnel report how many people are at
 
01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
the maximum step how many people are in
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
the period where you have to wait two
 
01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.970 align:start position:0%
the period where you have to wait two
steps

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
steps
 
01:05:12.589 --> 01:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
um I think this came up as a result of
 
01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:13.980 align:start position:0%
those some of the questions when we
 
01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
talked to full fiscal
 
01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
and kind of where people are just gives
 
01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
you a sense where things are
 
01:05:23.809 --> 01:05:23.819 align:start position:0%
then slide page five shows you the
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
current unclassified grid
 
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.010 align:start position:0%
current unclassified grid
um

01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
somebody asked me why why is this not
 
01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
why is this goofy I think goofy is the
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
right term
 
01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
um and I say goofy because you know in
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
the classified system
 
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
you know it's roughly four percent
 
01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
between step eight and step nine and
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
it's roughly four percent between labor
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
grade this and labor grid that and
 
01:05:49.609 --> 01:05:49.619 align:start position:0%
there's a it looks very thought through
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
and mathematical
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
and this looks haphazard the gap between
 
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
some steps is you know two percent and
 
01:05:58.730 --> 01:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
some steps is eight percent or some
 
01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.589 align:start position:0%
some steps is eight percent or some
grades

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
grades
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
and I think it was developed haphazardly
 
01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
and periodically back in a very long
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
time ago
 
01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.589 align:start position:0%
time ago
um

01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
when they did raises people focused on
 
01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
the classified system and unclassified
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
was an afterthought and then things were
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
added and changed in the last 20 years
 
01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
there's been Equity
 
01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
um to do what's compression issues but
 
01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
it wasn't always so so there's no
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
diagonal equity
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
surely yes believe it or not we have
 
01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
like a lot of people watching and people
 
01:06:34.809 --> 01:06:34.819 align:start position:0%
have asked the question about
 
01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
unclassified classified maybe you could
 
01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
give just a brief overview of the three
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
different areas so
 
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
um in the state system classified
 
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
employees are are what we think of as
 
01:06:50.569 --> 01:06:50.579 align:start position:0%
state workers almost every state
 
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
employees they classified
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
quote Civil Service employee and it is a
 
01:06:58.849 --> 01:06:58.859 align:start position:0%
it is a system that's developed a civil
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
service system that was developed in in
 
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
you know in every state and in our in
 
01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
our state and it goes back to the 30s
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
and 40s and was standardized in in 1950
 
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
and it is it is meant to be essentially
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
all the employees and it's why sometimes
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
we talk about people being paid hourly
 
01:07:17.329 --> 01:07:17.339 align:start position:0%
because that system is based on hourly
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
rates you know whether you make
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
um twenty six thousand dollars a year or
 
01:07:23.329 --> 01:07:23.339 align:start position:0%
you make a hundred and six thousand
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
dollars a year you're paid as a hourly
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
for 37 and a half hours there's some
 
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
schedules where you're paid 40 hours but
 
01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:31.609 align:start position:0%
schedules where you're paid 40 hours but
generally

01:07:31.609 --> 01:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
generally
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
um for 75 years 37 and a half hours is
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
our base schedule and that is basically
 
01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
your basic state employees there are two
 
01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
groups that are exceptional to that one
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
is the unclassified system which
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
um 50 or 80 years ago were called state
 
01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.270 align:start position:0%
um 50 or 80 years ago were called state
officers

01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
officers
 
01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
and were spelled out it was the
 
01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
treasurer the Comptroller the it was
 
01:07:58.970 --> 01:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
essentially agency heads and deputies
 
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
that system has evolved so that instead
 
01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:06.059 align:start position:0%
of being 40 people it's 350 people I
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
think it's something like 384 positions
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
out of 12 000. but so you know the the
 
01:08:15.529 --> 01:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
bulk of state workers both part-time and
 
01:08:17.689 --> 01:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
full-time are paid under the classified
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
system the system that categorizes
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
everybody efficiently there's a separate
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
unclassified system
 
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
um those classifications are done
 
01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
through a legislative committee jcec
 
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
it's called
 
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:31.799 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the division of personnel
 
01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
and all of that and it's it's typically
 
01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
leadership positions there's some
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
nuances to that I get like almost every
 
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
every commissioner and well actually
 
01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:45.980 align:start position:0%
every commissioner and agency had
 
01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
usually their deputies and usually
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
they're division heads are in that
 
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.789 align:start position:0%
they're division heads are in that
system

01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
um 30 years ago
 
01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
uh Terry Morton got permission to create
 
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
about 90 of them at HHS
 
01:09:03.169 --> 01:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
that run a range they aren't necessarily
 
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
all leadership positions but usually
 
01:09:07.849 --> 01:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
it's the leadership of departments are
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
unclassified which is a salaried
 
01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.650 align:start position:0%
unclassified which is a salaried
position

01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:09:15.289 --> 01:09:15.299 align:start position:0%
um and the rank and file are classified
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
there's a third group of people which is
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
non-classified and you might think of
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
that as much more strictly political
 
01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.789 align:start position:0%
that as much more strictly political
appointees

01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
appointees
 
01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
um which are a separate category under
 
01:09:30.769 --> 01:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
under flsa the federal rules so the
 
01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
governor's entire staff is
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
non-classified these are not necessarily
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
budgeted by position and are not
 
01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
necessarily budgeted by salary
 
01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
um I I like to say not doesn't exactly
 
01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
work this way but for example the
 
01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
governor's office has given a dollar
 
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
figure here's a half a million dollars
 
01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
for your people you could pay one person
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
a half a million dollars if you wanted
 
01:09:54.169 --> 01:09:54.179 align:start position:0%
wouldn't operate well but you could or
 
01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
you could pay everybody next to nothing
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
and there's no restriction on that it's
 
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
just you you do it and you do your rules
 
01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:03.860 align:start position:0%
legislative employees are typically
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
non-classified positions although
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
there's some exceptions to that and
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
their legislature has its own separate
 
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
grid and things like that but
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
non-classified there are very few rules
 
01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.189 align:start position:0%
non-classified there are very few rules
around

01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
except the rules that affect everybody
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
those also
 
01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
also are traditionally appointed so
 
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
there are point of positions either
 
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
through a governor Council process and
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's how the individual ends up in
 
01:10:36.169 --> 01:10:36.179 align:start position:0%
them or a commissioner or agency had
 
01:10:37.729 --> 01:10:37.739 align:start position:0%
would appoint that person into that
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
position so those also fall under that
 
01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
and the classified is where most of the
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
bargain positions are
 
01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
and there and the other point about
 
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
non-classified is you are you are
 
01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
permitted legally to have almost no
 
01:10:52.729 --> 01:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
protection for them right so in theory
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
and that's why we talk about political
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
appointees a governor
 
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
um the speaker maybe the speaker of the
 
01:10:59.450 --> 01:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
house could say to his chief of staff
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know come back Monday
 
01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:02.810 align:start position:0%
you know come back Monday
um

01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
not not best practice but um and I'm
 
01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:08.460 align:start position:0%
sure he wouldn't but technically there's
 
01:11:09.649 --> 01:11:09.659 align:start position:0%
no protection you don't have to give
 
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
notice you don't have to have a reason
 
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
you can just do whatever you want
 
01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
because it's a political job
 
01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
um unclassified there are some
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
protections and government Council
 
01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
positions have one set and other
 
01:11:21.649 --> 01:11:21.659 align:start position:0%
positions have another but if you look
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
at page seven which is which is which we
 
01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
use to talk about the pay raise
 
01:11:27.169 --> 01:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
distribution and I'll go back and talk
 
01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
about page six it gives you a sense of
 
01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
the scope
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
think of legislative as not governed by
 
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
by most of the state rules they have
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
some of their own rules judicial has its
 
01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
own sort of set of rules and if you look
 
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
at the dollar amounts of the raise
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
multiply that by 10 it gives you a sense
 
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
of how much that is and how the Lion's
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
Share the executive branch for example
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
almost entirely is classified
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
in that system I'm going to come back to
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
this in a second but flip back to page
 
01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
six if you will
 
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
how is the pay raise budgeted and this
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
is one of the questions we got
 
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
the pay raise is budgeted by funds we
 
01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
figure out how much a pay raise is going
 
01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
to cost and then we apply a fund mix to
 
01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:12.900 align:start position:0%
it to figure out how much it has to cost
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
by fund because what the legislature
 
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
does is budget what the government does
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
if you will is budget by fund and so if
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
you have enough General funds and not
 
01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
enough liquor funds that's a problem and
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
and the funds tend not to be fungible
 
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
versus each other this is a long this is
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
a complicated process that we try to
 
01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
refine every year to get it just right
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that we're budgeting
 
01:12:39.649 --> 01:12:39.659 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that needs to be
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
budgeted but no more than needs to be
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
budgeted in order to pay for the pay
 
01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.490 align:start position:0%
budgeted in order to pay for the pay
raise

01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
raise
 
01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
um and so the budget document
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
historically has always had the pay
 
01:12:53.209 --> 01:12:53.219 align:start position:0%
raise budgeted by fund
 
01:12:56.810 --> 01:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
so that um although the The increased
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
cost of salaries is going to be about a
 
01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
hundred and one million dollars
 
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
um almost 45 of it is General funds and
 
01:13:09.169 --> 01:13:09.179 align:start position:0%
so you don't end up budgeting 85 million
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
in general funds or 65 million in
 
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
general funds you budget the amount you
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
need so that's the budgeted number
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
for each year and that's the number
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
very helpful
 
01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
oh I wanted to add no this is very
 
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
helpful the only other thing I was going
 
01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
to add is as Charlie as a commissioner
 
01:13:33.169 --> 01:13:33.179 align:start position:0%
talked about in terms of you know how we
 
01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
budget this is also based on or I should
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
say it's not based on total positions
 
01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
that are authorized you know we really
 
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
look at field positions we look at
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates we do a projection of
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
where we're going to be we obviously as
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
Charlie said only want to give money
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
where it's needed we don't want to over
 
01:13:53.209 --> 01:13:53.219 align:start position:0%
budget for that so that's just an
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
important thing as we drill into the
 
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
numbers is that it's really looking at
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
your actual employees that are that are
 
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
going to be staffed and and that's a
 
01:14:03.490 --> 01:14:03.500 align:start position:0%
historical thing where legislators
 
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
legislatures in the past have said why
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
are you setting aside money we're not
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
going to spend we're you're forcing us
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
to spend
 
01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
um let's just say we budgeted every
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
every position instead of the positions
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
that will be filled you would end up
 
01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
budgeting let's just say for the sake of
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
argument 10 more and someone says why am
 
01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
I why am I depriving myself of 5 million
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
a year to to address priorities that the
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
legislature identifies when you know
 
01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
you're not going to spend it because
 
01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be a vacancy
 
01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
rate whatever the range of it is and so
 
01:14:37.729 --> 01:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
that's something that that has been
 
01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
hammered into
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
um administrative Services budgeting
 
01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
people for many many decades by
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
the collective you so to speak
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the Grid on page seven
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
that just gives you an idea I know
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of the question about
 
01:14:58.729 --> 01:14:58.739 align:start position:0%
what's what's in the legislative branch
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
what's in the executive branch what's in
 
01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:01.669 align:start position:0%
what's in the executive branch what's in
the

01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
um what's classified what's
 
01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
non-classified there are other way other
 
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
ways to parse this out but this is sort
 
01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
of the big picture for you and and we
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
did General funds and all funds just to
 
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
give you a sense and
 
01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
um I hope that helps you and that that
 
01:15:18.649 --> 01:15:18.659 align:start position:0%
gets at some of the questions you're
 
01:15:18.659 --> 01:15:20.630 align:start position:0%
gets at some of the questions you're
asking

01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
asking
 
01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:23.689 align:start position:0%
asking
okay

01:15:23.689 --> 01:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:23.699 --> 01:15:42.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:52.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:56.890 --> 01:15:56.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
so he got a seven
 
01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:04.140 align:start position:0%
so if we go to page 72
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
that's where a lot of this starts and
 
01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
those sections are on page 72 through 75
 
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's sections 195 to 209.
 
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:34.370 --> 01:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
that again starts at 1.95 through
 
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
209 are we okay with that it's a lot of
 
01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
money but I think the Department's done
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
an excellent job in Breaking this out
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's one of my questions I was curious
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
and the breakdown because other
 
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
divisions are looking for money
 
01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:03.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I see the
 
01:17:08.689 --> 01:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
unclassified table in the in the house
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
bill too but I don't I'm I mean the
 
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
class yeah I'm classified I don't see
 
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
the classified
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
too so there are um there are
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
technically something like 30 or 35
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
classified tables and and historically
 
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
um many of them are in the various
 
01:17:25.130 --> 01:17:25.140 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements and
 
01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
it's you know the correction officers
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
are paid this way and the law
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement schedule and all those and
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
and historically the the legislature had
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
adopted one table
 
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
and then there was kind of a wink like
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
you'll adjust the other ones the same
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
way right but I never said that and we
 
01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
didn't do 30 so we in uh I think it was
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
two years ago in the legislation we uh
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
we amended um that section English RSA
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
99 but don't hold me to that to say that
 
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
administrative Services shall adjust all
 
01:17:58.490 --> 01:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
the pay tables accordingly and so
 
01:17:59.530 --> 01:17:59.540 align:start position:0%
um but the
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
the so the pay tables don't have to be
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
in statute on the unclassified table
 
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is in statute and so you
 
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
have to adopt it
 
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's not a yeah it's not created by the
 
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
formula and there's only one right so
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
instead of 35 or whatever it is
 
01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
depending if you count schedules and
 
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.970 align:start position:0%
 
really

01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:30.709 align:start position:0%
really
interesting

01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
no I I just wanted to be really clear so
 
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
this is an across the board 10 raise on
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
all the branches
 
01:18:37.679 --> 01:18:38.810 align:start position:0%
all the branches
right

01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:40.729 align:start position:0%
right
yes

01:18:40.729 --> 01:18:40.739 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
and we just we haven't seen nobody's
 
01:18:44.689 --> 01:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
Left Behind no we haven't seen the
 
01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
um technically for legislative employees
 
01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the process is that
 
01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.149 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the process is that
um

01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
the legislature has to vote separately
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
to adopt the raise for legislative
 
01:19:03.649 --> 01:19:03.659 align:start position:0%
employees and I believe that fiscal
 
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
adopts one group of employees and the
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
facilities committee adopts the other
 
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
group of employees for the legislature
 
01:19:14.090 --> 01:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
and those committees my understanding is
 
01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
technically you can do whatever they
 
01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:16.189 align:start position:0%
technically you can do whatever they
want

01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:19:27.649 --> 01:19:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
play the facilities committee is meeting
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
the morning of March 24th and that's
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
when they're going over the legislative
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
budget which is sort of it's sort of
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
outside of the time period that we have
 
01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
to be done but just
 
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
to make that note and then just follow
 
01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
so the unclassified positions are all
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
the leadership positions and their rate
 
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
of pay starts at a much higher level so
 
01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
the 10 percent is
 
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
a bigger the um the the unclassified
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
schedule uh runs from AAA on up and what
 
01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
I do mean to imply is that most
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
leadership positions are unclassified
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
but not every unclassified position is
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
in leadership so the the A's are about
 
01:20:16.130 --> 01:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
the equivalent of if you if you compare
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
and um the
 
01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:25.070 align:start position:0%
and um the
um

01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:28.010 --> 01:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
at the sort of mid-range the highest
 
01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
classified schedule
 
01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:31.430 align:start position:0%
classified schedule
is

01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
um 35s are about a GG so with the
 
01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
exception that
 
01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
I think everyone here knows that it's
 
01:20:42.729 --> 01:20:42.739 align:start position:0%
difficult has been difficult for years
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
to get employ some employees who accept
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
a promotion
 
01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
if they're classified moving and
 
01:20:52.729 --> 01:20:52.739 align:start position:0%
unclassified because you give up over
 
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
time and you go from a 37 and a half
 
01:20:56.510 --> 01:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
hour schedule
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
where you are literally legally
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
prohibited from working a 38th hour I
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
mean my first three months on the job we
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
wrote somebody up for working
 
01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
um which was very
 
01:21:09.890 --> 01:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
hard to because they you know if you
 
01:21:12.169 --> 01:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
work I must pay you and if I'm not
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
budgeted money to pay you you must not
 
01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
work or I'm going to commit an illegal
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
act under federal law and so so that
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
there's a there's some there's a
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
compression issue in state government I
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
think everyone knows that representative
 
01:21:26.689 --> 01:21:26.699 align:start position:0%
McGuire's question yeah so I assume it's
 
01:21:28.669 --> 01:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
not 40 hours because there's a half hour
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
lunch is that the idea
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
no no it's in a in fact on a on a
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
on a 30 I believe on a 37 and a half
 
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
hour schedule it's a seven and a half
 
01:21:43.130 --> 01:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
hour day but seven and a half does not
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
include you let's say you work uh let's
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
just say for the sake of argument an
 
01:21:49.010 --> 01:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
eight to four schedule it's eight to
 
01:21:50.930 --> 01:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
four but you have a half hour lunch you
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
are contractually required to take a 15
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
minute break for which you are paid the
 
01:21:58.669 --> 01:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
half hour lunch you are not paid
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
and if you work eight to four Thirty and
 
01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
take an hour lunch that's okay too
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
right but so therefore I think the
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
answer is yes as opposed to no but all
 
01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:09.590 align:start position:0%
answer is yes as opposed to no but all
right

01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:22:12.830 --> 01:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
the the main problem I have but that I
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
what I mean to say is the difference
 
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
between those on a 37 and a half hour
 
01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
schedule and those on a 40-hour schedule
 
01:22:20.209 --> 01:22:20.219 align:start position:0%
is not that one of them gets a longer
 
01:22:20.219 --> 01:22:22.729 align:start position:0%
is not that one of them gets a longer
lunch

01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:22.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:22.739 --> 01:22:24.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:26.209 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:22:26.209 --> 01:22:26.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
the main I don't have a problem with
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
this raise thing but I just think
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we would need to be
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
mindful of it but on page six the people
 
01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
were we're gonna make the most difficult
 
01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:41.390 align:start position:0%
were we're gonna make the most difficult
um

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:43.729 --> 01:22:43.739 align:start position:0%
the most problems for it to me seems to
 
01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
be division two
 
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
because Highway fund Turnpike fund those
 
01:22:51.729 --> 01:22:51.739 align:start position:0%
are not sort of variable Revenue sources
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
right they those are very fixed you know
 
01:22:57.290 --> 01:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
so many so many cents per gallon of gas
 
01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:00.300 align:start position:0%
and so many uh you know registration
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
fees and stuff like that and and we're
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
adding 20 million dollars 20 and a half
 
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars of Highway fund expenses
 
01:23:13.729 --> 01:23:13.739 align:start position:0%
by approving this right and so I think
 
01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
they're going to be in trouble but we
 
01:23:18.890 --> 01:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
haven't heard them I would encourage you
 
01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
if you look at the governor's executive
 
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
budget summary one of the things that
 
01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
includes in it is Surplus statements for
 
01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
all of the funds which Sherry's going to
 
01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
point out now all include the pay raise
 
01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
in them
 
01:23:34.850 --> 01:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
and all include a positive balance
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
so and the only other thing I would say
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
is that if you work at Fish and Game
 
01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
you're probably also having trouble
 
01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:44.270 align:start position:0%
you're probably also having trouble
hiring

01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
and your workers are also having trouble
 
01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:50.219 align:start position:0%
keeping up with inflation and and
 
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
it would seem weird to deny them
 
01:23:55.250 --> 01:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
well it's a follow-up to representative
 
01:23:57.770 --> 01:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
McGuire none of these pay raises were in
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
any of the budgets that we've reviewed
 
01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
so it's they're they're not they're not
 
01:24:05.689 --> 01:24:05.699 align:start position:0%
in the budget itself but because they're
 
01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
a separate House Bill 2 item
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
um it means that there is money there is
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
money available and and they would not
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
have been
 
01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
you know the the governor legally has to
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
present a balanced budget and and if you
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
if you look at it it's not just balance
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
but it's balanced
 
01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
um not even what Surplus revenues that
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
way in terms of the pay raise so
 
01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
although as you know we've the Ways and
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
Means Committee has found he was a
 
01:24:33.169 --> 01:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
little too optimistic in his Revenue
 
01:24:33.179 --> 01:24:35.510 align:start position:0%
little too optimistic in his Revenue
numbers

01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't have to do resonance
 
01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:37.930 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't have to do resonance
anymore

01:24:37.930 --> 01:24:37.940 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
too lucky
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
um are there any more questions
 
01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:47.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
represented grassy not to put you on the
 
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative evil did you want
 
01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
to hold back on the legislative portion
 
01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
just because we haven't seen their
 
01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
budget or
 
01:25:06.169 --> 01:25:06.179 align:start position:0%
well it's a thought I don't know what
 
01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
the rest of the division thinks I mean
 
01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
budget Isn't So under the statute the
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
the uh facilities committee is the one
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
that sort of reviews the legislative
 
01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
budget and blesses it
 
01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:23.689 align:start position:0%
budget and blesses it
um

01:25:23.689 --> 01:25:23.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
and that's on March 24th in the morning
 
01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:28.310 align:start position:0%
and that's on March 24th in the morning
so

01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
we won't have their feedback for our
 
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
review so I don't know how that works we
 
01:25:37.130 --> 01:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
do have their budget in here the
 
01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:39.830 align:start position:0%
do have their budget in here the
proposal

01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
you know we just saw everybody's aware
 
01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
we have to have everything done by
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
Tuesday so the LBA can work on it and uh
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
get it out for next week because we have
 
01:25:52.729 --> 01:25:52.739 align:start position:0%
a session of course Wednesday and
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
Thursday represents Sweeney thank you Mr
 
01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure we're I'm
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
thinking of the right conversation we're
 
01:25:59.689 --> 01:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
having are you talking about the
 
01:26:02.030 --> 01:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
legislative pay raises or the whole
 
01:26:05.149 --> 01:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
legislative branch budget well
 
01:26:05.159 --> 01:26:06.169 align:start position:0%
legislative branch budget well
point

01:26:06.169 --> 01:26:06.179 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
all I was saying is it's hard to approve
 
01:26:11.689 --> 01:26:11.699 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch in some ways
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
until we know what they're doing so
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
I just put it out there I just I'm not
 
01:26:19.390 --> 01:26:19.400 align:start position:0%
sure the division realized that
 
01:26:22.450 --> 01:26:22.460 align:start position:0%
facilities has to approve the
 
01:26:26.209 --> 01:26:26.219 align:start position:0%
legislative branch budget and we won't
 
01:26:28.729 --> 01:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
have a benefit of having a conversation
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
with them before we have to
 
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
give our blessing to the division one
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
recommendations is that right Mr chair
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's correct yeah so Mr chairman if I
 
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
if I could offer I don't know if this is
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
helpful or not but um
 
01:26:46.729 --> 01:26:46.739 align:start position:0%
historically with things like the pay
 
01:26:50.689 --> 01:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
raise what what has happened is that
 
01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:53.219 align:start position:0%
um the legislative finance committee can
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
approve the money being made available
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
should the facilities committee Etc
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
decide to Grant it I'm not aware of a
 
01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
situation where they've decided not to
 
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
Grant it in the past I don't want to you
 
01:27:09.169 --> 01:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
know pass performance as no indicator of
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
future results but um but I would say
 
01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
that that one of the things the
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
legislature could consider doing at
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
least on the pay raise portion I don't
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
want to speak to the rest of it
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
um is you could go ahead and pass it and
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
so the money would be available for them
 
01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
to know that they could decide one way
 
01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
or the other to accept it or reject it
 
01:27:31.129 --> 01:27:31.139 align:start position:0%
and that way you're not
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
um you're not doing a half your budget
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
now in that sense yeah just a follow-up
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
to that the fiscal committee like
 
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
approves all the LBA adjustments and pay
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
races specifically that's where that
 
01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me because otherwise
 
01:27:48.669 --> 01:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
we're just going to have to come back
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
whatever folks think I just wanted to
 
01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
make sure we were aware of the deadlines
 
01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
were involved with
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
yeah it would be nice to get rid of a
 
01:27:59.930 --> 01:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
large chunk here if we could today I
 
01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:00.709 align:start position:0%
large chunk here if we could today I
think

01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
we all recognize that all the state
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
employees need a pay raise I I guess my
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
question initially was that as far as
 
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
those leadership roles what was the
 
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
impact because obviously they're the
 
01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
well except for Charlie and the most
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
compensated as far as state staff but um
 
01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
certainly all the classified employees
 
01:28:25.490 --> 01:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
really deserve a raise and
 
01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:27.780 align:start position:0%
I think mostly a classified employees
 
01:28:30.410 --> 01:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
are union members and they did negotiate
 
01:28:32.450 --> 01:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
in good faith now Charlie just a quick
 
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
question are there any unclassified that
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
are union members they know like in my
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
industry the railroads that many people
 
01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
that become managers hold on to their
 
01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
union rights and pay the monthly fees so
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
they can still be part no and not in the
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
state in the state system they aren't
 
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
then and they're in fact there are a
 
01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
number of other positions typically
 
01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
um some senior managers and people are
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
involved directly or indirectly in the
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
bargaining discussions and and data
 
01:29:04.010 --> 01:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
process who are so-called confidential
 
01:29:06.530 --> 01:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
employees and therefore not eligible to
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
join the union
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
but um so none of the unclassified or
 
01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
Union knowledgeable
 
01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
um most of something like 92 percent of
 
01:29:17.330 --> 01:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
the classified are eligible
 
01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
okay so representative McGuire are you
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
prepared to move like all those items
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
from 195 through
 
01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
209 yes
 
01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:29.750 align:start position:0%
209 yes
um

01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:33.709 --> 01:29:33.719 align:start position:0%
so I just in general I mean the amount
 
01:29:35.930 --> 01:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
of the raise is similar to inflation
 
01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
right the the there's no question about
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
that and also the the constant refrain
 
01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
we hear from people is we can't fill
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
positions right well that's a sign that
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
we're not paying enough right not that
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
we're paying too much
 
01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
um there's only very few agencies have
 
01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
come in and said well yeah all our
 
01:29:57.649 --> 01:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
positions are full I mean I heard that
 
01:30:01.490 --> 01:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
once maybe in the past month right so so
 
01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I think these are reasonable all
 
01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
um any further discussion everybody okay
 
01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
with that simple show of hands for those
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
sections 195 through 209 all right
 
01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
thanks that's uni nms
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
and while we're not far from 194.
 
01:30:28.729 --> 01:30:28.739 align:start position:0%
uh that's parking and Concord I think
 
01:30:30.169 --> 01:30:30.179 align:start position:0%
there were some questions we didn't
 
01:30:31.550 --> 01:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
check it off
 
01:30:34.850 --> 01:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
I guess it's um
 
01:30:37.129 --> 01:30:37.139 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sad to say I don't have Hospital
 
01:30:39.169 --> 01:30:39.179 align:start position:0%
2 in front of Meek and then is there any
 
01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:42.380 align:start position:0%
chance somebody has an extra copy
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
is this 50 000 for parking yeah there
 
01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
was a note that I wasn't enough or
 
01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
something it was like
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
50 000 but that was only half what was
 
01:30:56.209 --> 01:30:56.219 align:start position:0%
yeah I enough is one of those questions
 
01:30:56.219 --> 01:30:57.890 align:start position:0%
yeah I enough is one of those questions
so

01:30:57.890 --> 01:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:57.900 --> 01:30:59.450 align:start position:0%
so
um right

01:30:59.450 --> 01:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
um right
 
01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:01.970 align:start position:0%
um right
um

01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:04.250 --> 01:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
most most state buildings have parking
 
01:31:06.649 --> 01:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
near them somewhere
 
01:31:08.770 --> 01:31:08.780 align:start position:0%
um almost all of them have parking lots
 
01:31:11.149 --> 01:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
attached to them certainly the campus
 
01:31:13.610 --> 01:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
does in Hazen Drive does Pillsbury
 
01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
Street does South Street does
 
01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
um but if you happen to work downtown in
 
01:31:20.450 --> 01:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
the State Library the doj that will soon
 
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
be torn down or the annex
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
almost nobody has parking and so for
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
decades the Union contract included in
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
one of the subunit agreements the admin
 
01:31:34.010 --> 01:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
Services subunit agreement which is not
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
terribly controversial we get Park money
 
01:31:37.970 --> 01:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
for parking and Boots
 
01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:38.990 align:start position:0%
for parking and Boots
um but

01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
um included 50 000 for parking this was
 
01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
moved into House Bill 2 instead of the
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
CBA because there have been years when
 
01:31:49.850 --> 01:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
the CBA is in Evergreen
 
01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
and that provision was not in Evergreen
 
01:31:54.770 --> 01:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
and we asked for it to be moved for this
 
01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
reason that well there's a well there's
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
a thought that some things shouldn't be
 
01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
an evergreen because it encourages
 
01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
bargaining I don't think I don't think
 
01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
the fifty thousand dollars for a handful
 
01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
of employees who have no parking space
 
01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
um was really moving the needle one way
 
01:32:14.090 --> 01:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
or the other and so for the from a
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
bargaining standpoint it's not a big
 
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
deal from uh from a few hundred people
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
who are like trying to figure out what
 
01:32:24.410 --> 01:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
to do it's it was a big deal so we put
 
01:32:25.729 --> 01:32:25.739 align:start position:0%
in House Bill two instead of in the
 
01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
Union contract that's all and it's been
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
50 000 for a few years
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
so we're okay now with 194 the language
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
and well so we can check that off
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
194 Mr Kane when it says as appropriated
 
01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
where is it appropriated
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
so that is in a um in a dedicated
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
account well I shouldn't say dedicated
 
01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
in an accounting unit that's in our
 
01:32:52.010 --> 01:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
budget the accounting unit um is called
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
special disbursements and there's a
 
01:32:55.610 --> 01:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
class line directly in-house Bill one
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
for that I don't have my full budget in
 
01:32:59.570 --> 01:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
front of me but I can give you the page
 
01:33:01.010 --> 01:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
numbers the department of the Commission
 
01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
in the office of the commissioner yeah I
 
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
think we brushed across it that's why I
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
had a memory of fifty thousand dollars
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
it's the same accounting unit with the
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
governor's transition fund the money we
 
01:33:12.970 --> 01:33:12.980 align:start position:0%
pay for the Concord Fire Protection
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
I think we pay EAP out of that
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
accounting unit yeah yeah it's not that
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's not dedicated
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
um it's on to age 50 yeah yeah it's on
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
page 59 of your um of House Bill 1 page
 
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
59 the account is called special
 
01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
and as you get there so once again page
 
01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:38.390 align:start position:0%
and as you get there so once again page
59

01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
59
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom is a line that says
 
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
class 213 Concord fire and Municipal
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
Services it's 175 000. 50 000 of that is
 
01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
to the city for parking cards
 
01:33:56.090 --> 01:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
um they average about 140 in um for a
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
person and the remaining 125 is a
 
01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
payment that we make to the city
 
01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:01.790 align:start position:0%
payment that we make to the city
um

01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:04.129 --> 01:34:04.139 align:start position:0%
to assist with uh fire police other
 
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
services that we that we may need from
 
01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:06.830 align:start position:0%
services that we that we may need from
them

01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
um but it's not a direct bill or
 
01:34:09.890 --> 01:34:09.900 align:start position:0%
anything like that that's just also been
 
01:34:10.970 --> 01:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
um it's been the same number for a
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
really long time how much is it per car
 
01:34:16.129 --> 01:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.649 --> 01:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
parking nights now
 
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
um it adds up to 50 000 though so if you
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
were to use your parking card so I'm
 
01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
very fortunate and feel guilty every day
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
um that I have a parking space so
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
um and and it's and it you literally
 
01:34:34.129 --> 01:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
feel guilty every day because people are
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
walking and you're like hi I know you
 
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
have to park in the garage or on the
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
street and it's snowy and I feel bad but
 
01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:43.070 align:start position:0%
street and it's snowy and I feel bad but
um

01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:45.290 --> 01:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh if you were to use your card every
 
01:34:47.090 --> 01:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
day to cover the hours that you're there
 
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
for the entire day would last you about
 
01:34:52.010 --> 01:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
further people tend to use it on snow
 
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
days we try to have a uh when the
 
01:34:59.450 --> 01:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
legislature is not using store Street
 
01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:01.430 align:start position:0%
legislature is not using store Street
and

01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
and Terry's willing
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
um we um people can park on store Street
 
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
and we try to have a free parking option
 
01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
and run a shuttle and for the other 50
 
01:35:13.850 --> 01:35:13.860 align:start position:0%
weeks what do people do they either
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
store street during the off season your
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
off season
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
um some of that they pay out of their
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
pocket or they Park in it used to be the
 
01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
Old Highway Garage on
 
01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:25.370 align:start position:0%
Old Highway Garage on
um

01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:27.729 --> 01:35:27.739 align:start position:0%
store Street and we would shuttle them
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
although we're now running that out of
 
01:35:31.610 --> 01:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
South Street the building on South
 
01:35:33.649 --> 01:35:33.659 align:start position:0%
Street that used to be the hospital
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
down by Tuckers but
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
as somebody said to me you know if you
 
01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
if we if you're an accountant and you
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
take a job at Edmond Services you're
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
actually taking a pay cut
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
and and I'm like I know just can we not
 
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
from a budgetary standpoint you can't
 
01:35:59.570 --> 01:35:59.580 align:start position:0%
cover 52 weeks it's just not
 
01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
all right so we we're okay with 194
 
01:36:03.239 --> 01:36:04.729 align:start position:0%
all right so we we're okay with 194
okay

01:36:04.729 --> 01:36:04.739 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
I'd like to move if we could quickly to
 
01:36:12.850 --> 01:36:12.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:15.649 --> 01:36:15.659 align:start position:0%
sure I should have one more item on hb2
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
and that was
 
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
um their upgrade the appropriation for
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
the upgrade of the Erp system it's um on
 
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:28.860 align:start position:0%
page 70 of hb2 section 186 and 187 it's
 
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
a 7.8 million dollar appropriation in
 
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
um of my handout for you slides eight
 
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
nine and ten are about this if you want
 
01:36:48.050 --> 01:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
me to lather
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to be quick because I I know
 
01:36:50.689 --> 01:36:50.699 align:start position:0%
we don't want to go from parking to
 
01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
Parks without a pallet cleanser
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
that's good huh
 
01:36:59.330 --> 01:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
um uh this is for the ER Erp uh fiscal
 
01:37:00.649 --> 01:37:00.659 align:start position:0%
committee approved money recently and
 
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
I'll explain quickly uh what it is uh uh
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
page eight what is an Erp
 
01:37:08.209 --> 01:37:08.219 align:start position:0%
enterprise resource planning is a term
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
of art it's a computer-based integrated
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
system of an organization's business
 
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
prophecies processes HR payroll
 
01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.209 align:start position:0%
prophecies processes HR payroll
financials

01:37:17.209 --> 01:37:17.219 align:start position:0%
financials
 
01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
Etc it's every all of the software used
 
01:37:24.169 --> 01:37:24.179 align:start position:0%
to run the operation of the business the
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
business in this case is called the
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
government of the State of New Hampshire
 
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
and it's it's that it's it's the uh
 
01:37:32.689 --> 01:37:32.699 align:start position:0%
everybody on every desk every Financial
 
01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
Manager every HR manager Etc
 
01:37:39.970 --> 01:37:39.980 align:start position:0%
um traditionally uh it's been on premise
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
and uh all of these things are moving to
 
01:37:43.850 --> 01:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
the cloud
 
01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire first is what we call
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
ours uh apparently that technically
 
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
stands for something but don't ask me
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
what it is because no one can no one can
 
01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
remember and I think there might be two
 
01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:55.010 align:start position:0%
remember and I think there might be two
s's

01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
s's
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
um but um anyway it's a Statewide system
 
01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
and our current vendor is called infor
 
01:38:02.930 --> 01:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
which is a which is a large National
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
software company some of its competitors
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
are places like Oracle and workday and
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
names people will have heard of when we
 
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
bought the system originally the the
 
01:38:15.530 --> 01:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
company was called Lawson you may have
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
heard that name
 
01:38:19.370 --> 01:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
um infor bought loss in about 15 years
 
01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:21.110 align:start position:0%
um infor bought loss in about 15 years
ago

01:38:21.110 --> 01:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
um so page nine is why an upgrade
 
01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:26.830 align:start position:0%
um so page nine is why an upgrade
um

01:38:26.830 --> 01:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh the costs associated with our 14 year
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
old 14 year old that's a long time in
 
01:38:34.610 --> 01:38:34.620 align:start position:0%
Computer World on-premise System uh
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
continue to rise and we struggle to keep
 
01:38:38.990 --> 01:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
up with the latest supported version
 
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:39.530 align:start position:0%
up with the latest supported version
um

01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:42.050 --> 01:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
as of April the current version will no
 
01:38:43.729 --> 01:38:43.739 align:start position:0%
longer be supported think of it think of
 
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
Windows 98 if you will it's okay to run
 
01:38:47.810 --> 01:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
Windows 98 as long as you don't connect
 
01:38:50.810 --> 01:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
to the internet but um you're out of
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
luck because they don't support you
 
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
um and that's kind of where we are so
 
01:38:55.729 --> 01:38:55.739 align:start position:0%
the state has three options at this
 
01:38:57.410 --> 01:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
point we reached an inflection point and
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's why we're coming to you there are
 
01:39:02.330 --> 01:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
three basic options one is to do nothing
 
01:39:04.010 --> 01:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
although the state has occasionally
 
01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
taken this task in the past Dennis
 
01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
Goulet routinely yells at me when I say
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
this is one of our three options because
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
he said you know that's not really an
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
option I said I know but we did it
 
01:39:16.370 --> 01:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
before and he said but it's stupid we
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
can't do that I said I know but it's one
 
01:39:20.810 --> 01:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
of our options is do nothing so this is
 
01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
me telling you it's not a great option
 
01:39:25.370 --> 01:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
um the other two are to reprocure a new
 
01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
Erp system to go out to bid uh solicit a
 
01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
bunch of vendors and reprocure a new
 
01:39:32.209 --> 01:39:32.219 align:start position:0%
system three is to upgrade the existing
 
01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
system that we have this is often the
 
01:39:37.129 --> 01:39:37.139 align:start position:0%
question you have on upgrading systems
 
01:39:39.050 --> 01:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
of any size it's a big deal because this
 
01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:40.679 align:start position:0%
is so big
 
01:39:40.679 --> 01:39:41.530 align:start position:0%
is so big
um

01:39:41.530 --> 01:39:41.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:43.370 --> 01:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
reprocuring a new system we could get
 
01:39:45.169 --> 01:39:45.179 align:start position:0%
bids we might change vendors we might go
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
to workday we might go to Oracle we
 
01:39:48.770 --> 01:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
might go to I don't know all the vendors
 
01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
in the system anymore I know PeopleSoft
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
got bought by somebody if anybody
 
01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
remembers PeopleSoft
 
01:39:57.169 --> 01:39:57.179 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh we believe that would be a much more
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
expensive proposition and would require
 
01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
significant change management if
 
01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
somebody else uh about the system uh
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
Idaho is doing this and and it's more
 
01:40:10.490 --> 01:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
than 100 million
 
01:40:11.810 --> 01:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
um although probably we would be
 
01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
significantly less than that even though
 
01:40:15.370 --> 01:40:15.380 align:start position:0%
we're a similar
 
01:40:18.169 --> 01:40:18.179 align:start position:0%
size-ish of state and state government
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
as they are
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
um because they're they're abandoning
 
01:40:24.770 --> 01:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
some other Legacy systems but it would
 
01:40:26.450 --> 01:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
probably be
 
01:40:28.370 --> 01:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
um the last time Dennis Gillian I talked
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
he said he said definitely 2x like two
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
times as much but probably 3x or 4X
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
um in terms of total costs and the other
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
option is upgrade the existing system
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
with infor which is the path we're
 
01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:41.350 align:start position:0%
with infor which is the path we're
taking

01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:40:44.090 --> 01:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
that that passed the costs are on page
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
10 and the discussion of it is on page
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
10. it's about 25 million and again we
 
01:40:51.770 --> 01:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
think the we think the other of the
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
all-in costs are about 50 million
 
01:40:56.810 --> 01:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
um in February fiscal they approved 15
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
million of arpa funding which the arpa
 
01:41:02.930 --> 01:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
Gods granted to us
 
01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
um and 15 million not on the assumption
 
01:41:07.610 --> 01:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
that 15 is all it would cost but that
 
01:41:09.890 --> 01:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
we'll do 15 here and we'll do the rest
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
in out of hustle 2 Appropriations in the
 
01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:14.450 align:start position:0%
in out of hustle 2 Appropriations in the
budget

01:41:14.450 --> 01:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:18.189 align:start position:0%
budget
um

01:41:18.189 --> 01:41:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:20.510 --> 01:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
upgrading upgrading really is cost
 
01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
effective but it's a it's a once every
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
decade or so cost and it's not something
 
01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
you can account for in your operating
 
01:41:28.610 --> 01:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
budget and it's frankly brutal on the
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
capital budget too you know the capital
 
01:41:33.169 --> 01:41:33.179 align:start position:0%
budget if you tried to like go well I
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
had this thing and it's only 25 million
 
01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
in the capital budget everyone in that
 
01:41:39.050 --> 01:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
committee has a stroke it's um it's it's
 
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
just very difficult to do that they're
 
01:41:42.649 --> 01:41:42.659 align:start position:0%
like like we could do a couple of roofs
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's like a courthouse and
 
01:41:46.850 --> 01:41:46.860 align:start position:0%
then some if you will
 
01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
um and so this is one of the few times
 
01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
where we might even be able to do this
 
01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:51.950 align:start position:0%
where we might even be able to do this
so

01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:54.169 --> 01:41:54.179 align:start position:0%
um it's about 22.8 million that's why
 
01:41:57.050 --> 01:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
we're asking for 7.8 on top of the 15
 
01:41:58.850 --> 01:41:58.860 align:start position:0%
and I would just note the project is not
 
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
scalable it's a question people ask well
 
01:42:02.990 --> 01:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
can we just do like half the departments
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
in the state it's an all or nothing it's
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
an Enterprise System not a some agencies
 
01:42:10.850 --> 01:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
system and uh and I'll note from the
 
01:42:13.129 --> 01:42:13.139 align:start position:0%
standpoint think about it this way
 
01:42:15.410 --> 01:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
one of the major components of this is
 
01:42:17.330 --> 01:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
financial you know payroll and and
 
01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
State's finances the state has one set
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
of books
 
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
not multiple sets of books we have one
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
set of books even Al Capone had only one
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
set of books in fact I think that's how
 
01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
they caught him
 
01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
um what you'll see operationally is
 
01:42:34.850 --> 01:42:34.860 align:start position:0%
three separate contracts one is a
 
01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
contract with infor and that's to review
 
01:42:39.250 --> 01:42:39.260 align:start position:0%
the processes build test train Etc
 
01:42:41.890 --> 01:42:41.900 align:start position:0%
enforce the software company that's the
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
Microsoft if you will
 
01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
um Axiom
 
01:42:48.530 --> 01:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
um Axiom is an is an implementer they're
 
01:42:50.090 --> 01:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
an infor partner but they're a separate
 
01:42:52.850 --> 01:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
company uh and they're doing uh
 
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
simultaneously we're doing a transition
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
to what's called workforce management
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
which is a new time keeping system from
 
01:43:02.209 --> 01:43:02.219 align:start position:0%
what we do today and this is something
 
01:43:04.609 --> 01:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
that's been been working on or trying to
 
01:43:07.729 --> 01:43:07.739 align:start position:0%
work on for five to six years
 
01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
um and they'll compete that process
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
workforce management is an integrated
 
01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
part of the info Cloud Suite products
 
01:43:17.450 --> 01:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
and third we'll have an ivnv vendor
 
01:43:20.090 --> 01:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
independent verification
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
and validation vendor and that is
 
01:43:25.010 --> 01:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
um You probably saw this with the rims
 
01:43:27.890 --> 01:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
project at dra you want somebody
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
independent to tell you whether this is
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
going well or not otherwise you have to
 
01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
rely on me
 
01:43:34.970 --> 01:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
or the people doing the work and we're
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
always going to go no it's really
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
actually going much better than it looks
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
like and you don't need that you want
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
someone to say it is going about how it
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
looks like and they need to you know get
 
01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
their rearing gear on it so okay so
 
01:43:50.570 --> 01:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
that's the Erp funding
 
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
so representative McGuire has a question
 
01:43:53.930 --> 01:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
um how much do we pay ongoing for
 
01:43:58.970 --> 01:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
maintenance in this area and is that
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
being changed by by up doing this
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
upgrade um I think in the in the coming
 
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
year we'll pay roughly a million and
 
01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
they and after the upgrade will pay
 
01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:08.810 align:start position:0%
they and after the upgrade will pay
roughly

01:44:08.810 --> 01:44:08.820 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
um I can get you exact numbers roughly
 
01:44:13.189 --> 01:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
1.7 and we'll have a 10-year contract
 
01:44:18.229 --> 01:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
we could have a contract with an
 
01:44:22.270 --> 01:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
escalation of zero but it's a yeah right
 
01:44:25.729 --> 01:44:25.739 align:start position:0%
but so in a sense we're going to pay 70
 
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:28.860 align:start position:0%
percent more just for maintenance
 
01:44:30.729 --> 01:44:30.739 align:start position:0%
even though we have a brand new system
 
01:44:33.410 --> 01:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
yes it's
 
01:44:35.629 --> 01:44:35.639 align:start position:0%
um and frankly it's moving from uh
 
01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
moving from an on-premise system with a
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
maintenance contract to software as a
 
01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
service and it it's actually what's
 
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
happening with with everything in the
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know think of it think of it think
 
01:44:48.530 --> 01:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
of it this way you don't buy Microsoft
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
Office anymore you buy a subscription to
 
01:44:53.149 --> 01:44:53.159 align:start position:0%
Microsoft Office so will we save on the
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
hardware costs
 
01:44:56.689 --> 01:44:56.699 align:start position:0%
um we will have a modest reduction in
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
what we spend with doit and and some of
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
the uh servers and all that and I I mean
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
I've looked at all of those numbers and
 
01:45:05.639 --> 01:45:06.709 align:start position:0%
I've looked at all of those numbers and
um

01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
we will have a modest reduction but I
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to pretend to you that we're
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
going to save so much that this is a net
 
01:45:12.239 --> 01:45:13.790 align:start position:0%
going to save so much that this is a net
Financial

01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
Financial
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
bonus it's in that Financial cost
 
01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
right so I think we should approve this
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
the they've already spent two-thirds of
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
all right commissioner you have a pretty
 
01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
significant ask elsewhere too it's about
 
01:45:34.729 --> 01:45:34.739 align:start position:0%
six million dollars of the priority list
 
01:45:36.370 --> 01:45:36.380 align:start position:0%
that we saw
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh on the 24th of February so
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
would you
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
rather see this 7.8 million
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
or are there other assets that are
 
01:45:52.850 --> 01:45:52.860 align:start position:0%
equally as important on the other six
 
01:45:54.410 --> 01:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
million dollar side
 
01:45:57.169 --> 01:45:57.179 align:start position:0%
um the 7.8 is an ask that I cannot
 
01:45:59.450 --> 01:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
operationally do without
 
01:46:02.570 --> 01:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
okay so if it's an either War there's
 
01:46:04.669 --> 01:46:04.679 align:start position:0%
not there's not a choice the division
 
01:46:07.490 --> 01:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
does have some significant wiggle room
 
01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
we have like 84 million and one bill
 
01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
that's we have enacted on we've got
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
invest with 30 million so we do have
 
01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:16.609 align:start position:0%
invest with 30 million so we do have
some

01:46:16.609 --> 01:46:16.619 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:46:19.310 --> 01:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
wiggle room so I guess representative
 
01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
McGuire is putting forward the 7.8 at
 
01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
this point representative Griffin
 
01:46:28.609 --> 01:46:28.619 align:start position:0%
or if okay show a hands we're okay with
 
01:46:28.619 --> 01:46:30.350 align:start position:0%
or if okay show a hands we're okay with
that

01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
from scratch okay
 
01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:36.330 align:start position:0%
um we'll add that sorry Mr Kane
 
01:46:36.330 --> 01:46:40.729 align:start position:0%
um we'll add that sorry Mr Kane
[Laughter]

01:46:40.729 --> 01:46:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.129 --> 01:46:43.139 align:start position:0%
every time we add something we get an
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
email from Mr Kane telling us to be
 
01:46:47.770 --> 01:46:47.780 align:start position:0%
cautious yeah
 
01:46:49.850 --> 01:46:49.860 align:start position:0%
I'll just note that that was in the
 
01:46:54.590 --> 01:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:58.250 --> 01:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
all right so we can quickly move then I
 
01:46:59.689 --> 01:46:59.699 align:start position:0%
know Joe's got to get out of here at 11
 
01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
30 Joe yeah uh if we could look quickly
 
01:47:08.330 --> 01:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
um I think I discussed them in in some
 
01:47:12.770 --> 01:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
detail and I you know I think each of
 
01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
them is sort of a standalone
 
01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to say that that any of
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
them is a package
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
and um you know what we do and why we
 
01:47:24.169 --> 01:47:24.179 align:start position:0%
need them
 
01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
and uh I would just say operationally I
 
01:47:29.090 --> 01:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
do understand that if the
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
um if if it's one of those things
 
01:47:33.169 --> 01:47:33.179 align:start position:0%
nobody's getting nothing then good we're
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
fine with that but if you said to us
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
what's um
 
01:47:37.850 --> 01:47:37.860 align:start position:0%
you know what are your operational
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
challenges this is this is what they are
 
01:47:41.930 --> 01:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
and you know the one thing that is that
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
is very much a one-time spend as opposed
 
01:47:48.890 --> 01:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
to ongoing operations is the uh uh the
 
01:47:52.609 --> 01:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
maintenance funding the 3.5 yeah and
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
then the only other piece that that is
 
01:47:58.189 --> 01:47:58.199 align:start position:0%
one time and and by the way in the 3.6 I
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
think it is is scalable
 
01:48:02.450 --> 01:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
and as is the 1.2 and and that's about
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
moving costs when people are moving
 
01:48:06.290 --> 01:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
buildings you know we have a system
 
01:48:08.810 --> 01:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
right now that that is
 
01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:09.550 align:start position:0%
right now that that is
um

01:48:09.550 --> 01:48:09.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:13.129 --> 01:48:13.139 align:start position:0%
budgetarily based upon a presumption
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
that no one ever moves anywhere
 
01:48:17.689 --> 01:48:17.699 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:48:19.490 --> 01:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
which is a bad presumption if you want
 
01:48:21.050 --> 01:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
to fix buildings
 
01:48:24.290 --> 01:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
and so uh uh you know it's very hard I
 
01:48:25.609 --> 01:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
had a discussion with a very small
 
01:48:27.950 --> 01:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
agency the other day who said well you
 
01:48:29.330 --> 01:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
know our lease is expiring and we want
 
01:48:31.370 --> 01:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
to move here and I said how much money
 
01:48:32.570 --> 01:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
do you have for moving costs and they
 
01:48:34.010 --> 01:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
said we don't have any
 
01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
and I said and and the the director of
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
the agency said
 
01:48:42.169 --> 01:48:42.179 align:start position:0%
couldn't you just pay for it and I'm
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
like I'd have to ask my wife I don't I
 
01:48:46.450 --> 01:48:46.460 align:start position:0%
think it's going to work
 
01:48:49.609 --> 01:48:49.619 align:start position:0%
but it's um but it it's a it's an issue
 
01:48:54.050 --> 01:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
you do get an A for humor you know I I'm
 
01:48:55.850 --> 01:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
not sure that my entire staff would
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
agree with you on that but thank you so
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
the pleasure of the division
 
01:49:03.649 --> 01:49:03.659 align:start position:0%
again I know we do have some wiggle room
 
01:49:03.659 --> 01:49:05.330 align:start position:0%
again I know we do have some wiggle room
but

01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
we'll have to come back and look at what
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
we may have to Chisel away on as far as
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
the items that we have not
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
touch to represent McGuire yeah let me
 
01:49:18.250 --> 01:49:18.260 align:start position:0%
just ask the building maintenance fund
 
01:49:21.050 --> 01:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
uh sorry the building maintenance fund
 
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
does it have a certain amount it's not
 
01:49:24.830 --> 01:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
elapsing so it has a certain amount now
 
01:49:27.229 --> 01:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
how what's the throughput kind of of
 
01:49:30.410 --> 01:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
that um the throughput of that is meant
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
um let me do a 75 cent a square foot
 
01:49:36.590 --> 01:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
charge and I think it's roughly
 
01:49:41.090 --> 01:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
um 2.8 5.6 per biennium
 
01:49:43.729 --> 01:49:43.739 align:start position:0%
does that make sense and we're we're
 
01:49:45.530 --> 01:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
holding off on projects this year until
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
we know what's going to happen in the
 
01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
budget and whether we have to stretch or
 
01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
not stretch
 
01:49:52.370 --> 01:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
so the 5.6 per biennium this would be in
 
01:49:54.410 --> 01:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
addition to those things
 
01:49:57.050 --> 01:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
okay to to deal with maintenance that
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
hasn't been performed but should have
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
been the state and should have been as a
 
01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
by the beholder question the state if if
 
01:50:05.930 --> 01:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
I did a real deferred maintenance list
 
01:50:08.570 --> 01:50:08.580 align:start position:0%
it'd be about a billion dollars
 
01:50:11.149 --> 01:50:11.159 align:start position:0%
and so you know we hope to do two or
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
three million a year we're not really
 
01:50:13.810 --> 01:50:13.820 align:start position:0%
keeping up
 
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
we are going to
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
um in the course of the next six months
 
01:50:20.169 --> 01:50:20.179 align:start position:0%
is to a
 
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
professional survey of every building
 
01:50:27.770 --> 01:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
and identify with a with an independent
 
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
you know large corporations do this a
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
lot in the University system I think did
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
it where you have somebody come in and
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
look at all your systems and say end of
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
life five years from under life 10 years
 
01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
from under life you know when when
 
01:50:40.490 --> 01:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
should you expect to do something so we
 
01:50:42.530 --> 01:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
can be strategic instead of just
 
01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
whatever happens to get funded okay
 
01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you we have a long history of
 
01:50:48.290 --> 01:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance here at least the
 
01:50:49.850 --> 01:50:49.860 align:start position:0%
time I've been here it's always we'll do
 
01:50:52.250 --> 01:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
it next budget cycle and I think we've
 
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
so you are ready to move all these along
 
01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:01.170 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire right
 
01:51:01.170 --> 01:51:02.590 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire right
[Music]

01:51:02.590 --> 01:51:02.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
yeah sure on the division of Enterprise
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
App Management how does that relate to
 
01:51:13.250 --> 01:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
Erp and that's who runs the Erp
 
01:51:15.890 --> 01:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
it used to be called fdm which I think
 
01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
stood for financial data management
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
because the data was much more than
 
01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:20.470 align:start position:0%
because the data was much more than
financial

01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:51:22.970 --> 01:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
I think in the 80s it was just financial
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
data and that's when they created the
 
01:51:25.609 --> 01:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
name now it's called Enterprise
 
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
application so they managed New
 
01:51:29.390 --> 01:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first and it is it is it is
 
01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
that organization
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
the line item that you see in front of
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
you is not related to the project itself
 
01:51:37.250 --> 01:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
it really is just a keying error that
 
01:51:39.649 --> 01:51:39.659 align:start position:0%
occurred in in the budget so if you
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
looked at your budget page it looks like
 
01:51:42.350 --> 01:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
there's a Federal grant that's coming in
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
and it was just it was just keyed
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
incorrectly so that one is is a fix that
 
01:51:48.530 --> 01:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
we're asking for
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
well because we're under kind of a
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
deadline here we either need to move a
 
01:51:56.450 --> 01:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
couple of these or none or we could give
 
01:51:59.090 --> 01:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
the department some wiggle room was
 
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
giving them a flat amount and they could
 
01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
decide whether they needed for human
 
01:52:06.590 --> 01:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
resource coordinators make it two and
 
01:52:08.810 --> 01:52:08.820 align:start position:0%
one purchasing agent or
 
01:52:11.390 --> 01:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
and give them that Latitude
 
01:52:13.729 --> 01:52:13.739 align:start position:0%
to make that decision with just a sum
 
01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
amount but again looking for suggestions
 
01:52:20.090 --> 01:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
from the division represent McGuire all
 
01:52:21.649 --> 01:52:21.659 align:start position:0%
right I'm
 
01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm in favor of the big items
 
01:52:27.290 --> 01:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
more so than the than the positions
 
01:52:31.370 --> 01:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
because the positions often are
 
01:52:33.770 --> 01:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
um unfilled already there's other
 
01:52:37.070 --> 01:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
positions right I mean so you know
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
there's places to add people and just
 
01:52:41.149 --> 01:52:41.159 align:start position:0%
because if we have this position that
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
puts money that's may very well not get
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
spent so
 
01:52:49.609 --> 01:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
so you're looking at the 1.2 the 1.2 and
 
01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:01.129 --> 01:53:01.139 align:start position:0%
okay are we I think we'd be we'd be
 
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
um operationally very satisfied with
 
01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:06.470 align:start position:0%
um operationally very satisfied with
that

01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:07.970 --> 01:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
all right the rest of the division
 
01:53:10.490 --> 01:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
members okay with it I see thumbs up
 
01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:12.649 align:start position:0%
members okay with it I see thumbs up
okay

01:53:12.649 --> 01:53:12.659 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh appreciate your efforts and
 
01:53:17.689 --> 01:53:17.699 align:start position:0%
again uh
 
01:53:20.450 --> 01:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
respect your advice and
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
all right Melissa and Mike
 
01:53:35.149 --> 01:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
if those three items to add in and we'll
 
01:53:46.490 --> 01:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:58.189 --> 01:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:01.010 --> 01:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
we could if people are up to it we could
 
01:54:02.689 --> 01:54:02.699 align:start position:0%
certainly move but my guess is we'll
 
01:54:05.570 --> 01:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
just come back Monday okay Monday at 9
 
01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
30 and we'll hear those two retirement
 
01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
bills on Monday
 
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll have a better get that did you
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
because like Janet
 
01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
he wasn't in there but I can run in and
 
01:54:21.169 --> 01:54:21.179 align:start position:0%
schedule them yeah go over and make sure
 
01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
those two are scheduled
 
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:35.470 --> 01:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
and also put Tuesday as a word
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
because I noticed it wasn't in the
 
01:54:39.709 --> 01:54:39.719 align:start position:0%
calendars I want to make sure I'm
 
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
working an amendment to reduce the 84
 
01:54:48.790 --> 01:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:51.169 --> 01:54:51.179 align:start position:0%
commissioner how are you I'm wonderful
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
how are you good thanks like if you
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
could state your name for the record and
 
01:54:57.590 --> 01:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
identify the colleague next to you that
 
01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
would be helpful thank you uh Sarah
 
01:55:00.770 --> 01:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
Stewart commissioner of the Department
 
01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
of Natural and cultural resources and
 
01:55:05.570 --> 01:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
I'm with Chris Marino who oversees our
 
01:55:07.370 --> 01:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
office of administration
 
01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
I just want to remark that the last time
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
we were here representative McGuire you
 
01:55:13.970 --> 01:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
were wearing a Valentine's Day tie yeah
 
01:55:15.590 --> 01:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
and this time you're wearing a St
 
01:55:17.450 --> 01:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
Patrick's Day tie so I feel like we're
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
always celebrating a holiday when we're
 
01:55:28.689 --> 01:55:28.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:32.209 --> 01:55:32.219 align:start position:0%
at least it's not April Fool's Day yeah
 
01:55:32.219 --> 01:55:34.010 align:start position:0%
at least it's not April Fool's Day yeah
yeah

01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:55:34.020 --> 01:55:34.790 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
so we were before you on February 10th
 
01:55:39.410 --> 01:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
and I provided some overall remarks
 
01:55:41.570 --> 01:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
about our budget that was before the
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
governor issued his Budget on February
 
01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:45.290 align:start position:0%
governor issued his Budget on February
14th

01:55:45.290 --> 01:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
14th
 
01:55:48.109 --> 01:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know the headline is we're
 
01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
very happy with the governor's budget
 
01:55:52.669 --> 01:55:52.679 align:start position:0%
allocation for this agency we oversee
 
01:55:54.890 --> 01:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
five divisions as you'll recall Parks
 
01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:57.060 align:start position:0%
and Recreation the division of forests
 
01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
and lands the division of historical
 
01:56:01.129 --> 01:56:01.139 align:start position:0%
resources the State library and the New
 
01:56:03.770 --> 01:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Council on the Arts and
 
01:56:08.270 --> 01:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
we feel that um uh most of our requests
 
01:56:10.250 --> 01:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
for this next biennium have been
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
fulfilled in the governor's budget so
 
01:56:15.590 --> 01:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
today we're happy to tick through
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
um that budget with you answer specific
 
01:56:18.719 --> 01:56:19.970 align:start position:0%
um that budget with you answer specific
questions

01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:56:22.129 --> 01:56:22.139 align:start position:0%
um perhaps before we do I'll let Chris
 
01:56:24.910 --> 01:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
Marino just share a couple of small
 
01:56:27.229 --> 01:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
items that uh
 
01:56:29.209 --> 01:56:29.219 align:start position:0%
were not covered in the governor's
 
01:56:30.770 --> 01:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
budget but we wanted to bring to your
 
01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:32.390 align:start position:0%
budget but we wanted to bring to your
attention

01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:34.679 align:start position:0%
all right fire away good morning thank
 
01:56:37.850 --> 01:56:37.860 align:start position:0%
you uh just choose two items that uh we
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention that we're we're not
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
covered one in in one case is just a
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
small increase in our utility line uh
 
01:56:47.450 --> 01:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
for our service operations account for
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
150 000 and I will specify that uh
 
01:56:53.450 --> 01:56:53.460 align:start position:0%
provide a written specification for you
 
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
and the other item is a doit position
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
this is a position to support our agency
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
it is a management position
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
um currently the setup we have right now
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
is kind of left over from when we were
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
dread as you may recall we were split
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
into two separate departments however we
 
01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
still have one individual trying to uh
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
do Management Services for both
 
01:57:23.450 --> 01:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
departments and it has become a matter
 
01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:24.290 align:start position:0%
departments and it has become a matter
of

01:57:24.290 --> 01:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:57:26.450 --> 01:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh really just not being able to
 
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
maintain the level of service that we
 
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
need so we have sought to add a position
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
we've conferred with doit on this they
 
01:57:36.890 --> 01:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
are in support they are in agreement uh
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
however it was not uh included as part
 
01:57:41.330 --> 01:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
of the uh it was not accepted as part of
 
01:57:43.129 --> 01:57:43.139 align:start position:0%
the submission with the governor's
 
01:57:45.290 --> 01:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
budget we'd like to go ahead and request
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
to have that added to our budget as well
 
01:57:50.270 --> 01:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
and again I'll provide detailed
 
01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
information on the particular position
 
01:57:55.129 --> 01:57:55.139 align:start position:0%
uh and the the funding it would be
 
01:57:57.649 --> 01:57:57.659 align:start position:0%
General funding which is primarily well
 
01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
it would be an allocation of mixed funds
 
01:58:01.850 --> 01:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
when our department primarily General
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
funding but some other uh percentage of
 
01:58:06.649 --> 01:58:06.659 align:start position:0%
funds from agency income since it will
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
be servicing the entire department now
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
your budget starts on 601 could you tell
 
01:58:12.890 --> 01:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
us for the benefit of the LBA and
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
ourselves where that line would increase
 
01:58:19.970 --> 01:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
on what page perhaps sure uh well the it
 
01:58:21.729 --> 01:58:21.739 align:start position:0%
would increase within accounting unit
 
01:58:26.030 --> 01:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
29.82 which is on page
 
01:58:27.709 --> 01:58:27.719 align:start position:0%
I apologize
 
01:58:30.649 --> 01:58:30.659 align:start position:0%
the print went upside down
 
01:58:35.689 --> 01:58:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:35.699 --> 01:58:38.510 align:start position:0%
 
3401

01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
3401
 
01:58:41.930 --> 01:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh be page 603
 
01:58:45.649 --> 01:58:45.659 align:start position:0%
excuse me so under accounting unit 2982
 
01:58:49.310 --> 01:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
so what we'd be doing is adding an
 
01:58:53.689 --> 01:58:53.699 align:start position:0%
additional amount in that
 
01:58:57.530 --> 01:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
account to uh cover the cost of an
 
01:58:59.149 --> 01:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
additional position salary and benefits
 
01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
for an additional position
 
01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
and how much was that it's estimated to
 
01:59:07.209 --> 01:59:07.219 align:start position:0%
be approximately
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
combined salary and benefits a hundred
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
and eight thousand dollars in 24 and 114
 
01:59:17.930 --> 01:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:19.609 --> 01:59:19.619 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:59:22.370 --> 01:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman we have that on the second
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
page of our additional request doat also
 
01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
asks for this is one of their items okay
 
01:59:43.310 --> 01:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:58.070 --> 01:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:01.070 --> 02:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
a little more duplication
 
02:00:02.570 --> 02:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
all right thanks for pointing that out
 
02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:07.450 align:start position:0%
all right thanks for pointing that out
Michael

02:00:07.450 --> 02:00:07.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:10.250 --> 02:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
do you want to clarify
 
02:00:13.129 --> 02:00:13.139 align:start position:0%
uh that was all I had for additions that
 
02:00:14.810 --> 02:00:14.820 align:start position:0%
was all we had
 
02:00:16.490 --> 02:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
um there was one question that had come
 
02:00:19.490 --> 02:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
up uh in the prior session we had back
 
02:00:21.470 --> 02:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
on February 10th uh there had been a
 
02:00:23.930 --> 02:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
question uh by
 
02:00:26.510 --> 02:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
might have been representative McGuire
 
02:00:28.370 --> 02:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
um in any case it was a question about
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
the uh allocation of funds within the
 
02:00:32.990 --> 02:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office the question
 
02:00:35.089 --> 02:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
related to why there was a portion of
 
02:00:39.649 --> 02:00:39.659 align:start position:0%
agency income and increases uh so what I
 
02:00:40.910 --> 02:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to do was clarify unfortunately I
 
02:00:43.010 --> 02:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
was not able to make it at that time so
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
I wasn't there to assist but essentially
 
02:00:48.169 --> 02:00:48.179 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's office is comprised
 
02:00:49.850 --> 02:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
of a mix it's
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
we have within the Commissioner's Office
 
02:00:54.109 --> 02:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
functions such as the conservation plate
 
02:00:56.089 --> 02:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
fund which is nearly a million dollars
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
in other funding we also have the design
 
02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
development maintenance Group which is
 
02:01:04.810 --> 02:01:04.820 align:start position:0%
90 funded by uh agency income as well
 
02:01:08.089 --> 02:01:08.099 align:start position:0%
and we also have in that figure for the
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office the indirect cost
 
02:01:12.649 --> 02:01:12.659 align:start position:0%
which is allocated by the administrative
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
Services as part of the Statewide cost
 
02:01:16.850 --> 02:01:16.860 align:start position:0%
allocation plan so that figure is
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
identified as other income in that
 
02:01:20.689 --> 02:01:20.699 align:start position:0%
accounting unit as well so there are
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
other functions there's also I'm sorry
 
02:01:24.169 --> 02:01:24.179 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of historic sites as well
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
which is also currently funded with
 
02:01:28.729 --> 02:01:28.739 align:start position:0%
Parks funds
 
02:01:32.089 --> 02:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
all however we do have language in House
 
02:01:34.850 --> 02:01:34.860 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 that would draw a warrant to
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
allow that function to be put back under
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
a general fund a fund source which is
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
where it always has been except excuse
 
02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:44.089 align:start position:0%
where it always has been except excuse
me

02:01:44.089 --> 02:01:44.099 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:01:44.099 --> 02:01:45.410 align:start position:0%
me
correct

02:01:45.410 --> 02:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:01:47.709 --> 02:01:47.719 align:start position:0%
so hopefully that clarifies
 
02:01:51.169 --> 02:01:51.179 align:start position:0%
the mix of general and other funds
 
02:01:53.450 --> 02:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
within the Commissioner's Office yeah I
 
02:01:55.970 --> 02:01:55.980 align:start position:0%
see you do have a number of issues that
 
02:01:58.189 --> 02:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
we haven't touched on in House Bill 2
 
02:02:00.890 --> 02:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
summary we should go to House Bill 2
 
02:02:03.890 --> 02:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:06.290 --> 02:02:06.300 align:start position:0%
and we have the Christa McAuliffe which
 
02:02:07.850 --> 02:02:07.860 align:start position:0%
falls under your
 
02:02:12.050 --> 02:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and some others so Mr
 
02:02:17.330 --> 02:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:22.010 --> 02:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm looking at a couple but
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
should we start in the looks like that's
 
02:02:31.729 --> 02:02:31.739 align:start position:0%
on uh page 32 section 83 yeah okay
 
02:02:39.109 --> 02:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
yes and I believe that the governor's
 
02:02:43.790 --> 02:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
office is finalizing their committee
 
02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:45.589 align:start position:0%
office is finalizing their committee
membership

02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
membership
 
02:02:47.689 --> 02:02:47.699 align:start position:0%
list for that
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
um it allocates I believe is it a
 
02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
million 500 500 500 000 to commission
 
02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:54.950 align:start position:0%
million 500 500 500 000 to commission
um

02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:59.109 --> 02:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh an artist which would go out to bid
 
02:03:03.649 --> 02:03:03.659 align:start position:0%
to develop a memorial statue to honor
 
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
Krista McAuliffe on state house property
 
02:03:12.109 --> 02:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
and I would be on that committee uh as
 
02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
well as I believe the commissioner of
 
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
Das or designee
 
02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:17.450 align:start position:0%
Das or designee
um

02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:20.089 --> 02:03:20.099 align:start position:0%
some members of the public and appointed
 
02:03:23.930 --> 02:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:25.970 --> 02:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I do recall you
 
02:03:27.890 --> 02:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
had a question on this about maybe
 
02:03:31.729 --> 02:03:31.739 align:start position:0%
raising private funds or
 
02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't remember it too much I mean
 
02:03:34.500 --> 02:03:35.689 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't remember it too much I mean
I

02:03:35.689 --> 02:03:35.699 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
I heard it's hard to
 
02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:40.070 align:start position:0%
I heard it's hard to
um

02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
to justify this in my mind
 
02:03:42.719 --> 02:03:43.790 align:start position:0%
to justify this in my mind
um

02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
is is this something that
 
02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
um a charity could be made to to create
 
02:03:52.129 --> 02:03:52.139 align:start position:0%
there is language I believe in the
 
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
executive order that allows for
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
um private donations which is wonderful
 
02:04:00.290 --> 02:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
if you recall the most recent statue is
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
of Governor winant which is over in
 
02:04:06.050 --> 02:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
front of the State library and that was
 
02:04:09.290 --> 02:04:09.300 align:start position:0%
um that was a
 
02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
product of much fundraising the
 
02:04:16.070 --> 02:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
experience I heard was really tough to
 
02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:17.159 align:start position:0%
be honest
 
02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
um and so I think that the I I think
 
02:04:21.290 --> 02:04:21.300 align:start position:0%
that the governor wanted to make sure
 
02:04:23.629 --> 02:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
that it that it could be achievable by
 
02:04:26.030 --> 02:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
giving it this allocation and also
 
02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:27.589 align:start position:0%
giving it this allocation and also
welcoming

02:04:27.589 --> 02:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
welcoming
 
02:04:27.599 --> 02:04:29.270 align:start position:0%
welcoming
um

02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
donations from the public what was the
 
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
cost of the Winans statue and when was
 
02:04:35.089 --> 02:04:35.099 align:start position:0%
it spent
 
02:04:43.970 --> 02:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:46.850 --> 02:04:46.860 align:start position:0%
so a language in section 83 gives the
 
02:04:49.070 --> 02:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
authority to raise money to give some
 
02:04:51.470 --> 02:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
whatever start the process
 
02:04:53.689 --> 02:04:53.699 align:start position:0%
the actual Appropriations the negative
 
02:04:53.699 --> 02:04:54.530 align:start position:0%
the actual Appropriations the negative
four

02:04:54.530 --> 02:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
four
 
02:04:57.229 --> 02:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
so we could act on at least getting the
 
02:04:59.930 --> 02:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
things started in 83
 
02:05:02.030 --> 02:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
and then we can move to 84 and discuss
 
02:05:04.070 --> 02:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
whether the state wishes to put any
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
money okay it's a project we all came
 
02:05:11.209 --> 02:05:11.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:13.609 --> 02:05:13.619 align:start position:0%
so the appropriation you have a
 
02:05:16.129 --> 02:05:16.139 align:start position:0%
suggested amount organization McGuire or
 
02:05:19.609 --> 02:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
do you don't feel we should fund it
 
02:05:22.970 --> 02:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
can I just ask what you would estimate
 
02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
the cost for it would be so we haven't
 
02:05:28.189 --> 02:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
had this kind of just popped in front of
 
02:05:28.199 --> 02:05:28.970 align:start position:0%
had this kind of just popped in front of
us

02:05:28.970 --> 02:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:05:31.189 --> 02:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
um so we haven't had time to you know to
 
02:05:35.689 --> 02:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
get any cost estimations for what a
 
02:05:37.570 --> 02:05:37.580 align:start position:0%
current day
 
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
statue artist would charge
 
02:05:43.850 --> 02:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
um I'm told it would be north of five
 
02:05:46.010 --> 02:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars considering the
 
02:05:48.109 --> 02:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
you know if we're having it on a slab of
 
02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:50.219 align:start position:0%
marble or Granite you know there's a lot
 
02:05:52.910 --> 02:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
of things that need to go into it uh
 
02:05:57.050 --> 02:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
previous to Governor winant statues have
 
02:05:59.810 --> 02:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
not been put up recently on the state
 
02:06:01.609 --> 02:06:01.619 align:start position:0%
house there are six statues including
 
02:06:03.410 --> 02:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
Governor weinert
 
02:06:06.530 --> 02:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
um and I think before the that most
 
02:06:07.850 --> 02:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
recent one it was like a hundred years
 
02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
before so I think prices have changed
 
02:06:12.589 --> 02:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
since then I'm guessing
 
02:06:15.530 --> 02:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
um but uh part of the the job of this
 
02:06:17.209 --> 02:06:17.219 align:start position:0%
committee will be to do some of that
 
02:06:20.510 --> 02:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
research and come up with
 
02:06:22.669 --> 02:06:22.679 align:start position:0%
um you know the parameters of What
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
expenses this should be
 
02:06:28.129 --> 02:06:28.139 align:start position:0%
is the committee itself uh entirely
 
02:06:30.109 --> 02:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
volunteers and this money is strictly
 
02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
for correct okay
 
02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:35.209 align:start position:0%
for correct okay
yeah maybe

02:06:35.209 --> 02:06:35.219 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe
 
02:06:35.219 --> 02:06:37.310 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe
um

02:06:37.310 --> 02:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:40.490 --> 02:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know I I'm still I I would like
 
02:06:42.430 --> 02:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
to see that there's significant
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
fundraising from others before we add
 
02:06:49.550 --> 02:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
um taxpayer funds so
 
02:06:52.609 --> 02:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
so I would just move to remove section
 
02:06:52.619 --> 02:06:54.410 align:start position:0%
so I would just move to remove section
84.

02:06:54.410 --> 02:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
84.
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
comments from the division
 
02:06:59.330 --> 02:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you Mr chair I
 
02:07:01.490 --> 02:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
agree with representative McGuire uh
 
02:07:03.709 --> 02:07:03.719 align:start position:0%
again I think it's the
 
02:07:06.350 --> 02:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
we need to get more details let the
 
02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
establish the com the committee for them
 
02:07:11.209 --> 02:07:11.219 align:start position:0%
to come up with some figures and some
 
02:07:11.219 --> 02:07:12.890 align:start position:0%
to come up with some figures and some
numbers

02:07:12.890 --> 02:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:13.490 align:start position:0%
numbers
um

02:07:13.490 --> 02:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
do we have any idea about any of the
 
02:07:27.790 --> 02:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
costs for the design for the governors
 
02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:29.450 align:start position:0%
costs for the design for the governors
Winans

02:07:29.450 --> 02:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
Winans
 
02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
statute out there there's any numbers on
 
02:07:33.470 --> 02:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
there you said it was like a million for
 
02:07:35.209 --> 02:07:35.219 align:start position:0%
the whole I can get those I'm sure
 
02:07:37.310 --> 02:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
they're all documented and since it was
 
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
a recent project I can find those for
 
02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:40.669 align:start position:0%
a recent project I can find those for
you

02:07:40.669 --> 02:07:40.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:07:42.530 --> 02:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
no and that could be the starting point
 
02:07:44.030 --> 02:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
of this committee's work
 
02:07:46.070 --> 02:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
yeah speaking for myself I would agree
 
02:07:48.410 --> 02:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
with representing Kimbrell's and McGuire
 
02:07:51.470 --> 02:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
but just one person here any other
 
02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:53.109 align:start position:0%
but just one person here any other
thoughts

02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
02:07:55.850 --> 02:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
yes represent kimbrells thank you Mr
 
02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
chair yeah what I was thinking was if
 
02:08:00.410 --> 02:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
they at least had a night and I the
 
02:08:02.209 --> 02:08:02.219 align:start position:0%
rough idea of what the design element
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
would cost maybe we could fund that
 
02:08:07.550 --> 02:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
portion but I wouldn't fund 500 000
 
02:08:10.910 --> 02:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
without knowing so if they could say the
 
02:08:12.770 --> 02:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
designer would cost twenty five thousand
 
02:08:14.750 --> 02:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
dollars whatever then maybe we could
 
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate that amount but the 500 is
 
02:08:19.310 --> 02:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
an odd starter for me
 
02:08:22.370 --> 02:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
all right everybody okay with that
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
all right uh Melissa Mr Hoffman please
 
02:08:30.410 --> 02:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
all right there were some others that I
 
02:08:35.629 --> 02:08:35.639 align:start position:0%
saw that caught my attention Mr Hoffman
 
02:08:38.030 --> 02:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
and a couple more in there
 
02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:39.109 align:start position:0%
and a couple more in there
um

02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:42.250 --> 02:08:42.260 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the State Library
 
02:08:49.010 --> 02:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
97 and 98 or the next page 30 page 36.
 
02:08:51.169 --> 02:08:51.179 align:start position:0%
I'd like to discuss that yes thank you
 
02:08:54.950 --> 02:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
so the State library is an historic
 
02:08:57.770 --> 02:08:57.780 align:start position:0%
building I hope you've all been there
 
02:09:03.229 --> 02:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
um and it it will never be fully a
 
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
climate controlled facility for the
 
02:09:09.470 --> 02:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
preservation of the books and documents
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
that are charged uh to the library from
 
02:09:15.410 --> 02:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
for management and protection
 
02:09:18.109 --> 02:09:18.119 align:start position:0%
over the years we have
 
02:09:20.689 --> 02:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
um you know quarantined some of the
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
special books in a more climate
 
02:09:25.490 --> 02:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
controlled area of the library
 
02:09:27.410 --> 02:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
um but but it would be a huge
 
02:09:29.390 --> 02:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
undertaking to
 
02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
um to fully uh
 
02:09:35.570 --> 02:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
redo the air quality in that building
 
02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
many many libraries in New Hampshire but
 
02:09:39.890 --> 02:09:39.900 align:start position:0%
also across the country are recognizing
 
02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
that in order to stay relevant they need
 
02:09:42.719 --> 02:09:44.109 align:start position:0%
that in order to stay relevant they need
to

02:09:44.109 --> 02:09:44.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
connect more with the needs of the
 
02:09:48.109 --> 02:09:48.119 align:start position:0%
community this is what a lot of your
 
02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
local public libraries have done and
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
very successfully and so the State
 
02:09:57.109 --> 02:09:57.119 align:start position:0%
library is looking to to become more of
 
02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
a public-facing facility state-owned
 
02:10:02.510 --> 02:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
facility here right next to the state
 
02:10:04.070 --> 02:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
house where fourth graders show up
 
02:10:07.129 --> 02:10:07.139 align:start position:0%
almost on a daily basis these days and
 
02:10:09.350 --> 02:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
where the public comes from not only all
 
02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
over New Hampshire but all over the
 
02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
country to tour our state capital
 
02:10:17.649 --> 02:10:17.659 align:start position:0%
uh the idea here and what we've already
 
02:10:22.550 --> 02:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
begun is working with uh Das and the
 
02:10:24.350 --> 02:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Works division of
 
02:10:26.270 --> 02:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
Public Works who have assigned a project
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
manager to um to work with
 
02:10:32.750 --> 02:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
um some professionals who can assess the
 
02:10:35.149 --> 02:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
stacks of books in the library currently
 
02:10:38.089 --> 02:10:38.099 align:start position:0%
and determine which ones we we are by
 
02:10:40.030 --> 02:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
RSA required to
 
02:10:43.490 --> 02:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
maintain for the public which ones might
 
02:10:48.530 --> 02:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
be donated or outdated and which ones we
 
02:10:51.890 --> 02:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
should move to a climate secured storage
 
02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:53.709 align:start position:0%
should move to a climate secured storage
facility

02:10:53.709 --> 02:10:53.719 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:10:57.410 --> 02:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
and tag with an electronic number that
 
02:10:59.570 --> 02:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
can we can then you know find it easily
 
02:11:02.450 --> 02:11:02.460 align:start position:0%
as needed for the public it would not
 
02:11:05.930 --> 02:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
compromise our customer service it would
 
02:11:09.050 --> 02:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
not compromise the interlibrary loan
 
02:11:11.169 --> 02:11:11.179 align:start position:0%
system function Etc all the all the
 
02:11:13.490 --> 02:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
expected customer service projects that
 
02:11:16.070 --> 02:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
the library undertakes it what it would
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
do is free up some space in the actual
 
02:11:23.330 --> 02:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
building and allow our agency to do some
 
02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
programmatic work to showcase our
 
02:11:29.689 --> 02:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
archeology lab findings to have a
 
02:11:32.629 --> 02:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
gallery night For Young Artists in New
 
02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to you know a variety of of
 
02:11:41.050 --> 02:11:41.060 align:start position:0%
valuable experiences that our agency
 
02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
would like to fulfill in a more
 
02:11:44.930 --> 02:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
public-facing way
 
02:11:47.930 --> 02:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
so the governor allocated the million
 
02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
dollars to take this first step which is
 
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
hiring the professionals to assess the
 
02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:54.609 align:start position:0%
hiring the professionals to assess the
spatial

02:11:54.609 --> 02:11:54.619 align:start position:0%
spatial
 
02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
situation at the library with the books
 
02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
and then actually do something with
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
their recommendation which would be to
 
02:12:04.370 --> 02:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
take out some of the books and put them
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
in climate-controlled storage that can
 
02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
that can be managed by our library staff
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
and free up that space in the library so
 
02:12:13.729 --> 02:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
this is a continuation of the work we've
 
02:12:13.739 --> 02:12:17.209 align:start position:0%
this is a continuation of the work we've
initiated

02:12:17.209 --> 02:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:18.770 --> 02:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
questions for the commissioner
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire where is the
 
02:12:23.689 --> 02:12:23.699 align:start position:0%
library in house bill one
 
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:00.490 --> 02:13:00.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:03.229 --> 02:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
and you'll notice
 
02:13:05.930 --> 02:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
there's the general fund thank you the
 
02:13:07.850 --> 02:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
general fund component
 
02:13:10.669 --> 02:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
Accounting in a two five five one
 
02:13:12.890 --> 02:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
okay and then the other substantial is
 
02:13:18.709 --> 02:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:18.719 --> 02:13:19.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:13:19.790 --> 02:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:24.350 --> 02:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
two million I'm on page 664. so the
 
02:13:25.970 --> 02:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
grand total for the State library is
 
02:13:28.609 --> 02:13:28.619 align:start position:0%
roughly two million dollars a year
 
02:13:30.709 --> 02:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
of General funds
 
02:13:32.810 --> 02:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
and there's a similar amount of federal
 
02:13:32.820 --> 02:13:34.129 align:start position:0%
and there's a similar amount of federal
funds

02:13:34.129 --> 02:13:34.139 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:13:37.790 --> 02:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:41.689 --> 02:13:41.699 align:start position:0%
right yes although that is uh
 
02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
yes approximately two million dollars in
 
02:13:45.530 --> 02:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
general funds yes
 
02:13:49.069 --> 02:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
so this would be like a 25 increase
 
02:13:52.069 --> 02:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
in the cost of the library this would be
 
02:13:53.569 --> 02:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
very separate from their day-to-day
 
02:13:53.579 --> 02:13:54.950 align:start position:0%
very separate from their day-to-day
operations

02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
operations
 
02:13:57.250 --> 02:13:57.260 align:start position:0%
um sure this would be a special project
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
that I
 
02:14:02.330 --> 02:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
believe would then serve beyond the
 
02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
current scope of work that the library
 
02:14:07.550 --> 02:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
is physically able to conduct at their
 
02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:09.109 align:start position:0%
is physically able to conduct at their
building

02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
building
 
02:14:12.290 --> 02:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:15.709 --> 02:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
what is the cost of this storage
 
02:14:18.589 --> 02:14:18.599 align:start position:0%
do we yeah go ahead so our state
 
02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
librarian Michael York has been talking
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
to other communities that have done
 
02:14:23.530 --> 02:14:23.540 align:start position:0%
similar projects
 
02:14:26.689 --> 02:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
UNH has did this a number of years ago
 
02:14:31.490 --> 02:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
so he has been working with DPW to to
 
02:14:34.250 --> 02:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
share some of these estimates
 
02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
um the the million dollars is on the low
 
02:14:42.850 --> 02:14:42.860 align:start position:0%
bar I think of uh of the technology
 
02:14:46.490 --> 02:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
portion of the project however until we
 
02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
have this assessment of needs
 
02:14:53.209 --> 02:14:53.219 align:start position:0%
we're not I don't know how it's how
 
02:14:56.990 --> 02:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
large a project this might become my
 
02:14:59.390 --> 02:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
hope is the million dollars will get us
 
02:15:02.810 --> 02:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
moving in this direction and we can do a
 
02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
phased approach that we can work through
 
02:15:06.050 --> 02:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
some programming
 
02:15:08.209 --> 02:15:08.219 align:start position:0%
um a pilot programs at the State Library
 
02:15:10.430 --> 02:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
while we've moved some books out there's
 
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
going to be some painting needs and some
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
you know maybe let new lighting or
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
whatever in some of the spaces of the
 
02:15:18.290 --> 02:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
library that currently just hold books
 
02:15:20.510 --> 02:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of moving Parts but the
 
02:15:22.850 --> 02:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
hope is not to let this project stall
 
02:15:26.589 --> 02:15:26.599 align:start position:0%
after we get the DPW project management
 
02:15:29.089 --> 02:15:29.099 align:start position:0%
assessment achieved we want to keep
 
02:15:31.609 --> 02:15:31.619 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
02:15:33.169 --> 02:15:33.179 align:start position:0%
yeah let me ask you a slightly different
 
02:15:35.390 --> 02:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
way how much of the million dollars goes
 
02:15:37.250 --> 02:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
to the consultant who will assess the
 
02:15:38.330 --> 02:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
book none
 
02:15:40.850 --> 02:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
we already have the money
 
02:15:43.010 --> 02:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
to pay for the Consultants who are
 
02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:44.109 align:start position:0%
to pay for the Consultants who are
already

02:15:44.109 --> 02:15:44.119 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:15:48.970 --> 02:15:48.980 align:start position:0%
dpws already doing an rfq4 and will you
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
digitize all the material that gets
 
02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
stored not necessarily we are always
 
02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:56.149 align:start position:0%
stored not necessarily we are always
digitizing

02:15:56.149 --> 02:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
digitizing
 
02:15:59.330 --> 02:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
um our our books and paperwork and
 
02:16:01.010 --> 02:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
records at the State library and we give
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
out a ton of Grants around the state for
 
02:16:05.149 --> 02:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
local libraries to do the same but a lot
 
02:16:07.790 --> 02:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
of the books we are going to say is
 
02:16:11.569 --> 02:16:11.579 align:start position:0%
books and will be then stored in a
 
02:16:13.790 --> 02:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
climate controlled facility but we do
 
02:16:16.729 --> 02:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
regularly constantly digitize
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
but we're not going to digitize
 
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
everything and
 
02:16:22.370 --> 02:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
that's that's just an ongoing
 
02:16:24.609 --> 02:16:24.619 align:start position:0%
maintenance project the digital
 
02:16:27.890 --> 02:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
digitization so so if someone had a
 
02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
request for something that was stored in
 
02:16:31.850 --> 02:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
this facility there's a way to go ask
 
02:16:34.310 --> 02:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment to go remove it promptly
 
02:16:37.549 --> 02:16:37.559 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
02:16:40.129 --> 02:16:40.139 align:start position:0%
yeah I I just don't know how to how do I
 
02:16:40.139 --> 02:16:42.889 align:start position:0%
yeah I I just don't know how to how do I
evaluate

02:16:42.889 --> 02:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
evaluate
 
02:16:44.990 --> 02:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm getting for a million dollars
 
02:16:48.049 --> 02:16:48.059 align:start position:0%
in the sense that you know it's not you
 
02:16:49.549 --> 02:16:49.559 align:start position:0%
didn't say a thousand books will be
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
stored or uh you know some kind of I
 
02:16:54.530 --> 02:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
would say more than a thousand books
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
um to free up the space of the State
 
02:16:58.610 --> 02:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
Library I would love to take this group
 
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
on a field trip at the State library and
 
02:17:03.530 --> 02:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
do a tour to show you the um untapped
 
02:17:05.330 --> 02:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity that I believe exists in
 
02:17:07.250 --> 02:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
such a beautiful building
 
02:17:09.169 --> 02:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
um not many people
 
02:17:12.349 --> 02:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
go from their car into the State Library
 
02:17:14.270 --> 02:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
they go to the state house but they
 
02:17:15.709 --> 02:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
don't and that's a shame and I think
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
that it's a beautiful State Building
 
02:17:20.089 --> 02:17:20.099 align:start position:0%
that our just to start with our agency
 
02:17:22.490 --> 02:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
could bring to life with the talent that
 
02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:23.629 align:start position:0%
could bring to life with the talent that
we

02:17:23.629 --> 02:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:17:26.150 --> 02:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
um that we have in our in our agency and
 
02:17:29.270 --> 02:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
beyond that we could expand but I think
 
02:17:32.570 --> 02:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
it could be a wonderful place that's you
 
02:17:35.810 --> 02:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
know open week evenings for uh for the
 
02:17:40.129 --> 02:17:40.139 align:start position:0%
public to enjoy various programming
 
02:17:40.139 --> 02:17:43.750 align:start position:0%
public to enjoy various programming
foreign

02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:46.849 --> 02:17:46.859 align:start position:0%
question I have on this uh are there any
 
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
of these books that you're looking at
 
02:17:50.750 --> 02:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
that are at risk oh yes of damage and
 
02:17:52.610 --> 02:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
could be lost absolutely follow through
 
02:17:54.709 --> 02:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
with this absolutely that is that that's
 
02:17:56.990 --> 02:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
sort of the the patchwork quilt approach
 
02:17:59.629 --> 02:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
has been um doing okay at the State
 
02:18:02.330 --> 02:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
library but it's not uh we're not
 
02:18:06.589 --> 02:18:06.599 align:start position:0%
confident that that approach is truly
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
um protecting
 
02:18:10.429 --> 02:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
the most valuable paper products that
 
02:18:12.650 --> 02:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
are in that building so yes they are at
 
02:18:14.870 --> 02:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
risk representative evil please thank
 
02:18:16.669 --> 02:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
you I'm
 
02:18:18.770 --> 02:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
I'm word of this section and this
 
02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:20.270 align:start position:0%
I'm word of this section and this
appropriation

02:18:20.270 --> 02:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
02:18:22.910 --> 02:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
um I I know what the State library has
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
been going through just from the public
 
02:18:28.190 --> 02:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
works side of things I also saw
 
02:18:30.650 --> 02:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
a real mess that we got into with the
 
02:18:32.929 --> 02:18:32.939 align:start position:0%
state archives neglecting some of our
 
02:18:35.209 --> 02:18:35.219 align:start position:0%
historic documents
 
02:18:37.370 --> 02:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
um I think there are many valuable
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
things that should not be neglected
 
02:18:43.790 --> 02:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
the library is beautiful and it also
 
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like you're trying to bring
 
02:18:48.650 --> 02:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
its programs more into the 21st century
 
02:18:51.049 --> 02:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
so that you can reach a greater
 
02:18:53.389 --> 02:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
population within the state so that they
 
02:18:55.849 --> 02:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
can benefit what's in the in the library
 
02:18:59.330 --> 02:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
so I especially since you've started the
 
02:19:01.610 --> 02:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
process again because of what I've seen
 
02:19:03.950 --> 02:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
with the archives the patchwork quilt
 
02:19:06.290 --> 02:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
effect doesn't really work and I think
 
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
we should appropriate the million
 
02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:10.610 align:start position:0%
we should appropriate the million
dollars

02:19:10.610 --> 02:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:16.610 --> 02:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:18.530 --> 02:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
yes representative cambrell's please
 
02:19:20.810 --> 02:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair being that we are a
 
02:19:22.669 --> 02:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
finance committee and I know you can't
 
02:19:25.730 --> 02:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
probably put a price on these these
 
02:19:27.770 --> 02:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
Treasures that we're storing but if you
 
02:19:30.169 --> 02:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
were to put sell these on say a private
 
02:19:31.969 --> 02:19:31.979 align:start position:0%
Market what would be the worth of all
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
these these these words millions and
 
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars we have books that
 
02:19:40.310 --> 02:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
are you know signed by authors from a
 
02:19:42.770 --> 02:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
long time ago there's a ring in the
 
02:19:45.889 --> 02:19:45.899 align:start position:0%
library that is like jeweled and amazing
 
02:19:48.650 --> 02:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
we can't we don't have the ability right
 
02:19:50.570 --> 02:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
now to properly show showcase it
 
02:19:52.310 --> 02:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
publicly it'd be nice to have it under
 
02:19:54.650 --> 02:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
like a museum quality box for the public
 
02:19:57.170 --> 02:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
to see but we can't we don't have that
 
02:19:58.849 --> 02:19:58.859 align:start position:0%
ability at the State library right now
 
02:20:01.370 --> 02:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
so good question there's a there's a lot
 
02:20:04.250 --> 02:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
of very valuable Treasures that are sort
 
02:20:05.929 --> 02:20:05.939 align:start position:0%
of hidden and tucked away and our
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
mission is to provide access to these
 
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
um so I don't feel we're fulfilling our
 
02:20:13.730 --> 02:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
mission by tucking away a lot of the
 
02:20:15.710 --> 02:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
stuff that we should Showcase in a safe
 
02:20:25.370 --> 02:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
and probably one of the two
 
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives that have spent a lot of
 
02:20:32.170 --> 02:20:32.180 align:start position:0%
time over in the library
 
02:20:35.410 --> 02:20:35.420 align:start position:0%
doing research
 
02:20:38.270 --> 02:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
it worked out well because
 
02:20:40.849 --> 02:20:40.859 align:start position:0%
between committee meetings if I had a
 
02:20:42.650 --> 02:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
couple hours to kill I could go over
 
02:20:42.660 --> 02:20:43.550 align:start position:0%
couple hours to kill I could go over
there

02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:20:46.910 --> 02:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's a beautiful building
 
02:20:46.920 --> 02:20:48.170 align:start position:0%
it's a beautiful building
um

02:20:48.170 --> 02:20:48.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:50.750 --> 02:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
there's there's unbelievable resources
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
in there I'm sure of it
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
I just shared a representative
 
02:21:00.110 --> 02:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
but why is
 
02:21:03.530 --> 02:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
concern about getting my hands on the
 
02:21:05.929 --> 02:21:05.939 align:start position:0%
million dollars I'm saying
 
02:21:08.570 --> 02:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
where is it going or what are we getting
 
02:21:11.929 --> 02:21:11.939 align:start position:0%
for it and it's to me it's a big number
 
02:21:14.990 --> 02:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
I know it today it seems to be a
 
02:21:17.210 --> 02:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
millionaire and a million there but I
 
02:21:20.690 --> 02:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:22.610 --> 02:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
there's representative McGuire thank you
 
02:21:24.530 --> 02:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
there's a different million dollars that
 
02:21:26.270 --> 02:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
I want to remove
 
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
um from this area so maybe we should
 
02:21:30.849 --> 02:21:30.859 align:start position:0%
consider that one first
 
02:21:34.429 --> 02:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
and then come back to this one it's
 
02:21:37.550 --> 02:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
public television oh
 
02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:38.870 align:start position:0%
public television oh
yeah

02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:21:43.370 --> 02:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
public television
 
02:21:48.650 --> 02:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
well I I would just say if there's that
 
02:21:50.570 --> 02:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
concern there's a difference between
 
02:21:53.150 --> 02:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
zero dollars and a million dollars I
 
02:21:56.389 --> 02:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
mean maybe we could come up with a
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
some amount because I think excuse me
 
02:22:01.370 --> 02:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
we're hiding our light under a bushel
 
02:22:03.650 --> 02:22:03.660 align:start position:0%
basket here and it's almost like our
 
02:22:06.650 --> 02:22:06.660 align:start position:0%
state museum in a way
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
I just think that we haven't put enough
 
02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
money into the wonderful value that we
 
02:22:13.849 --> 02:22:13.859 align:start position:0%
have there I'd like to stick with the
 
02:22:16.309 --> 02:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
million but I don't think we should zero
 
02:22:18.349 --> 02:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
this out if there's concern about it
 
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
well we just we just removed 500 000
 
02:22:23.990 --> 02:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
from the McAuliffe line we could
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
compromise to a half a million dollars
 
02:22:29.090 --> 02:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
would that be okay with everybody or
 
02:22:29.100 --> 02:22:33.950 align:start position:0%
would that be okay with everybody or
7.50

02:22:33.950 --> 02:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:36.170 --> 02:22:36.180 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin for those who
 
02:22:38.030 --> 02:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
don't know he's quite a historian he's
 
02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
got like millions of license plate well
 
02:22:42.410 --> 02:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands probably right
 
02:22:45.650 --> 02:22:45.660 align:start position:0%
could have a license plate yeah there
 
02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
you go that's what I kind of thought
 
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
put them in somewhere in the in the
 
02:22:52.429 --> 02:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
belly of that building
 
02:22:55.730 --> 02:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
is all the original listings of
 
02:22:58.010 --> 02:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
of who who
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
owned what car yeah in the registration
 
02:23:01.439 --> 02:23:02.630 align:start position:0%
owned what car yeah in the registration
numbers

02:23:02.630 --> 02:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
it was originally state law that that
 
02:23:07.610 --> 02:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
had to be all published
 
02:23:11.150 --> 02:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm pretty sure that
 
02:23:13.490 --> 02:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
they all sit down the belly of the
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
building somewhere so naturally
 
02:23:19.070 --> 02:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
the uh the federal government passed the
 
02:23:21.370 --> 02:23:21.380 align:start position:0%
law and like the seventies that
 
02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
restricted access to some of that
 
02:23:26.929 --> 02:23:26.939 align:start position:0%
information so I have my own private
 
02:23:29.389 --> 02:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
library of it you do bring up a good
 
02:23:30.770 --> 02:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
point though because there is a basement
 
02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
and a sub basement at the State library
 
02:23:35.330 --> 02:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
and the State library is located on
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
Spring Street and it's named Spring
 
02:23:40.250 --> 02:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
Street because there is a spring and we
 
02:23:40.260 --> 02:23:41.090 align:start position:0%
Street because there is a spring and we
have

02:23:41.090 --> 02:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:23:44.389 --> 02:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
that as a challenge as well that at that
 
02:23:48.650 --> 02:23:48.660 align:start position:0%
building so to have a thorough calling
 
02:23:52.969 --> 02:23:52.979 align:start position:0%
of the of the the books and and the
 
02:23:54.650 --> 02:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
valuables you know the there's there's
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
books there that are you know 1957 birds
 
02:23:59.210 --> 02:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
of Africa
 
02:24:01.969 --> 02:24:01.979 align:start position:0%
and then next to it is you know the town
 
02:24:05.570 --> 02:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
records of Peterborough so we we could
 
02:24:05.580 --> 02:24:06.889 align:start position:0%
records of Peterborough so we we could
use

02:24:06.889 --> 02:24:06.899 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:24:09.170 --> 02:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
um the professional assessment so that
 
02:24:12.889 --> 02:24:12.899 align:start position:0%
we can take what we want to preserve for
 
02:24:15.469 --> 02:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
future generations and and keep it
 
02:24:17.870 --> 02:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
accessible and get rid of some of the
 
02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
the stuff that
 
02:24:22.429 --> 02:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
you know we we are not the the RSA
 
02:24:24.650 --> 02:24:24.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't mandate the State library to
 
02:24:28.250 --> 02:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
maintain and then we have some of a
 
02:24:30.349 --> 02:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
blank canvas in some of the space in
 
02:24:31.610 --> 02:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
that library and that's where I get
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
excited it's not just a million dollars
 
02:24:36.170 --> 02:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
for a box to put the books in it's a
 
02:24:39.530 --> 02:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars that will allow us to
 
02:24:39.540 --> 02:24:40.849 align:start position:0%
million dollars that will allow us to
um

02:24:40.849 --> 02:24:40.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
to connect with the public and that's
 
02:24:47.389 --> 02:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:50.210 --> 02:24:50.220 align:start position:0%
represent grassy please yeah I've I've
 
02:24:52.490 --> 02:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
been through this before in the city of
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
Rochester we've had numerous document
 
02:24:56.990 --> 02:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
City documents that were stored in a
 
02:24:59.090 --> 02:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
sub-basement area and when we went down
 
02:25:00.590 --> 02:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
there thinking that everything was fine
 
02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
it was in very difficult shape and one
 
02:25:06.170 --> 02:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
of the things in order to be able to
 
02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
um to to to save those documents the
 
02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
cost was far more expensive in the long
 
02:25:12.780 --> 02:25:13.730 align:start position:0%
cost was far more expensive in the long
run

02:25:13.730 --> 02:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
run
 
02:25:16.130 --> 02:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
um to save them than it was if we had
 
02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
preserved them in the short term and
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
that's why I think this you know this
 
02:25:21.590 --> 02:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars or you know something
 
02:25:23.389 --> 02:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
that's closer to the million dollars is
 
02:25:24.770 --> 02:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
probably something we should look at
 
02:25:26.870 --> 02:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
because if we don't in three to five
 
02:25:28.670 --> 02:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
years they're going to be back here and
 
02:25:30.050 --> 02:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be that it's going to
 
02:25:32.450 --> 02:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
be a million dollars it's going to be uh
 
02:25:34.849 --> 02:25:34.859 align:start position:0%
oh we need 10 million dollars or these
 
02:25:36.889 --> 02:25:36.899 align:start position:0%
documents are just going to disappear
 
02:25:42.770 --> 02:25:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
so we've seen have gotten to a point
 
02:25:47.570 --> 02:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
that there's some support for something
 
02:25:49.730 --> 02:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
now where did the million dollar
 
02:25:52.010 --> 02:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
piece come from is that did you get an
 
02:25:53.750 --> 02:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
estimate or is that something that you
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
folks just put together yourselves so we
 
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
when we had the chance to talk to the
 
02:26:03.290 --> 02:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
governor's office about this originally
 
02:26:05.210 --> 02:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
um we shared and don't have it in front
 
02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
of me and I apologize we shared examples
 
02:26:08.750 --> 02:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
of other local libraries throughout New
 
02:26:09.830 --> 02:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who have gone through a
 
02:26:11.870 --> 02:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
similar process
 
02:26:14.270 --> 02:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
um I believe golf sound Peterborough
 
02:26:17.330 --> 02:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
just said an addition but that's not
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're talking about Michael
 
02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
York went through and he estimated
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 8 and 15 million
 
02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
dollars if we were going to do it all at
 
02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:27.349 align:start position:0%
dollars if we were going to do it all at
once

02:26:27.349 --> 02:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
once
 
02:26:29.090 --> 02:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
based on the recommendations that we're
 
02:26:31.010 --> 02:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
already paying for for a professional
 
02:26:33.290 --> 02:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
assessment to take those recommendations
 
02:26:36.670 --> 02:26:36.680 align:start position:0%
and achieve everything all at once
 
02:26:39.830 --> 02:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
I like the million dollars because it's
 
02:26:42.550 --> 02:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
significant enough that we have forward
 
02:26:46.190 --> 02:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
momentum on this and we can
 
02:26:48.410 --> 02:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
um take the recommendations that we're
 
02:26:50.330 --> 02:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
going to get from the consultants and
 
02:26:52.969 --> 02:26:52.979 align:start position:0%
have a real serious conversation with
 
02:26:55.309 --> 02:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
you know go out to bid request for
 
02:26:58.670 --> 02:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
qualifications type of company to help
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
us establish the next step
 
02:27:03.230 --> 02:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
um so it's lower than what we believe
 
02:27:05.450 --> 02:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
the overall project would be but it gets
 
02:27:08.090 --> 02:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
us I think to continue the movement
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
towards the end goal
 
02:27:11.510 --> 02:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
so somebody like to move an amount
 
02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:14.389 align:start position:0%
so somebody like to move an amount
please

02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:19.849 --> 02:27:19.859 align:start position:0%
I'd like to move 750 000 plus tour
 
02:27:21.889 --> 02:27:21.899 align:start position:0%
okay it's been moved and second is there
 
02:27:24.770 --> 02:27:24.780 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the 750
 
02:27:27.469 --> 02:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
000 in a tour on probably April Fool's
 
02:27:30.590 --> 02:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
Day right so McGuire so
 
02:27:35.950 --> 02:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:38.809 --> 02:27:38.819 align:start position:0%
so a show of hands if you're in favor of
 
02:27:40.730 --> 02:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
the 750
 
02:27:43.550 --> 02:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
All rights Union Yes okay is there
 
02:27:46.730 --> 02:27:46.740 align:start position:0%
anything else uh Melissa Mr Hoffman
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
for them and House Bill too yes I think
 
02:27:54.410 --> 02:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
um page 85 sections 266
 
02:27:56.990 --> 02:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
there's a state Historic Site funds
 
02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:06.230 align:start position:0%
there's a state Historic Site funds
appropriation

02:28:06.230 --> 02:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:08.090 --> 02:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
so this is an item that we brought to
 
02:28:09.650 --> 02:28:09.660 align:start position:0%
your attention when I was here on the
 
02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:10.610 align:start position:0%
your attention when I was here on the
10th

02:28:10.610 --> 02:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
10th
 
02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
since its conception the Bureau of
 
02:28:15.710 --> 02:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
historic sites has been generally funded
 
02:28:18.469 --> 02:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
that was a strategic decision to make
 
02:28:21.290 --> 02:28:21.300 align:start position:0%
sure our historic sites the maintenance
 
02:28:24.050 --> 02:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
and the accessibility didn't fall below
 
02:28:28.610 --> 02:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:28.620 --> 02:28:29.929 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:28:29.929 --> 02:28:29.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:32.389 --> 02:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
and then when we had to
 
02:28:35.330 --> 02:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
cut the cutter budget
 
02:28:39.590 --> 02:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
um one biennium ago we did not want to
 
02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
cut the funding for the his the bureau
 
02:28:45.530 --> 02:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
so the parks
 
02:28:45.540 --> 02:28:46.070 align:start position:0%
so the parks
um

02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:49.010 --> 02:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
Parks fund
 
02:28:51.349 --> 02:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
allocated money to to maintain the
 
02:28:54.770 --> 02:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
bureau it's staffed the it's we're
 
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
working on some really exciting projects
 
02:28:59.870 --> 02:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
from the arpa fund to make improvements
 
02:29:02.809 --> 02:29:02.819 align:start position:0%
uh and it would be great that uh to go
 
02:29:06.469 --> 02:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
back to its original funding intent
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
discussion division members
 
02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire okay yeah so
 
02:29:15.770 --> 02:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
more specifically how are you spending
 
02:29:17.710 --> 02:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
this money
 
02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
so if I could clarify the Bureau of
 
02:29:22.250 --> 02:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
historic sites as the commissioner
 
02:29:24.410 --> 02:29:24.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned was has always been General
 
02:29:27.349 --> 02:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
funded for the reasons she stated uh
 
02:29:31.610 --> 02:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic crisis uh there was
 
02:29:33.950 --> 02:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
of course a lot of concern over how that
 
02:29:35.210 --> 02:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
might impact things so we were
 
02:29:36.650 --> 02:29:36.660 align:start position:0%
prescribed at that time to cut our
 
02:29:39.050 --> 02:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
general fund budget by 15 percent
 
02:29:40.969 --> 02:29:40.979 align:start position:0%
in doing so we had to take some pretty
 
02:29:42.650 --> 02:29:42.660 align:start position:0%
drastic measures one of those measures
 
02:29:44.990 --> 02:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
was pivoting to continue to fund the
 
02:29:46.910 --> 02:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
Bureau of historic sites using Park
 
02:29:49.910 --> 02:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
funds in order to sustain it to keep it
 
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
moving but certainly is not an ideal
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
situation so this is It's been
 
02:29:56.270 --> 02:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
maintained this way through the biennium
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
we'd like to get it back to the general
 
02:30:01.730 --> 02:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
fund Source uh sourcing that it had
 
02:30:04.010 --> 02:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
originally in order to continue to
 
02:30:06.530 --> 02:30:06.540 align:start position:0%
protect the priorities that are set for
 
02:30:08.630 --> 02:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of historic sites so the
 
02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
figure that is in hb2 is an estimate of
 
02:30:14.090 --> 02:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
what it would cost to continue to
 
02:30:16.190 --> 02:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
maintain the Bureau of historic sites
 
02:30:18.530 --> 02:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
moving forward but are these positions
 
02:30:20.990 --> 02:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
and so on in House Bill wins
 
02:30:23.929 --> 02:30:23.939 align:start position:0%
yes so all of the everything that would
 
02:30:26.389 --> 02:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
be covered is identified in house bill
 
02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
one the only difference is in house bill
 
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
one it's funded with Park funds however
 
02:30:32.929 --> 02:30:32.939 align:start position:0%
we were seeking to have that all right
 
02:30:35.570 --> 02:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
let's see it in house bill went okay
 
02:30:41.929 --> 02:30:41.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:41.939 --> 02:30:52.670 align:start position:0%
 
604

02:30:52.670 --> 02:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:52.680 --> 02:30:57.849 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:30:57.849 --> 02:30:57.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:01.130 --> 02:31:01.140 align:start position:0%
total and currently is in other funds
 
02:31:04.969 --> 02:31:04.979 align:start position:0%
budget so the idea is to Pivot that back
 
02:31:08.510 --> 02:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
to being funded with General funds
 
02:31:12.110 --> 02:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:15.290 --> 02:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
no this is um
 
02:31:20.809 --> 02:31:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's why does
 
02:31:27.950 --> 02:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
why does the benefits line jump so much
 
02:31:30.230 --> 02:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
is certain positions becoming permanent
 
02:31:33.170 --> 02:31:33.180 align:start position:0%
uh no typically what happens are in this
 
02:31:35.030 --> 02:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
case what happened was there was a
 
02:31:38.410 --> 02:31:38.420 align:start position:0%
change of personnel the prior individual
 
02:31:41.150 --> 02:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
who was in that position did not have
 
02:31:42.830 --> 02:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
benefit costs
 
02:31:44.870 --> 02:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
whereas the new individual that came in
 
02:31:47.570 --> 02:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
incurred a different amount of cost
 
02:31:49.849 --> 02:31:49.859 align:start position:0%
based on the plan that is for their
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
position so it has as you know the costs
 
02:31:56.110 --> 02:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
are pretty significant between
 
02:31:59.330 --> 02:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
plan differences so that's primarily
 
02:32:00.830 --> 02:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
what's driving that that substantial
 
02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:02.889 align:start position:0%
what's driving that that substantial
increase

02:32:02.889 --> 02:32:02.899 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:32:07.309 --> 02:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it's more than the salary
 
02:32:10.010 --> 02:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh well there's also the benefit line
 
02:32:12.290 --> 02:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
also supports the benefit costs for the
 
02:32:15.170 --> 02:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
temp labor which is the class 50 line
 
02:32:15.180 --> 02:32:16.849 align:start position:0%
temp labor which is the class 50 line
gotcha

02:32:16.849 --> 02:32:16.859 align:start position:0%
gotcha
 
02:32:16.859 --> 02:32:18.710 align:start position:0%
gotcha
so

02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's built in there as well
 
02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
additionally there is also the addition
 
02:32:26.889 --> 02:32:26.899 align:start position:0%
of a class 59 a full-time temp
 
02:32:30.170 --> 02:32:30.180 align:start position:0%
so that is also a factor uh in
 
02:32:31.550 --> 02:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
contributing to that increase in the
 
02:32:33.950 --> 02:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
benefit line as well all right thank you
 
02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
so I think those are further questions
 
02:32:41.630 --> 02:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
on Section 266 we okay with that
 
02:32:49.969 --> 02:32:49.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:51.889 --> 02:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
well we're letting them spend Parks
 
02:32:56.389 --> 02:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
money on Parks and not on this
 
02:32:58.550 --> 02:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
right so
 
02:33:00.770 --> 02:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
the parks will get suspend a little more
 
02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:11.450 --> 02:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:15.050 --> 02:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
but they're saying that it had been they
 
02:33:17.450 --> 02:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
were saying that it had been 900 000 up
 
02:33:20.030 --> 02:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
until last biennium when when it was
 
02:33:22.670 --> 02:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
funded with Parks money
 
02:33:24.889 --> 02:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
and now it's back to where it always has
 
02:33:28.670 --> 02:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
been so you know I would I would say
 
02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
considering the unbelievable amount of
 
02:33:33.170 --> 02:33:33.180 align:start position:0%
use our Parks have gotten during covet I
 
02:33:36.290 --> 02:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
think they really need the money too so
 
02:33:40.670 --> 02:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:23.389 --> 02:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:25.309 --> 02:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
the primary reason why there's an
 
02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
increase in in that number is related to
 
02:34:30.410 --> 02:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
the conversion of full-time temp
 
02:34:34.429 --> 02:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
positions uh that is what they call 90s
 
02:34:35.929 --> 02:34:35.939 align:start position:0%
so typically they're budgeted each
 
02:34:37.550 --> 02:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
biennium they're full-time but they're
 
02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
only Budget on a biennial basis within
 
02:34:42.710 --> 02:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
our Park system we have a substantial
 
02:34:44.330 --> 02:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
number of those positions we carried
 
02:34:46.670 --> 02:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
them that way for for many years many
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
bienniums uh it was decided in this
 
02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
biennium to strategically to to go ahead
 
02:34:56.690 --> 02:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
and convert some that we have kept for
 
02:34:58.670 --> 02:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
quite a long time in that capacity it
 
02:35:00.590 --> 02:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
has been determined obviously these
 
02:35:03.950 --> 02:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
positions are needed uh they are filled
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
every biennium going back
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
potentially some of them up to 20 years
 
02:35:10.250 --> 02:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
so we thought it would be appropriate to
 
02:35:12.590 --> 02:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead and convert them to permanent
 
02:35:14.030 --> 02:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
classified positions so it would
 
02:35:16.849 --> 02:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
essentially just be a wash removing them
 
02:35:18.950 --> 02:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
from the full-time Temp and instead
 
02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
making them permanent classified
 
02:35:22.670 --> 02:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
positions of course the permanent
 
02:35:24.230 --> 02:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
classified position count appears on the
 
02:35:27.110 --> 02:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
budget the full-time temp count does not
 
02:35:29.330 --> 02:35:29.340 align:start position:0%
so you would you don't see that that net
 
02:35:29.340 --> 02:35:34.610 align:start position:0%
so you would you don't see that that net
effect

02:35:34.610 --> 02:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:38.150 --> 02:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
yeah um well with one exception uh we do
 
02:35:40.969 --> 02:35:40.979 align:start position:0%
have we did put a request in for uh
 
02:35:42.889 --> 02:35:42.899 align:start position:0%
three new positions and at the same time
 
02:35:45.650 --> 02:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
abolished positions as well to keep the
 
02:35:48.469 --> 02:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
count correct essentially deciding there
 
02:35:49.550 --> 02:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
are certain needs that our department
 
02:35:51.770 --> 02:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
has certain classifications that are
 
02:35:55.070 --> 02:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
necessary uh where others are not so we
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
were able to to to change that to uh to
 
02:36:02.809 --> 02:36:02.819 align:start position:0%
net that out however we did request a
 
02:36:06.889 --> 02:36:06.899 align:start position:0%
a full-time uh park ranger I'm sorry for
 
02:36:10.429 --> 02:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
a stranger my apologies and also uh we
 
02:36:12.050 --> 02:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
were approved for a position in our
 
02:36:14.090 --> 02:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs for the arts division
 
02:36:17.090 --> 02:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
so there are actually technically an
 
02:36:19.969 --> 02:36:19.979 align:start position:0%
increase of two positions uh for the
 
02:36:22.670 --> 02:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:25.130 --> 02:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
okay any questions on further on the
 
02:36:25.140 --> 02:36:27.469 align:start position:0%
okay any questions on further on the
budget

02:36:27.469 --> 02:36:27.479 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:36:29.750 --> 02:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire yeah so I asked
 
02:36:32.090 --> 02:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
the LBA to make an amendment to House
 
02:36:34.490 --> 02:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
Bill one
 
02:36:36.650 --> 02:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
um which I guess he's Mike is reaching
 
02:36:53.690 --> 02:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:02.150 --> 02:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:04.389 --> 02:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
02:37:06.650 --> 02:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire liked to speak to
 
02:37:09.110 --> 02:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
his Amendment yes so
 
02:37:11.330 --> 02:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
um this is uh five hundred thousand
 
02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
dollars a year for New Hampshire public
 
02:37:17.090 --> 02:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
television and as I understand it that
 
02:37:21.349 --> 02:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
was removed from the budget 12 years ago
 
02:37:25.429 --> 02:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
um and now it's coming back but in my
 
02:37:25.439 --> 02:37:26.990 align:start position:0%
um and now it's coming back but in my
mind

02:37:26.990 --> 02:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
mind
 
02:37:30.530 --> 02:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
you know the public doesn't need
 
02:37:30.540 --> 02:37:31.750 align:start position:0%
you know the public doesn't need
um

02:37:31.750 --> 02:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
we don't need to take funds from the
 
02:37:35.929 --> 02:37:35.939 align:start position:0%
public to create television I mean if
 
02:37:38.450 --> 02:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
there's anything we have plenty of it's
 
02:37:41.210 --> 02:37:41.220 align:start position:0%
videos and television so
 
02:37:41.220 --> 02:37:42.290 align:start position:0%
videos and television so
um

02:37:42.290 --> 02:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:44.690 --> 02:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
I just think this is an inappropriate
 
02:37:44.700 --> 02:37:47.090 align:start position:0%
I just think this is an inappropriate
expenditure

02:37:47.090 --> 02:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
02:37:49.070 --> 02:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
okay I'll we'll take this under
 
02:37:52.910 --> 02:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
advisement only because it's after 12
 
02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
and we are lacking a number of our
 
02:37:57.410 --> 02:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
members representative Sweeney and
 
02:37:59.389 --> 02:37:59.399 align:start position:0%
Hewitt are not here so before we took a
 
02:38:02.270 --> 02:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
vote on it I'd like to because it's a
 
02:38:04.670 --> 02:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
significant change I guess if you will
 
02:38:07.790 --> 02:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
or ask rather so we can take this up
 
02:38:11.090 --> 02:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
from perhaps on Monday but thanks for
 
02:38:13.849 --> 02:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
providing Us in advance
 
02:38:15.830 --> 02:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
all right uh is there are there any
 
02:38:18.530 --> 02:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
other questions for the commissioner or
 
02:38:23.030 --> 02:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:25.370 --> 02:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
are we okay with it
 
02:38:28.130 --> 02:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
budget is presented with the obviously
 
02:38:29.809 --> 02:38:29.819 align:start position:0%
recognizing we do have an amendment
 
02:38:32.150 --> 02:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
which could adjust your budget the 500
 
02:38:36.070 --> 02:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
000 a year for the public television
 
02:38:38.510 --> 02:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
seeing no I guess we're okay with the
 
02:38:38.520 --> 02:38:40.070 align:start position:0%
seeing no I guess we're okay with the
budget

02:38:40.070 --> 02:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:38:43.429 --> 02:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
okay Mr Hoffman is there something else
 
02:38:47.270 --> 02:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
would that include the uh 150 000 for
 
02:38:50.510 --> 02:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
Utilities in the doit position thanks
 
02:38:53.450 --> 02:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
for reminding us of that yes it would I
 
02:38:54.889 --> 02:38:54.899 align:start position:0%
think we kind of but thanks for
 
02:38:56.570 --> 02:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
reminding us
 
02:38:59.389 --> 02:38:59.399 align:start position:0%
so um May I just ask um for process
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
purposes so you'll say you'll take up
 
02:39:03.770 --> 02:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
the amendment on Monday
 
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
would you like somebody from our agency
 
02:39:08.450 --> 02:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
there to answer questions yeah we have
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh General discussion of the budget
 
02:39:13.490 --> 02:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
starting Monday again trying to get to
 
02:39:16.730 --> 02:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
the final stage okay and uh what I'll do
 
02:39:18.889 --> 02:39:18.899 align:start position:0%
is I'll just schedule it for 9 30. so
 
02:39:21.530 --> 02:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
you have a specific time wonderful uh
 
02:39:24.770 --> 02:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
just before the vote on the retirement
 
02:39:27.170 --> 02:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
well we have two retirement bills at 9
 
02:39:29.389 --> 02:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
30. I just scheduled it for 9 30 on
 
02:39:31.309 --> 02:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
Monday morning all right
 
02:39:31.319 --> 02:39:32.210 align:start position:0%
Monday morning all right
um

02:39:32.210 --> 02:39:32.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:34.969 --> 02:39:34.979 align:start position:0%
are they both scheduled for 9 30. you
 
02:39:37.309 --> 02:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
know yes okay
 
02:39:40.370 --> 02:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
those may take some significant time so
 
02:39:40.380 --> 02:39:41.450 align:start position:0%
those may take some significant time so
we'll

02:39:41.450 --> 02:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
02:39:44.330 --> 02:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
we'll get you in at 9 30 along with
 
02:39:46.849 --> 02:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
those perfect so we'll get we'll take
 
02:39:48.170 --> 02:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
care of that first and then we'll move
 
02:39:50.389 --> 02:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
to our other business thank you okay
 
02:39:53.690 --> 02:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:56.210 --> 02:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
all right we're adjourned until one
 
02:40:01.370 --> 02:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
o'clock we have um oplc review at one we
 
02:40:04.330 --> 02:40:04.340 align:start position:0%
have the chair of the
 
02:40:06.770 --> 02:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
Edna committee representative Carol
 
02:40:08.990 --> 02:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
McGuire and several other reps I guess
 
02:40:11.510 --> 02:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
that are coming to to speak to us about
 
03:27:29.570 --> 03:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:32.090 --> 03:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
so because we have so many folks here
 
03:27:55.130 --> 03:27:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:55.140 --> 03:28:11.090 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:28:11.090 --> 03:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:16.560 --> 03:33:14.990 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:33:14.990 --> 03:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:15.000 --> 03:33:21.309 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:33:21.309 --> 03:33:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:26.330 --> 03:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
the discussion on oplc uh several weeks
 
03:33:28.130 --> 03:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
ago I asked the
 
03:33:30.290 --> 03:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
Edna committee that's chaired by
 
03:33:33.170 --> 03:33:33.180 align:start position:0%
representative Carol Maguire
 
03:33:35.870 --> 03:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
if she could take a look at these
 
03:33:39.590 --> 03:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
sections that were proposed to change or
 
03:33:42.469 --> 03:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
run their own schedule out or whatever
 
03:33:44.809 --> 03:33:44.819 align:start position:0%
the case may be
 
03:33:48.130 --> 03:33:48.140 align:start position:0%
I think they're like 257
 
03:33:51.410 --> 03:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
sections or 54 sections but anyway
 
03:33:54.530 --> 03:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
um representative McGuire you're welcome
 
03:33:56.570 --> 03:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
to tell us what you found or what you're
 
03:34:00.290 --> 03:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
suggesting all right thank you the this
 
03:34:02.030 --> 03:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
is five amendments for your
 
03:34:02.040 --> 03:34:03.710 align:start position:0%
is five amendments for your
consideration

03:34:03.710 --> 03:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
03:34:07.010 --> 03:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
the first one I
 
03:34:10.190 --> 03:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
I in the entire committee hopes that you
 
03:34:12.050 --> 03:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
will adopt because
 
03:34:12.060 --> 03:34:14.030 align:start position:0%
will adopt because
it's

03:34:14.030 --> 03:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:34:17.290 --> 03:34:17.300 align:start position:0%
essentially it's the house position
 
03:34:21.590 --> 03:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
it starts by deleting sections 285 and
 
03:34:26.450 --> 03:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
286 which are Pages 90 to 102 and that's
 
03:34:28.030 --> 03:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
the whole real
 
03:34:31.370 --> 03:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
statutory recodification of the oplc
 
03:34:31.380 --> 03:34:33.170 align:start position:0%
statutory recodification of the oplc
organization

03:34:33.170 --> 03:34:33.180 align:start position:0%
organization
 
03:34:37.190 --> 03:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
the reason to delete it is that we
 
03:34:41.030 --> 03:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
included that in House Bill 655 which
 
03:34:44.389 --> 03:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
we all passed yesterday on consent
 
03:34:48.290 --> 03:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
and it has somewhat expanded language in
 
03:34:51.410 --> 03:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
some areas where the DNA committee
 
03:34:53.929 --> 03:34:53.939 align:start position:0%
thought it needed it a disciplinary
 
03:34:56.349 --> 03:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
investigations and so forth
 
03:34:59.330 --> 03:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
so it is
 
03:35:02.090 --> 03:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
in hopes of that you and you and I would
 
03:35:04.070 --> 03:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
not have to try and keep these two
 
03:35:07.190 --> 03:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
sections in sync that we want you to
 
03:35:09.469 --> 03:35:09.479 align:start position:0%
take it out of house bill to
 
03:35:09.479 --> 03:35:12.050 align:start position:0%
take it out of house bill to
um

03:35:12.050 --> 03:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:15.410 --> 03:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
you can continue okay fine thanks uh on
 
03:35:17.330 --> 03:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
page 110
 
03:35:19.670 --> 03:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh section
 
03:35:22.729 --> 03:35:22.739 align:start position:0%
310 replaced secretary of state with the
 
03:35:25.550 --> 03:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
executive director incorrectly
 
03:35:29.210 --> 03:35:29.220 align:start position:0%
I did not we want to replace the
 
03:35:30.889 --> 03:35:30.899 align:start position:0%
secretary of state with the executive
 
03:35:33.950 --> 03:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
director and in section 311 we do not
 
03:35:36.650 --> 03:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
want to replace the secretary of state
 
03:35:38.870 --> 03:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
with executive director it looks like
 
03:35:38.880 --> 03:35:40.490 align:start position:0%
with executive director it looks like
the

03:35:40.490 --> 03:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:35:43.190 --> 03:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
um that fell through the cracks this is
 
03:35:44.870 --> 03:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
relative to the transfer of the
 
03:35:46.610 --> 03:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
auctioneers board
 
03:35:50.929 --> 03:35:50.939 align:start position:0%
and section 310 is the responsibilities
 
03:35:53.690 --> 03:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
of the Secretary of State toward the
 
03:35:55.849 --> 03:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
board which are now being transferred to
 
03:36:00.110 --> 03:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
oplc and section 311 is the business
 
03:36:03.290 --> 03:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
title restrictions and that is still the
 
03:36:05.870 --> 03:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's responsibility I
 
03:36:08.090 --> 03:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
believe he pointed that out to uh to
 
03:36:11.389 --> 03:36:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:15.710 --> 03:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:19.610 --> 03:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
section 315 I forget which board that is
 
03:36:23.809 --> 03:36:23.819 align:start position:0%
it's a minor edit the the section lists
 
03:36:26.030 --> 03:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
the members of the board but that
 
03:36:27.790 --> 03:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't change
 
03:36:30.530 --> 03:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
the original number of members from
 
03:36:32.809 --> 03:36:32.819 align:start position:0%
seven to five even though the five
 
03:36:34.910 --> 03:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
members are specifically listed further
 
03:36:39.290 --> 03:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
on in the paragraph that's a an easy one
 
03:36:39.300 --> 03:36:40.969 align:start position:0%
on in the paragraph that's a an easy one
on

03:36:40.969 --> 03:36:40.979 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:36:46.250 --> 03:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
sections 421 and 427 which is the
 
03:36:46.260 --> 03:36:48.550 align:start position:0%
sections 421 and 427 which is the
massage

03:36:48.550 --> 03:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
massage
 
03:36:50.870 --> 03:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
therapy section
 
03:36:53.750 --> 03:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
the board is combined with the boards of
 
03:36:58.190 --> 03:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
Asian Bodywork Reiki and um
 
03:37:00.469 --> 03:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
I forget what else
 
03:37:00.479 --> 03:37:01.550 align:start position:0%
I forget what else
um

03:37:01.550 --> 03:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:06.769 --> 03:37:06.779 align:start position:0%
which is mine but it also incorporates a
 
03:37:08.990 --> 03:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
establishment license that the house
 
03:37:12.170 --> 03:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
killed when we killed house bill 341. so
 
03:37:15.050 --> 03:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
the edits on those sections merely
 
03:37:18.590 --> 03:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
remove the reference to establishments
 
03:37:21.769 --> 03:37:21.779 align:start position:0%
so that's the house position
 
03:37:21.779 --> 03:37:23.929 align:start position:0%
so that's the house position
um

03:37:23.929 --> 03:37:23.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:28.670 --> 03:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
on Section 484 it calls for two Hospital
 
03:37:31.990 --> 03:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacists on the pharmacy board
 
03:37:34.910 --> 03:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
upon consideration that's a typo it
 
03:37:40.010 --> 03:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:43.070 --> 03:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
the other two points are that first of
 
03:37:43.080 --> 03:37:44.870 align:start position:0%
the other two points are that first of
all

03:37:44.870 --> 03:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:37:47.469 --> 03:37:47.479 align:start position:0%
if we're going to repeal any licenses
 
03:37:49.969 --> 03:37:49.979 align:start position:0%
Edna strongly believes the fees should
 
03:37:53.030 --> 03:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
be re refunded
 
03:37:56.330 --> 03:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
and the oplc agrees and they ask that it
 
03:37:59.330 --> 03:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
be simply refunded and not prorated
 
03:38:01.190 --> 03:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
because it's simpler for them to just
 
03:38:02.929 --> 03:38:02.939 align:start position:0%
send out the checks that way
 
03:38:05.330 --> 03:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any problem with that
 
03:38:07.190 --> 03:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:38:11.510 --> 03:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
we want to change the effective date
 
03:38:11.520 --> 03:38:13.010 align:start position:0%
we want to change the effective date
from

03:38:13.010 --> 03:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:38:15.590 --> 03:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
July 1st to September
 
03:38:18.650 --> 03:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
because with Theory structuring these
 
03:38:20.269 --> 03:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
boards you're going to have to have the
 
03:38:21.889 --> 03:38:21.899 align:start position:0%
governor and Council approving a whole
 
03:38:26.450 --> 03:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
lot of new appointees and
 
03:38:28.429 --> 03:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
we think a little more time is
 
03:38:28.439 --> 03:38:30.710 align:start position:0%
we think a little more time is
appropriate

03:38:30.710 --> 03:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:38:35.330 --> 03:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
and that's that's that amendment of 2023
 
03:38:35.340 --> 03:38:37.729 align:start position:0%
and that's that's that amendment of 2023
1007.

03:38:37.729 --> 03:38:37.739 align:start position:0%
1007.
 
03:38:40.309 --> 03:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:38:43.370 --> 03:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
representative evil so just so unclear
 
03:38:47.090 --> 03:38:47.100 align:start position:0%
this is a committee Amendment
 
03:38:50.030 --> 03:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
I got my name on it it all of the points
 
03:38:52.429 --> 03:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned were specifically
 
03:38:54.530 --> 03:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
discussed with the committee and it is
 
03:38:56.269 --> 03:38:56.279 align:start position:0%
the committee consensus that they need
 
03:38:58.790 --> 03:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
to be included in house build need to be
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:06.479 --> 03:39:07.690 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:39:07.690 --> 03:39:07.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:39:10.969 --> 03:39:10.979 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions on at
 
03:39:17.269 --> 03:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:20.210 --> 03:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
from the division
 
03:39:20.220 --> 03:39:23.090 align:start position:0%
from the division
any

03:39:23.090 --> 03:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:26.150 --> 03:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
there is a hand up of
 
03:39:28.070 --> 03:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
recognize the gentleman or gentle woman
 
03:39:30.889 --> 03:39:30.899 align:start position:0%
I can't tell in the back
 
03:39:32.929 --> 03:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
oh oh okay
 
03:39:35.450 --> 03:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks
 
03:39:35.460 --> 03:39:37.309 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks
yeah

03:39:37.309 --> 03:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:39:41.210 --> 03:39:41.220 align:start position:0%
so seeing no questions on that the
 
03:39:43.610 --> 03:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
division won't make a decision on any of
 
03:39:46.309 --> 03:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
this until Monday give it an opportunity
 
03:39:48.050 --> 03:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
of the members to take a look at it over
 
03:39:49.550 --> 03:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
the weekend
 
03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
all right that's fine the Second
 
03:39:56.450 --> 03:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
Amendment the lead sections 443 444 and
 
03:40:00.590 --> 03:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
445 which are the consolidation of the
 
03:40:06.170 --> 03:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:08.150 --> 03:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
licensed Alcohol and Other Drug
 
03:40:10.910 --> 03:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
counselors into the board of mental
 
03:40:12.290 --> 03:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
health practice
 
03:40:15.170 --> 03:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
that is a section that we took out of
 
03:40:18.790 --> 03:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 655 because we had
 
03:40:21.950 --> 03:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
some concerns about it those concerns
 
03:40:26.750 --> 03:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
remain we don't think the consolidation
 
03:40:26.760 --> 03:40:28.610 align:start position:0%
remain we don't think the consolidation
uh

03:40:28.610 --> 03:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:40:30.950 --> 03:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
has been fully vetted and we'd like to
 
03:40:33.229 --> 03:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
pull it out of house bill too and let
 
03:40:35.210 --> 03:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
Edna work on it
 
03:40:35.220 --> 03:40:36.170 align:start position:0%
Edna work on it
um

03:40:36.170 --> 03:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:38.510 --> 03:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
there's no money involved so it
 
03:40:46.070 --> 03:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:48.349 --> 03:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative camberells thank you
 
03:40:50.450 --> 03:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh and thank you representative
 
03:40:52.429 --> 03:40:52.439 align:start position:0%
McGuire taking the question
 
03:40:56.110 --> 03:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
um I see that it says delete sections
 
03:41:02.750 --> 03:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
443 to 445 yes 443 is the deletes the
 
03:41:05.210 --> 03:41:05.220 align:start position:0%
board of licensed alcohol and drug
 
03:41:09.229 --> 03:41:09.239 align:start position:0%
counselors 444 deletes the board of
 
03:41:12.830 --> 03:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
psychology in 445 rewrites the board of
 
03:41:14.750 --> 03:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
mental health practice to include these
 
03:41:14.760 --> 03:41:16.090 align:start position:0%
mental health practice to include these
other

03:41:16.090 --> 03:41:16.100 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:41:20.570 --> 03:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
but it says Pages 160 through 181. it's
 
03:41:20.580 --> 03:41:22.670 align:start position:0%
but it says Pages 160 through 181. it's
a

03:41:22.670 --> 03:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:41:27.530 --> 03:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
fact but the uh um 443 444 and 445 are
 
03:41:32.090 --> 03:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
all on page 160. they start 440 section
 
03:41:35.809 --> 03:41:35.819 align:start position:0%
445 finishes on page 181 got you thank
 
03:41:39.190 --> 03:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:42.110 --> 03:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
and I will say that we have a regulatory
 
03:41:44.389 --> 03:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
bill that we have retained with the
 
03:41:47.330 --> 03:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
expectation that we would cons we would
 
03:41:48.889 --> 03:41:48.899 align:start position:0%
include any
 
03:41:57.830 --> 03:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:59.870 --> 03:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
the division on this
 
03:42:01.849 --> 03:42:01.859 align:start position:0%
seeing none but I guess you could move
 
03:42:04.550 --> 03:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
along to amendment number three well
 
03:42:06.530 --> 03:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
three and four ought to be considered
 
03:42:06.540 --> 03:42:08.450 align:start position:0%
three and four ought to be considered
together

03:42:08.450 --> 03:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:42:08.460 --> 03:42:09.290 align:start position:0%
together
um

03:42:09.290 --> 03:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:11.990 --> 03:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
the nursing assist the licensed nursing
 
03:42:15.290 --> 03:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
assistant LNA is proposed in House Bill
 
03:42:16.849 --> 03:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
2 to
 
03:42:16.859 --> 03:42:18.590 align:start position:0%
2 to
uh

03:42:18.590 --> 03:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:42:21.650 --> 03:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
not require a license just the federal
 
03:42:21.660 --> 03:42:25.610 align:start position:0%
not require a license just the federal
certification

03:42:25.610 --> 03:42:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:28.550 --> 03:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
this caused a lot of consternation and
 
03:42:31.309 --> 03:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
Edna and various people that talk to us
 
03:42:33.889 --> 03:42:33.899 align:start position:0%
because the scope of practice for a
 
03:42:35.510 --> 03:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistant is
 
03:42:39.290 --> 03:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
significantly broader than the scope of
 
03:42:41.690 --> 03:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
practice for the certified federally
 
03:42:43.790 --> 03:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
certified nursing assistant
 
03:42:47.750 --> 03:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's also questions of supervision a
 
03:42:50.630 --> 03:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
LNA is responsible for their own
 
03:42:52.729 --> 03:42:52.739 align:start position:0%
continuing education
 
03:42:56.229 --> 03:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
and you know making sure they get it
 
03:42:58.969 --> 03:42:58.979 align:start position:0%
whereas a nursing assistant has no
 
03:43:02.809 --> 03:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
requirements and any uh continuing
 
03:43:05.269 --> 03:43:05.279 align:start position:0%
education is the responsibility of the
 
03:43:05.279 --> 03:43:07.670 align:start position:0%
education is the responsibility of the
employer

03:43:07.670 --> 03:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
employer
 
03:43:11.090 --> 03:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
also the nursing assistant is working
 
03:43:13.550 --> 03:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
under the supervision and under the
 
03:43:16.010 --> 03:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
license of a registered nurse or a
 
03:43:19.070 --> 03:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
licensed practical nurse whatever level
 
03:43:20.990 --> 03:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
of licensed
 
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
health care worker and those professions
 
03:43:26.870 --> 03:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
have said that they don't want to buy
 
03:43:29.990 --> 03:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to have that responsibility
 
03:43:30.000 --> 03:43:31.490 align:start position:0%
don't want to have that responsibility
so

03:43:31.490 --> 03:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:43:34.729 --> 03:43:34.739 align:start position:0%
again this may be the right thing to do
 
03:43:37.849 --> 03:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
but we're Edna was
 
03:43:40.010 --> 03:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly convinced that it hadn't
 
03:43:42.229 --> 03:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
been thought through so we'd like to
 
03:43:44.349 --> 03:43:44.359 align:start position:0%
pull that
 
03:43:47.570 --> 03:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
Amendment four just takes all the
 
03:43:50.870 --> 03:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
changes of the nursing board out of stat
 
03:43:52.729 --> 03:43:52.739 align:start position:0%
out of house bill to
 
03:43:55.849 --> 03:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
Amendment Three
 
03:43:55.859 --> 03:43:58.550 align:start position:0%
Amendment Three
um

03:43:58.550 --> 03:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:03.130 --> 03:44:03.140 align:start position:0%
changes some of the board sections to
 
03:44:06.889 --> 03:44:06.899 align:start position:0%
decrease the number of board members as
 
03:44:08.809 --> 03:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
the governor wished
 
03:44:08.819 --> 03:44:10.929 align:start position:0%
the governor wished
and

03:44:10.929 --> 03:44:10.939 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:44:15.469 --> 03:44:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:17.750 --> 03:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
to keep the language of a nursing
 
03:44:20.210 --> 03:44:20.220 align:start position:0%
assistant in statute
 
03:44:20.220 --> 03:44:21.229 align:start position:0%
assistant in statute
um

03:44:21.229 --> 03:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:23.210 --> 03:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
that was my first approach on how to
 
03:44:26.210 --> 03:44:26.220 align:start position:0%
deal with this but when I went back I
 
03:44:27.769 --> 03:44:27.779 align:start position:0%
thought that it might make more sense
 
03:44:31.010 --> 03:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
just to delete those two those few
 
03:44:31.020 --> 03:44:32.389 align:start position:0%
just to delete those two those few
sections

03:44:32.389 --> 03:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
sections
 
03:44:34.490 --> 03:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
the Board of Nursing is one of our
 
03:44:36.110 --> 03:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
largest boards
 
03:44:38.570 --> 03:44:38.580 align:start position:0%
they have there's something like 30 000
 
03:44:38.580 --> 03:44:40.130 align:start position:0%
they have there's something like 30 000
nurses

03:44:40.130 --> 03:44:40.140 align:start position:0%
nurses
 
03:44:43.190 --> 03:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
so we're more
 
03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh it makes more sense to have a larger
 
03:44:53.870 --> 03:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:56.690 --> 03:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
so it's those are for your consideration
 
03:44:59.750 --> 03:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
you can do it either way you think we
 
03:45:01.429 --> 03:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
just don't think we ought to re just
 
03:45:07.630 --> 03:45:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:10.670 --> 03:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
representative Deanne McGuire and thank
 
03:45:12.590 --> 03:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you representative
 
03:45:12.600 --> 03:45:14.630 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you representative
McGuire

03:45:14.630 --> 03:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
McGuire
 
03:45:17.570 --> 03:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
um so are you saying that Amendment
 
03:45:20.269 --> 03:45:20.279 align:start position:0%
Three is additions
 
03:45:22.190 --> 03:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
in some sense because you said Amendment
 
03:45:24.710 --> 03:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
four you you took away all changes to
 
03:45:28.670 --> 03:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
nursing yes but three has specific
 
03:45:30.830 --> 03:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
adding back certain changes to nursing
 
03:45:34.070 --> 03:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
is that the idea section three makes
 
03:45:36.349 --> 03:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
changes to the
 
03:45:38.690 --> 03:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
part of House Bill 2 that deals with the
 
03:45:41.510 --> 03:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing and the licensees of
 
03:45:43.309 --> 03:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
the Board of Nursing
 
03:45:43.319 --> 03:45:44.570 align:start position:0%
the Board of Nursing
uh

03:45:44.570 --> 03:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:45:46.790 --> 03:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
the two are you can either pick one or
 
03:45:47.990 --> 03:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
the other they're two different
 
03:45:51.229 --> 03:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
approaches to how to handle it I'm
 
03:45:54.349 --> 03:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
willing to let you guys figure it out
 
03:45:56.929 --> 03:45:56.939 align:start position:0%
so you're saying we can't pass three and
 
03:45:59.750 --> 03:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
four it's just three or just four is
 
03:46:01.550 --> 03:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
that correct they are they are
 
03:46:03.830 --> 03:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
alternatives not compliments thank you
 
03:46:04.910 --> 03:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
very much
 
03:46:08.090 --> 03:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
representative evil yeah I
 
03:46:10.490 --> 03:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
I've clarified this but one suggests
 
03:46:14.990 --> 03:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
changes if we decide to leave 460
 
03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
6 and 67 in but the other option is just
 
03:46:22.010 --> 03:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
to get rid of 46 through 42 and let you
 
03:46:24.650 --> 03:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
guys work on it some more
 
03:46:28.969 --> 03:46:28.979 align:start position:0%
yes representative Dan McGuire does does
 
03:46:32.870 --> 03:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment Three de-license lnas
 
03:46:46.250 --> 03:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:46.260 --> 03:46:48.349 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:46:48.349 --> 03:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
it talks about instead of creating a new
 
03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
title nursing Aid it talks about a
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
nursing assistant it doesn't specify the
 
03:46:57.960 --> 03:46:59.150 align:start position:0%
nursing assistant it doesn't specify the
license

03:46:59.150 --> 03:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:47:01.070 --> 03:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
but it um
 
03:47:03.229 --> 03:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
it leaves the definition of a nursing
 
03:47:07.429 --> 03:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:08.990 --> 03:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
your other question representative
 
03:47:09.000 --> 03:47:10.250 align:start position:0%
your other question representative
Damocles

03:47:10.250 --> 03:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
Damocles
 
03:47:10.260 --> 03:47:12.229 align:start position:0%
Damocles
yeah

03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:47:14.450 --> 03:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
thinking on it I would recommend you
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
take the second choice because that's a
 
03:47:18.290 --> 03:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
little cleaner but
 
03:47:20.929 --> 03:47:20.939 align:start position:0%
I would be so inclined
 
03:47:24.170 --> 03:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
well yeah the the first was how I first
 
03:47:26.530 --> 03:47:26.540 align:start position:0%
looked at it and then after
 
03:47:29.150 --> 03:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
discussing it and with some other people
 
03:47:30.769 --> 03:47:30.779 align:start position:0%
and thinking about it I think it'd be
 
03:47:32.630 --> 03:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
simpler just to not change the board of
 
03:47:38.269 --> 03:47:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:40.429 --> 03:47:40.439 align:start position:0%
is there any more discussion on uh
 
03:47:43.790 --> 03:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment Three or Amendment four from
 
03:47:47.330 --> 03:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:49.910 --> 03:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
I don't see any
 
03:47:54.190 --> 03:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
okay so a question for the chair of Edna
 
03:47:58.610 --> 03:47:58.620 align:start position:0%
the suggestion of amendment three and o4
 
03:48:00.769 --> 03:48:00.779 align:start position:0%
was that from the committee did there
 
03:48:02.950 --> 03:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
was there no no
 
03:48:04.910 --> 03:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the committee was
 
03:48:07.790 --> 03:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
that we needed to look at the
 
03:48:07.800 --> 03:48:08.690 align:start position:0%
that we needed to look at the
um

03:48:08.690 --> 03:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:11.210 --> 03:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
the LNA license we didn't think just
 
03:48:12.950 --> 03:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
deleting it was
 
03:48:15.590 --> 03:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh the right way to go at this point in
 
03:48:19.130 --> 03:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
time and it was actually talking
 
03:48:22.010 --> 03:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
reading a few of the many emails I got
 
03:48:25.550 --> 03:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
on the subject talking to the nursing
 
03:48:27.910 --> 03:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
home administrator from Merrimack County
 
03:48:30.889 --> 03:48:30.899 align:start position:0%
and talking to your staff
 
03:48:33.830 --> 03:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
I decided it would be simpler just to do
 
03:48:37.190 --> 03:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
do Amendment for but I wanted to offer
 
03:48:38.330 --> 03:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
you the choice
 
03:48:39.769 --> 03:48:39.779 align:start position:0%
oh thanks
 
03:48:39.779 --> 03:48:41.389 align:start position:0%
oh thanks
representable

03:48:41.389 --> 03:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
representable
 
03:48:43.870 --> 03:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
so as we decide whether we're going to
 
03:48:47.210 --> 03:48:47.220 align:start position:0%
delete these sections from hb2 what
 
03:48:49.910 --> 03:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
would be next in the process you would
 
03:48:52.370 --> 03:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
just take on the the review of these
 
03:48:54.410 --> 03:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
things and then ultimately introduce
 
03:48:57.050 --> 03:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
another bill or just as I said in your
 
03:49:00.410 --> 03:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
mind we have a retained bill on
 
03:49:00.420 --> 03:49:01.729 align:start position:0%
mind we have a retained bill on
regulation

03:49:01.729 --> 03:49:01.739 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
03:49:06.170 --> 03:49:06.180 align:start position:0%
Professional Regulation that we can use
 
03:49:10.190 --> 03:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
to amend it to include the
 
03:49:12.670 --> 03:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
the board of board of Mental Health
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
recodification because that was
 
03:49:19.190 --> 03:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
we were expecting to use it for
 
03:49:19.200 --> 03:49:20.349 align:start position:0%
we were expecting to use it for
um

03:49:20.349 --> 03:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
any changes to the board of Mental
 
03:49:22.920 --> 03:49:23.809 align:start position:0%
any changes to the board of Mental
Health

03:49:23.809 --> 03:49:23.819 align:start position:0%
Health
 
03:49:27.469 --> 03:49:27.479 align:start position:0%
because we they were several issues that
 
03:49:29.330 --> 03:49:29.340 align:start position:0%
we hadn't resolved that we took out of
 
03:49:29.340 --> 03:49:31.130 align:start position:0%
we hadn't resolved that we took out of
655

03:49:31.130 --> 03:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
655
 
03:49:34.130 --> 03:49:34.140 align:start position:0%
and so we that's the plan we could also
 
03:49:36.830 --> 03:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
deal with the nurses in the same bill or
 
03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
submit another bill for next year
 
03:49:43.750 --> 03:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:46.910 --> 03:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
now you say whatever makes sense what
 
03:49:49.790 --> 03:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:49.800 --> 03:49:50.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:49:50.630 --> 03:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
the board of mental health we have to
 
03:49:55.070 --> 03:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
talk about because we there are a number
 
03:49:58.429 --> 03:49:58.439 align:start position:0%
of issues that uh
 
03:50:01.010 --> 03:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
that need to be be considered before we
 
03:50:03.710 --> 03:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
make any make those changes
 
03:50:07.010 --> 03:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
um the lnas I'm
 
03:50:08.990 --> 03:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
I'm leaning toward just saying don't
 
03:50:10.790 --> 03:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
leave them alone don't bother them but
 
03:50:10.800 --> 03:50:11.570 align:start position:0%
leave them alone don't bother them but
that's

03:50:11.570 --> 03:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:50:15.190 --> 03:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:17.750 --> 03:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
all right representative Dion McGuire
 
03:50:20.330 --> 03:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just going to say so board so
 
03:50:22.969 --> 03:50:22.979 align:start position:0%
amendment number two throws the board of
 
03:50:25.010 --> 03:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
mental health back at the Edna committee
 
03:50:26.929 --> 03:50:26.939 align:start position:0%
for their decision right and amendment
 
03:50:29.030 --> 03:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
number four essentially does the same
 
03:50:32.450 --> 03:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
thing for the nursing area right and
 
03:50:34.250 --> 03:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
amendment number one deals with things
 
03:50:40.130 --> 03:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:41.929 --> 03:50:41.939 align:start position:0%
all right should we go to number five
 
03:50:44.150 --> 03:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
yes uh moving on to number
 
03:50:47.570 --> 03:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:50.389 --> 03:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
are there any uh licenses that you
 
03:50:54.530 --> 03:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:59.090 --> 03:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:59.100 --> 03:51:03.550 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:51:03.550 --> 03:51:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:06.469 --> 03:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
these amendments are essentially the
 
03:51:09.290 --> 03:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
consensus of the Edna committee we we
 
03:51:11.870 --> 03:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
looked at this this section of House
 
03:51:15.590 --> 03:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 and did triage and we took what
 
03:51:17.570 --> 03:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
we consider were the important issues
 
03:51:19.190 --> 03:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
that we wanted
 
03:51:21.290 --> 03:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh you'd either
 
03:51:24.590 --> 03:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
do or not do as the case may be
 
03:51:24.600 --> 03:51:25.250 align:start position:0%
do or not do as the case may be
um

03:51:25.250 --> 03:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:28.190 --> 03:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
there were moving on to amendment number
 
03:51:31.429 --> 03:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
five there were the Foresters Landscape
 
03:51:34.130 --> 03:51:34.140 align:start position:0%
Architects and natural scientists
 
03:51:36.710 --> 03:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
and we were convinced those licenses
 
03:51:40.070 --> 03:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
should not be repealed at this time
 
03:51:40.080 --> 03:51:42.010 align:start position:0%
should not be repealed at this time
because

03:51:42.010 --> 03:51:42.020 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:51:45.530 --> 03:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
primarily there are so many places in
 
03:51:49.790 --> 03:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
our laws our rules and town laws and
 
03:51:53.210 --> 03:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
rules that required uh
 
03:51:56.389 --> 03:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
a natural scientists to stamp this or
 
03:51:59.150 --> 03:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
seal this or sign for it and we didn't
 
03:52:01.969 --> 03:52:01.979 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
03:52:01.979 --> 03:52:03.290 align:start position:0%
believe that
um

03:52:03.290 --> 03:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:05.150 --> 03:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
we felt that if you're going to delete
 
03:52:06.710 --> 03:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
the license you have to address those
 
03:52:08.690 --> 03:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
issues there are some national
 
03:52:10.790 --> 03:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
certifications but they're not as
 
03:52:13.130 --> 03:52:13.140 align:start position:0%
standard as some people would like to
 
03:52:13.140 --> 03:52:14.030 align:start position:0%
standard as some people would like to
believe

03:52:14.030 --> 03:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
believe
 
03:52:16.010 --> 03:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe the Foresters really
 
03:52:18.229 --> 03:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
have National certification
 
03:52:20.690 --> 03:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
so we think that
 
03:52:23.750 --> 03:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
the the license is necessary until a
 
03:52:25.910 --> 03:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
little more groundwork's been done on
 
03:52:27.469 --> 03:52:27.479 align:start position:0%
all the places that call for these
 
03:52:27.479 --> 03:52:28.550 align:start position:0%
all the places that call for these
licenses

03:52:28.550 --> 03:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
03:52:30.349 --> 03:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
thank you I agree there are a lot of
 
03:52:33.110 --> 03:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
these things in in town ordinances and
 
03:52:36.950 --> 03:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
so on that that refer to these jobs and
 
03:52:38.870 --> 03:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
yeah the Wetland scientists in
 
03:52:41.750 --> 03:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
particular are all over everything land
 
03:52:47.750 --> 03:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
use boards sewers septic systems so
 
03:52:47.760 --> 03:52:49.450 align:start position:0%
use boards sewers septic systems so
and

03:52:49.450 --> 03:52:49.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:52:51.769 --> 03:52:51.779 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to go through and try and
 
03:52:55.309 --> 03:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
find those all those references
 
03:52:59.570 --> 03:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
so amendment five repeals the sections
 
03:53:02.269 --> 03:53:02.279 align:start position:0%
repealing Foresters Landscape Architects
 
03:53:07.490 --> 03:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
and natural scientists and adds in a
 
03:53:10.550 --> 03:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
simplified board combining for all three
 
03:53:10.560 --> 03:53:11.870 align:start position:0%
simplified board combining for all three
professions

03:53:11.870 --> 03:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
professions
 
03:53:14.750 --> 03:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
it probably won't make them happy but it
 
03:53:17.570 --> 03:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
does cover the details the requirements
 
03:53:19.910 --> 03:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
for the license are the same as in
 
03:53:21.530 --> 03:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
current statute
 
03:53:25.610 --> 03:53:25.620 align:start position:0%
and the exemptions are
 
03:53:28.130 --> 03:53:28.140 align:start position:0%
combined and clearer so that it's
 
03:53:30.050 --> 03:53:30.060 align:start position:0%
obvious that
 
03:53:33.229 --> 03:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
any of these licenses are not needed
 
03:53:35.570 --> 03:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
just to work in the profession you need
 
03:53:40.250 --> 03:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
it to be the lead of an organization
 
03:53:42.050 --> 03:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
the same way that the Professional
 
03:53:44.990 --> 03:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
Engineers license is needed by the lead
 
03:53:47.210 --> 03:53:47.220 align:start position:0%
of the organization and not necessarily
 
03:53:50.210 --> 03:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
every engineer who works
 
03:53:53.330 --> 03:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
under that person I mean I I was an
 
03:53:54.950 --> 03:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
engineer and I knew some people that
 
03:53:57.769 --> 03:53:57.779 align:start position:0%
went to get a professional engineer's
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
license but that is primarily for people
 
03:54:01.370 --> 03:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
who want to be in business for
 
03:54:01.380 --> 03:54:02.389 align:start position:0%
who want to be in business for
themselves

03:54:02.389 --> 03:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
03:54:04.729 --> 03:54:04.739 align:start position:0%
it's not for uh
 
03:54:06.650 --> 03:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
the thousands of Engineers working for
 
03:54:10.309 --> 03:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
the GE at Eric and the aircraft business
 
03:54:14.630 --> 03:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
so and the examinations make it clear
 
03:54:17.510 --> 03:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
that the employees don't need to be
 
03:54:20.389 --> 03:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
licensed government officials don't need
 
03:54:24.590 --> 03:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
to be licensed people don't need to be
 
03:54:24.600 --> 03:54:25.729 align:start position:0%
to be licensed people don't need to be
um

03:54:25.729 --> 03:54:25.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:29.150 --> 03:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
there's no double licensing required if
 
03:54:31.130 --> 03:54:31.140 align:start position:0%
you're a Forester
 
03:54:34.189 --> 03:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
you can deal or a soil scientist you can
 
03:54:36.170 --> 03:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
deal with things that are normally
 
03:54:38.830 --> 03:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
considered landscape architecture or
 
03:54:41.150 --> 03:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
professional engineering as long as it's
 
03:54:42.950 --> 03:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
in your scope of practice you don't need
 
03:54:44.450 --> 03:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
a double license
 
03:54:48.070 --> 03:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
and then there's some specific
 
03:54:51.889 --> 03:54:51.899 align:start position:0%
exemptions but for the most part it's as
 
03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
I said for the lead person and in an
 
03:54:56.990 --> 03:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
organization or somebody working for
 
03:54:57.000 --> 03:54:58.389 align:start position:0%
organization or somebody working for
themselves

03:54:58.389 --> 03:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
03:55:02.570 --> 03:55:02.580 align:start position:0%
and that was the intent
 
03:55:08.150 --> 03:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:10.250 --> 03:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh I just was told somebody in the
 
03:55:12.349 --> 03:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
audience had their hand raised yes
 
03:55:13.790 --> 03:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
they're good representative from
 
03:55:16.910 --> 03:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester we like to comment take the
 
03:55:19.490 --> 03:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
mic so everyone can hear you well I I
 
03:55:21.590 --> 03:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
just I have one only one other thing to
 
03:55:24.830 --> 03:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
say these recommendations were were
 
03:55:27.710 --> 03:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
essentially the consensus of Edna that
 
03:55:29.570 --> 03:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
they had to be addressed
 
03:55:32.030 --> 03:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
various other members have various other
 
03:55:34.189 --> 03:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
issues and there's I think four of them
 
03:55:37.309 --> 03:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
behind behind me bringing them to your
 
03:55:39.410 --> 03:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
attention uh
 
03:55:41.349 --> 03:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
but you'll
 
03:55:44.570 --> 03:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
these are as I said the consensus of the
 
03:55:46.910 --> 03:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
committee and we hope you hope you will
 
03:55:47.990 --> 03:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
support them
 
03:55:50.210 --> 03:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
so I I did have a question so we heard
 
03:55:53.450 --> 03:55:53.460 align:start position:0%
from a court reporter or maybe several
 
03:55:55.370 --> 03:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
them and going through some of these
 
03:55:57.710 --> 03:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
changes I noticed like real estate
 
03:56:00.290 --> 03:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
appraisers that they would that would be
 
03:56:02.090 --> 03:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
repealed and no the real estate
 
03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
appraisers got moved
 
03:56:07.429 --> 03:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
okay they are they are they are
 
03:56:13.309 --> 03:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
they're moving from the dra to oplc it
 
03:56:16.309 --> 03:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
was started last year when we created a
 
03:56:18.530 --> 03:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
specific board versus assessor
 
03:56:18.540 --> 03:56:19.849 align:start position:0%
specific board versus assessor
certification

03:56:19.849 --> 03:56:19.859 align:start position:0%
certification
 
03:56:22.490 --> 03:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
and this completes the the
 
03:56:25.790 --> 03:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
reorganization the licenses and training
 
03:56:29.689 --> 03:56:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:32.689 --> 03:56:32.699 align:start position:0%
yeah there are four boards that that are
 
03:56:35.870 --> 03:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
relocated the the assessors the
 
03:56:35.880 --> 03:56:37.429 align:start position:0%
relocated the the assessors the
Auctioneers

03:56:37.429 --> 03:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
Auctioneers
 
03:56:37.439 --> 03:56:40.490 align:start position:0%
Auctioneers
uh

03:56:40.490 --> 03:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:42.889 --> 03:56:42.899 align:start position:0%
interpreters for the Deaf
 
03:56:45.889 --> 03:56:45.899 align:start position:0%
that comes from education and the
 
03:56:47.689 --> 03:56:47.699 align:start position:0%
auctioneers board is from the Secretary
 
03:56:49.550 --> 03:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
of State
 
03:56:52.010 --> 03:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
but that though that language other than
 
03:56:55.070 --> 03:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
that one little slip up I saw looked
 
03:56:58.070 --> 03:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
looked reasonable and it's a they didn't
 
03:57:00.950 --> 03:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
need any addition
 
03:57:03.550 --> 03:57:03.560 align:start position:0%
now was there any discussion with the
 
03:57:06.530 --> 03:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
commissioner commissioner's step as far
 
03:57:08.510 --> 03:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
as moving
 
03:57:10.670 --> 03:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
the appraisers I I didn't look up these
 
03:57:12.590 --> 03:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
different statues but I know that anyone
 
03:57:16.130 --> 03:57:16.140 align:start position:0%
we talked with dra last year when we uh
 
03:57:18.889 --> 03:57:18.899 align:start position:0%
were dealing with the appraisers board I
 
03:57:20.630 --> 03:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
know the secretary of state is would be
 
03:57:22.130 --> 03:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
delighted to get rid of some of these
 
03:57:25.250 --> 03:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
boards oh with boxing and wrestling
 
03:57:27.769 --> 03:57:27.779 align:start position:0%
um they're they're not really a part of
 
03:57:30.229 --> 03:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
his organization so he's he thinks it
 
03:57:32.330 --> 03:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
should be there we didn't talk to
 
03:57:35.090 --> 03:57:35.100 align:start position:0%
education about the interpreters for the
 
03:57:37.849 --> 03:57:37.859 align:start position:0%
deaf but uh Theo PLC has no problem with
 
03:57:41.330 --> 03:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
it no I'm just curious about dra if you
 
03:57:43.070 --> 03:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
if someone spoke to the commissioner
 
03:57:45.229 --> 03:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
about moving
 
03:57:50.650 --> 03:57:50.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:53.750 --> 03:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
they had members of their organization
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
that is
 
03:57:57.830 --> 03:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
that our assessors and they worked with
 
03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
the assessing Standards Board the
 
03:58:01.969 --> 03:58:01.979 align:start position:0%
licensing of the actual assessors was
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
not something they really cared a whole
 
03:58:05.150 --> 03:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
lot about
 
03:58:08.330 --> 03:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
at least that was the impression I got
 
03:58:10.370 --> 03:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
so when your committee reviewed all
 
03:58:12.050 --> 03:58:12.060 align:start position:0%
these I assume you went down through
 
03:58:14.570 --> 03:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
each section and the company said this
 
03:58:16.550 --> 03:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
is a good thing or a bad thing or did
 
03:58:20.870 --> 03:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
you no we started with uh those of us
 
03:58:23.269 --> 03:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
who had poured over House Bill 2 in our
 
03:58:26.630 --> 03:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
free time and looked and brought up the
 
03:58:29.330 --> 03:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
issues we thought were important
 
03:58:31.849 --> 03:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
the court reporters were mentioned and
 
03:58:34.849 --> 03:58:34.859 align:start position:0%
one member is concerned about the light
 
03:58:37.250 --> 03:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
deleting the license but the rest of the
 
03:58:40.130 --> 03:58:40.140 align:start position:0%
committee did was not convinced to go
 
03:58:40.140 --> 03:58:41.030 align:start position:0%
committee did was not convinced to go
along

03:58:41.030 --> 03:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
along
 
03:58:42.830 --> 03:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
one member was concerned about
 
03:58:45.229 --> 03:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
consolidating the podiatrists into the
 
03:58:46.729 --> 03:58:46.739 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine
 
03:58:48.349 --> 03:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
but the rest of the committee didn't
 
03:58:50.090 --> 03:58:50.100 align:start position:0%
think that was a big deal
 
03:58:54.290 --> 03:58:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:56.689 --> 03:58:56.699 align:start position:0%
a couple of us went through this list
 
03:59:00.349 --> 03:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
and looked for problems and these are
 
03:59:01.910 --> 03:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
the ones that the committee agreed
 
03:59:05.090 --> 03:59:05.100 align:start position:0%
needed to be dealt with there are I
 
03:59:05.100 --> 03:59:05.929 align:start position:0%
needed to be dealt with there are I
wouldn't

03:59:05.929 --> 03:59:05.939 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
03:59:07.610 --> 03:59:07.620 align:start position:0%
venture to say that there are no
 
03:59:09.769 --> 03:59:09.779 align:start position:0%
problems with any of the other parts but
 
03:59:11.030 --> 03:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's certainly
 
03:59:13.309 --> 03:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh not having risen to the level of
 
03:59:13.319 --> 03:59:15.769 align:start position:0%
uh not having risen to the level of
these

03:59:15.769 --> 03:59:15.779 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:59:17.750 --> 03:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions for
 
03:59:19.309 --> 03:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
the chair of the Edna committee
 
03:59:22.070 --> 03:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative EPO so that was exactly
 
03:59:24.410 --> 03:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
the question I was going to ask you that
 
03:59:27.050 --> 03:59:27.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean that Edna has
 
03:59:29.570 --> 03:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
blessed all the other parts that you
 
03:59:32.150 --> 03:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
have not commented on but these were the
 
03:59:33.790 --> 03:59:33.800 align:start position:0%
things that you were particularly
 
03:59:36.769 --> 03:59:36.779 align:start position:0%
concerned about as a committee exactly
 
03:59:40.370 --> 03:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
okay and then I just have one on the on
 
03:59:44.090 --> 03:59:44.100 align:start position:0%
the Foresters Landscape Architects so
 
03:59:45.530 --> 03:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
this is
 
03:59:47.630 --> 03:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
are you saying each of them now have
 
03:59:49.969 --> 03:59:49.979 align:start position:0%
their own board and the recommendation
 
03:59:54.349 --> 03:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
of e-dna is to combine them under one
 
03:59:54.359 --> 03:59:56.389 align:start position:0%
of e-dna is to combine them under one
the

03:59:56.389 --> 03:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:59:58.429 --> 03:59:58.439 align:start position:0%
the amendment combines them into one
 
03:59:58.439 --> 03:59:59.389 align:start position:0%
the amendment combines them into one
board

03:59:59.389 --> 03:59:59.399 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:00:02.269 --> 04:00:02.279 align:start position:0%
there aren't a lot of soil scientists I
 
04:00:04.070 --> 04:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
think there's 30 there's a couple of
 
04:00:07.610 --> 04:00:07.620 align:start position:0%
hundred Wetland scientists there's not a
 
04:00:09.349 --> 04:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
lot of people in in and there's a
 
04:00:09.359 --> 04:00:10.689 align:start position:0%
lot of people in in and there's a
hundred

04:00:10.689 --> 04:00:10.699 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
04:00:13.610 --> 04:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
150 or so Landscape Architects they're
 
04:00:15.110 --> 04:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
they're not very large
 
04:00:19.070 --> 04:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
and so combining them since they worked
 
04:00:22.070 --> 04:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
together made made some sense and in
 
04:00:23.990 --> 04:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
view of the fact that the governor had
 
04:00:24.000 --> 04:00:25.010 align:start position:0%
view of the fact that the governor had
deleted

04:00:25.010 --> 04:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
deleted
 
04:00:27.349 --> 04:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
recommended deleting the license and the
 
04:00:27.359 --> 04:00:28.729 align:start position:0%
recommended deleting the license and the
board

04:00:28.729 --> 04:00:28.739 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:00:28.739 --> 04:00:30.050 align:start position:0%
board
um

04:00:30.050 --> 04:00:30.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:33.170 --> 04:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
you we thought we thought that combining
 
04:00:34.969 --> 04:00:34.979 align:start position:0%
the boards made sense
 
04:00:34.979 --> 04:00:36.769 align:start position:0%
the boards made sense
it's

04:00:36.769 --> 04:00:36.779 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:00:38.650 --> 04:00:38.660 align:start position:0%
you could also
 
04:00:40.969 --> 04:00:40.979 align:start position:0%
interpret it to say we should just
 
04:00:43.910 --> 04:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
delete the three sections that repeal
 
04:00:45.590 --> 04:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
all those boards and leave them as is
 
04:00:48.290 --> 04:00:48.300 align:start position:0%
that that's your choice okay
 
04:00:50.809 --> 04:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:00:52.550 --> 04:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
so Madam chair did you have any
 
04:00:55.210 --> 04:00:55.220 align:start position:0%
discussion about the number of public
 
04:00:58.250 --> 04:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
appointees that were eliminated there
 
04:01:00.530 --> 04:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
were a number of boards and public
 
04:01:00.540 --> 04:01:01.790 align:start position:0%
were a number of boards and public
members

04:01:01.790 --> 04:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:01:05.450 --> 04:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
a number of them were reduced those that
 
04:01:08.050 --> 04:01:08.060 align:start position:0%
is because those were
 
04:01:11.330 --> 04:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
regulatory boards converted to advisory
 
04:01:11.340 --> 04:01:12.469 align:start position:0%
regulatory boards converted to advisory
boards

04:01:12.469 --> 04:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
boards
 
04:01:16.790 --> 04:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
and that was particular for the smaller
 
04:01:18.530 --> 04:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
professions or the ones that have had
 
04:01:20.570 --> 04:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
the most difficulty filling their board
 
04:01:22.729 --> 04:01:22.739 align:start position:0%
or maintaining a quorum
 
04:01:26.870 --> 04:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
so that the administration and the
 
04:01:31.370 --> 04:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
rulemaking is directed to the office of
 
04:01:34.010 --> 04:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and The Advisory
 
04:01:37.490 --> 04:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
Board provides the technical backup to
 
04:01:39.889 --> 04:01:39.899 align:start position:0%
make sure that the
 
04:01:39.899 --> 04:01:40.849 align:start position:0%
make sure that the
um

04:01:40.849 --> 04:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:43.070 --> 04:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
concerns of the light of the profession
 
04:01:45.229 --> 04:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
are addressed properly
 
04:01:48.950 --> 04:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
and a public member is much less vital
 
04:01:53.150 --> 04:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:55.490 --> 04:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Dan McGuire
 
04:01:58.490 --> 04:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you so number one please stick
 
04:01:58.500 --> 04:01:59.650 align:start position:0%
thank you so number one please stick
around

04:01:59.650 --> 04:01:59.660 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:02:02.030 --> 04:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
because I'm sure other questions will
 
04:02:04.670 --> 04:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
come up or things but
 
04:02:07.670 --> 04:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
um just in general I think would you
 
04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
agree that what we've discovered is for
 
04:02:13.429 --> 04:02:13.439 align:start position:0%
some of these very small boards
 
04:02:13.439 --> 04:02:14.689 align:start position:0%
some of these very small boards
um

04:02:14.689 --> 04:02:14.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:16.729 --> 04:02:16.739 align:start position:0%
like for example The Midwives or
 
04:02:19.189 --> 04:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
something there's there's two or three
 
04:02:22.490 --> 04:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
dozen of them in the whole state and and
 
04:02:24.950 --> 04:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
therefore everybody knows everybody and
 
04:02:26.630 --> 04:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
it's harder for them to discipline each
 
04:02:26.640 --> 04:02:27.410 align:start position:0%
it's harder for them to discipline each
other

04:02:27.410 --> 04:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:02:29.750 --> 04:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
Etc and that's part of the reason that
 
04:02:32.630 --> 04:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
they're doing some moving some to oplc
 
04:02:35.150 --> 04:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
and making them advisory
 
04:02:38.030 --> 04:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
um that's part of it last year we in
 
04:02:41.330 --> 04:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 330 we dealt with converting
 
04:02:44.269 --> 04:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
a significant number of boards from
 
04:02:46.670 --> 04:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
regulatory to advisory
 
04:02:48.710 --> 04:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
partly for that
 
04:02:52.670 --> 04:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
and The Midwives were considered but
 
04:02:55.849 --> 04:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
uh were not did not actually become
 
04:02:59.450 --> 04:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
advisory but like you say it's uh
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
there's a Kate there's a problem with
 
04:03:03.530 --> 04:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
midwives so they can get a great many
 
04:03:05.929 --> 04:03:05.939 align:start position:0%
complaints and there are so few of them
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
in the state that it's very difficult to
 
04:03:09.670 --> 04:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
get a
 
04:03:13.010 --> 04:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
uh unbiased
 
04:03:13.020 --> 04:03:13.969 align:start position:0%
uh unbiased
um

04:03:13.969 --> 04:03:13.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:16.010 --> 04:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
judges that were
 
04:03:18.830 --> 04:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
when there is a complaint yeah and and a
 
04:03:20.990 --> 04:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
related thing is that we discovered that
 
04:03:23.150 --> 04:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
quite a few boards
 
04:03:25.309 --> 04:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
almost everyone licensed is actually
 
04:03:27.050 --> 04:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't live in New Hampshire so for
 
04:03:30.170 --> 04:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
example the Landscape Architects they
 
04:03:33.650 --> 04:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
have say 200 licensees but 42 live in
 
04:03:36.530 --> 04:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the other 150 are from
 
04:03:39.950 --> 04:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and so therefore creating a
 
04:03:43.070 --> 04:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
board of new hampshire-based is a little
 
04:03:47.210 --> 04:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
tougher right so uh it depends there I
 
04:03:49.130 --> 04:03:49.140 align:start position:0%
believe the Foresters Landscape
 
04:03:52.490 --> 04:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
Architects and natural scientists were
 
04:03:54.189 --> 04:03:54.199 align:start position:0%
considered for
 
04:03:56.870 --> 04:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
the license were considered for a
 
04:03:59.210 --> 04:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
removal in part because there were so
 
04:04:01.370 --> 04:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
few complaints
 
04:04:03.650 --> 04:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
that the board didn't need to spend a
 
04:04:05.570 --> 04:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
lot of time and effort disciplining them
 
04:04:08.210 --> 04:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
because they were very few issues with
 
04:04:11.889 --> 04:04:11.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:15.349 --> 04:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
so you raised the issue of discipline
 
04:04:17.990 --> 04:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
now a number of these boards had an
 
04:04:20.150 --> 04:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
advisory role as far as disciplinary
 
04:04:23.330 --> 04:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
action and I see that there's sections
 
04:04:25.370 --> 04:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
where the executive director has that
 
04:04:28.790 --> 04:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
complete Authority for Discipline Do you
 
04:04:30.530 --> 04:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
think that could be problematic if we
 
04:04:32.090 --> 04:04:32.100 align:start position:0%
didn't have a good director like we
 
04:04:34.070 --> 04:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
guess we have now or
 
04:04:36.889 --> 04:04:36.899 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe the director is going
 
04:04:39.250 --> 04:04:39.260 align:start position:0%
to be sitting as a judge on these cases
 
04:04:42.290 --> 04:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
the structure is that there will be a
 
04:04:45.170 --> 04:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
hearings officer there will be a
 
04:04:47.870 --> 04:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
investigator who is knowledgeable about
 
04:04:49.610 --> 04:04:49.620 align:start position:0%
the profession that's that's being
 
04:04:52.910 --> 04:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
investigated and that the here there
 
04:04:55.070 --> 04:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
will be hearings officers that can and
 
04:04:55.080 --> 04:04:57.290 align:start position:0%
will be hearings officers that can and
judge

04:04:57.290 --> 04:04:57.300 align:start position:0%
judge
 
04:05:00.729 --> 04:05:00.739 align:start position:0%
the cases on their Merit
 
04:05:03.229 --> 04:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
there were sections that that may not
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
hold quite true
 
04:05:09.469 --> 04:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
why which ones are you I'm looking at um
 
04:05:12.590 --> 04:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
on page 108 where it says
 
04:05:14.510 --> 04:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
it's crossed out board and it says the
 
04:05:16.790 --> 04:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
executive director May disa or take
 
04:05:19.729 --> 04:05:19.739 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action in any one or more
 
04:05:22.309 --> 04:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
of the following ways
 
04:05:25.550 --> 04:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh public or private reprimand by
 
04:05:30.290 --> 04:05:30.300 align:start position:0%
suspension license verification
 
04:05:34.090 --> 04:05:34.100 align:start position:0%
um yes that's the the under the the
 
04:05:37.309 --> 04:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
profession the
 
04:05:37.319 --> 04:05:38.090 align:start position:0%
profession the
um

04:05:38.090 --> 04:05:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
the issues about how that is done are
 
04:05:44.090 --> 04:05:44.100 align:start position:0%
covered under the under house bill 655
 
04:05:45.710 --> 04:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
the section we're taking out of house
 
04:05:49.010 --> 04:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
bill two there are how the investigation
 
04:05:51.889 --> 04:05:51.899 align:start position:0%
is to be done and how the hearings are
 
04:05:53.330 --> 04:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
to be uh
 
04:05:58.010 --> 04:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:01.130 --> 04:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you so I
 
04:06:02.689 --> 04:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
would just comment I mean
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
often in law it's the commissioner does
 
04:06:08.269 --> 04:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
something but really it's somebody who
 
04:06:10.189 --> 04:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
works for the commissioner who ends up
 
04:06:12.410 --> 04:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
doing that thing and I think this is
 
04:06:14.030 --> 04:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
similar right this would be the hearing
 
04:06:16.130 --> 04:06:16.140 align:start position:0%
officer who's actually making the
 
04:06:18.889 --> 04:06:18.899 align:start position:0%
decision and disciplining the the case
 
04:06:22.370 --> 04:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
if you look on line 25 it's it says
 
04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action under this paragraph
 
04:06:27.229 --> 04:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
may be ordered by the board after a
 
04:06:30.110 --> 04:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
hearing well the board's been removed it
 
04:06:33.950 --> 04:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
that's what my concern is that I think
 
04:06:38.929 --> 04:06:38.939 align:start position:0%
it's putting a lot of Authority in one
 
04:06:42.469 --> 04:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
individual whether he or she but
 
04:06:46.729 --> 04:06:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:48.469 --> 04:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
so that particular line looks like a
 
04:06:51.290 --> 04:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
technical music yeah it looks like line
 
04:06:51.300 --> 04:06:53.269 align:start position:0%
technical music yeah it looks like line
24.

04:06:53.269 --> 04:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
24.
 
04:06:53.279 --> 04:06:55.189 align:start position:0%
24.
um

04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:57.229 --> 04:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
that does look like an executive
 
04:06:59.809 --> 04:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
director so again that kind of language
 
04:07:01.610 --> 04:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
concerns me because you're putting an
 
04:07:03.830 --> 04:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
awful lot of authority and if someone
 
04:07:07.010 --> 04:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to appeal the decision I don't
 
04:07:10.010 --> 04:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
know if that's quite clear maybe this
 
04:07:12.170 --> 04:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
individual can set fines of up to two
 
04:07:13.790 --> 04:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:07:16.189 --> 04:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
so those are the things that just
 
04:07:17.809 --> 04:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
skimming through this earlier caught my
 
04:07:20.590 --> 04:07:20.600 align:start position:0%
attention I made little notes but I
 
04:07:22.610 --> 04:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
04:07:22.620 --> 04:07:26.229 align:start position:0%
believe that
um

04:07:26.229 --> 04:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:26.239 --> 04:07:28.150 align:start position:0%
 
those

04:07:28.150 --> 04:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:07:30.830 --> 04:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
disciplinary actions are typical of
 
04:07:33.170 --> 04:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
Licensing boards that's which one is
 
04:07:33.180 --> 04:07:34.309 align:start position:0%
Licensing boards that's which one is
this

04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
acupuncture yeah okay well again it was
 
04:07:40.429 --> 04:07:40.439 align:start position:0%
it's a board but not one individual it's
 
04:07:43.250 --> 04:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
a board of what a five or two or three
 
04:07:46.849 --> 04:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
versus one individual
 
04:07:49.550 --> 04:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
not just a concern I had Madam chair
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
um if you're if it's a criminal case
 
04:07:55.130 --> 04:07:55.140 align:start position:0%
you're going to have one judge unless
 
04:07:57.830 --> 04:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
you happen to have a jury in in many
 
04:08:00.710 --> 04:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
cases the the board is more of the jury
 
04:08:04.130 --> 04:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:07.729 --> 04:08:07.739 align:start position:0%
all right well I guess we can talk about
 
04:08:10.670 --> 04:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
that further about that than I do I'm
 
04:08:13.189 --> 04:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
afraid I'm not at all familiar with book
 
04:08:15.650 --> 04:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
with courts cases
 
04:08:17.689 --> 04:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
well I've sat on review boards before
 
04:08:20.269 --> 04:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
and just it's usually like a board of
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
several individuals a little Fair
 
04:08:24.290 --> 04:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
process than just one individual that's
 
04:08:27.290 --> 04:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
not a judge that's appointed by
 
04:08:30.349 --> 04:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
governor and executive Council but are
 
04:08:33.290 --> 04:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
there further questions well thanks
 
04:08:36.830 --> 04:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative grassy any comments yet
 
04:08:39.290 --> 04:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
representative cambrell's
 
04:08:41.929 --> 04:08:41.939 align:start position:0%
represent evil yes I had I had two we've
 
04:08:41.939 --> 04:08:43.070 align:start position:0%
represent evil yes I had I had two we've
gotten

04:08:43.070 --> 04:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
gotten
 
04:08:45.590 --> 04:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
um conflicting testimony on the
 
04:08:47.630 --> 04:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
acupuncture issue and I didn't know if
 
04:08:49.790 --> 04:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
you guys had talked about that
 
04:08:52.189 --> 04:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
uh we heard testimony from two different
 
04:08:54.170 --> 04:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
groups one of whom loves the changes and
 
04:08:55.750 --> 04:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
one of them hates them
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
and our usual practice in that case is
 
04:09:00.479 --> 04:09:01.670 align:start position:0%
and our usual practice in that case is
to

04:09:01.670 --> 04:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:09:04.189 --> 04:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
throw throw it throw the baby out with
 
04:09:05.689 --> 04:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
the bath water and say we're not gonna
 
04:09:08.210 --> 04:09:08.220 align:start position:0%
not gonna make a decision until you guys
 
04:09:12.229 --> 04:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
can figure out what your what the
 
04:09:14.530 --> 04:09:14.540 align:start position:0%
I mean is it somewhat it's a
 
04:09:17.689 --> 04:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
professional dispute and some of it is a
 
04:09:19.969 --> 04:09:19.979 align:start position:0%
complaint about the personalities
 
04:09:22.550 --> 04:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
and that those are always very difficult
 
04:09:24.769 --> 04:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
to enroute
 
04:09:26.929 --> 04:09:26.939 align:start position:0%
more I know a couple of people have been
 
04:09:29.030 --> 04:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
interested in the Hawker and Peddler
 
04:09:31.729 --> 04:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
license did you have a feeling on that
 
04:09:35.150 --> 04:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh yes we passed that last year
 
04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
in the house the repeal of that license
 
04:09:42.290 --> 04:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
it's the Secretary of State at that time
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
assured us that first of all they have
 
04:09:47.990 --> 04:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
never rejected anyone's license because
 
04:09:49.309 --> 04:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
of a criminal
 
04:09:51.110 --> 04:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
criminal background check they do the
 
04:09:52.610 --> 04:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
check and then they give them the
 
04:09:54.410 --> 04:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
license and they have never rejected
 
04:09:56.870 --> 04:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
anyone for any reason related to the
 
04:10:01.130 --> 04:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
background check and no one in
 
04:10:04.189 --> 04:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
decades at least has ever claimed the
 
04:10:07.250 --> 04:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
bond that is required to be posted so
 
04:10:10.370 --> 04:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
the Edna was convinced that this license
 
04:10:12.710 --> 04:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
really didn't do a whole lot except
 
04:10:14.809 --> 04:10:14.819 align:start position:0%
hassle the people who wanted
 
04:10:16.729 --> 04:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:10:16.739 --> 04:10:17.510 align:start position:0%
to do
um

04:10:17.510 --> 04:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:20.570 --> 04:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
hope to be Hawkers or Peddlers there are
 
04:10:23.990 --> 04:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
municipal licenses that are
 
04:10:26.990 --> 04:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
in many cases much more rigorous
 
04:10:33.469 --> 04:10:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:35.990 --> 04:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
so I guess uh we're all set all right
 
04:10:38.469 --> 04:10:38.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks Madam chair good job
 
04:10:41.090 --> 04:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
the representative from Manchester did I
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
see her
 
04:10:44.389 --> 04:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
hand up a little while ago
 
04:10:46.910 --> 04:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
you know this state your name for the
 
04:10:50.030 --> 04:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:52.550 --> 04:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
my name is Jane bolier a representative
 
04:10:56.330 --> 04:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
uh in from Manchester District 19. I
 
04:10:58.670 --> 04:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
serve on Commerce
 
04:11:02.269 --> 04:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
this year next year I do have and I'm
 
04:11:04.670 --> 04:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
not quite sure if I should be addressing
 
04:11:08.689 --> 04:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
this committee or another committee but
 
04:11:08.699 --> 04:11:10.969 align:start position:0%
this committee or another committee but
um

04:11:10.969 --> 04:11:10.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.469 --> 04:11:15.479 align:start position:0%
eight so 655 is a bill
 
04:11:17.570 --> 04:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
that was
 
04:11:20.510 --> 04:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
um introduced
 
04:11:25.070 --> 04:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
as a section of hb2 to be
 
04:11:26.630 --> 04:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
pulled out
 
04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
to be discussed
 
04:11:32.030 --> 04:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
and my question is is um
 
04:11:35.150 --> 04:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm a 50-year um
 
04:11:38.450 --> 04:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist and it looks like
 
04:11:40.670 --> 04:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
the license for cosmetologist is going
 
04:11:42.769 --> 04:11:42.779 align:start position:0%
to be repealed
 
04:11:46.070 --> 04:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
I think well if I could 655 was a
 
04:11:47.929 --> 04:11:47.939 align:start position:0%
standalone bill and I guess some of the
 
04:11:49.729 --> 04:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
sections have wandered into house bill
 
04:11:52.309 --> 04:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
too but again it's an awful lot of
 
04:12:02.630 --> 04:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:05.090 --> 04:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
Professional Regulation the study
 
04:12:06.610 --> 04:12:06.620 align:start position:0%
committee this summer
 
04:12:11.210 --> 04:12:11.220 align:start position:0%
we then when we found that it was
 
04:12:14.450 --> 04:12:14.460 align:start position:0%
we went to Edna we worked on it
 
04:12:17.269 --> 04:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
and as I said we beefed up some sections
 
04:12:19.130 --> 04:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
that needed some work
 
04:12:22.429 --> 04:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
04:12:22.439 --> 04:12:23.090 align:start position:0%
and then the
um

04:12:23.090 --> 04:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
then we'd noticed it in House Bill 2 and
 
04:12:27.110 --> 04:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
said let's not try and keep two two of
 
04:12:28.370 --> 04:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
them together
 
04:12:31.550 --> 04:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
none of them affect the cosmetologist's
 
04:12:33.889 --> 04:12:33.899 align:start position:0%
license except
 
04:12:37.729 --> 04:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
in-house Bill 2 it deletes the booth
 
04:12:37.739 --> 04:12:38.929 align:start position:0%
in-house Bill 2 it deletes the booth
license

04:12:38.929 --> 04:12:38.939 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:12:41.630 --> 04:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
none of the others all of the
 
04:12:44.090 --> 04:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
requirements for a cosmetologist an
 
04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
esthetician a barber a manicurist are
 
04:12:49.849 --> 04:12:49.859 align:start position:0%
the same it's only the additional Booth
 
04:12:49.859 --> 04:12:50.929 align:start position:0%
the same it's only the additional Booth
license

04:12:50.929 --> 04:12:50.939 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:12:54.170 --> 04:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
in addition to the uh
 
04:12:56.870 --> 04:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
a shop license could you tell us what
 
04:13:00.410 --> 04:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
you said a booth license well I I'm just
 
04:13:03.229 --> 04:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
curious I guess never been to it in many
 
04:13:05.570 --> 04:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh Beauty parlors for sure I don't know
 
04:13:09.110 --> 04:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
about Barbers but probably the owner of
 
04:13:13.250 --> 04:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
the facility has a license as a as a
 
04:13:16.269 --> 04:13:16.279 align:start position:0%
shop and as an individual
 
04:13:20.269 --> 04:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
licensed person and the people who are
 
04:13:22.490 --> 04:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
actually working at the chairs doing the
 
04:13:27.050 --> 04:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
work may be employees and
 
04:13:29.689 --> 04:13:29.699 align:start position:0%
or they may be independent contractors
 
04:13:29.699 --> 04:13:31.610 align:start position:0%
or they may be independent contractors
the

04:13:31.610 --> 04:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:13:34.910 --> 04:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
in either case the owner of the shop is
 
04:13:38.269 --> 04:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
responsible for the overall operation of
 
04:13:41.929 --> 04:13:41.939 align:start position:0%
the shop and the individuals doing the
 
04:13:44.150 --> 04:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
work are required to be licensed for the
 
04:13:45.410 --> 04:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
work they're doing
 
04:13:47.389 --> 04:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
and that none of that changes they just
 
04:13:49.790 --> 04:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
took the uh the booth license out
 
04:13:51.950 --> 04:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
because it's confusing because if you
 
04:13:53.389 --> 04:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
look online
 
04:13:56.750 --> 04:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
um it does there's 34 licenses that
 
04:13:58.429 --> 04:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
they're looking to repeal is that not
 
04:14:00.889 --> 04:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
correct right now and the booth license
 
04:14:02.630 --> 04:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
is the only one that falls under the
 
04:14:04.969 --> 04:14:04.979 align:start position:0%
Board of Cosmetology and
 
04:14:04.979 --> 04:14:06.050 align:start position:0%
Board of Cosmetology and
um

04:14:06.050 --> 04:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:09.170 --> 04:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
Natural Science scientists soil
 
04:14:11.450 --> 04:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
scientists Wetland scientist are you
 
04:14:14.030 --> 04:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
grouping those together
 
04:14:16.969 --> 04:14:16.979 align:start position:0%
the soil scientists and Wetland
 
04:14:19.130 --> 04:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
scientists are currently grouped
 
04:14:21.650 --> 04:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
together as natural scientists
 
04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
so you're not eliminating any of these
 
04:14:26.210 --> 04:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
licenses we're recommending to finance
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
that they
 
04:14:30.950 --> 04:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
repeal that they pull out that license
 
04:14:30.960 --> 04:14:32.809 align:start position:0%
repeal that they pull out that license
deletion

04:14:32.809 --> 04:14:32.819 align:start position:0%
deletion
 
04:14:32.819 --> 04:14:34.729 align:start position:0%
deletion
okay

04:14:34.729 --> 04:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:14:38.689 --> 04:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
so how many of the 34 that are listed
 
04:14:42.410 --> 04:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
are going to be repealed
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
because if you look online it still
 
04:14:45.830 --> 04:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
looks like all of these are going to be
 
04:14:47.990 --> 04:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
repealed you won't see any changes to
 
04:14:49.849 --> 04:14:49.859 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 until after it's been
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
changed by finance and by the house so
 
04:14:56.689 --> 04:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:58.610 --> 04:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
04:15:00.769 --> 04:15:00.779 align:start position:0%
because there's so many changes here and
 
04:15:03.889 --> 04:15:03.899 align:start position:0%
we've been inundated but with folks with
 
04:15:06.290 --> 04:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
concerns that would like a lot of things
 
04:15:07.729 --> 04:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
to say and some there's been some
 
04:15:09.349 --> 04:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
support for some of the things that have
 
04:15:12.530 --> 04:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
been suggested within House Bill too but
 
04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
we as Finance right division one right
 
04:15:17.870 --> 04:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
we have to make a recommendation whether
 
04:15:20.809 --> 04:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
we accept what chairman McGuire has
 
04:15:23.870 --> 04:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
advocated for or do we throw the whole
 
04:15:25.550 --> 04:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
thing out or do we make some changes
 
04:15:27.710 --> 04:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
ourselves but traditionally when
 
04:15:29.990 --> 04:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
something comes to us it has policy
 
04:15:32.389 --> 04:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
major policy change like this we send it
 
04:15:34.429 --> 04:15:34.439 align:start position:0%
to the policy committee
 
04:15:38.110 --> 04:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
for their review and comment so once we
 
04:15:40.429 --> 04:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
absorb all of this information we're
 
04:15:43.189 --> 04:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
getting today and we will make a
 
04:15:45.110 --> 04:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full finance
 
04:15:46.610 --> 04:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
committee in a week
 
04:15:46.620 --> 04:15:47.809 align:start position:0%
committee in a week
so

04:15:47.809 --> 04:15:47.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:50.210 --> 04:15:50.220 align:start position:0%
so it's it will be ultimately our
 
04:15:51.469 --> 04:15:51.479 align:start position:0%
decision but we're looking for
 
04:15:53.870 --> 04:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations from e-dna right because
 
04:15:55.610 --> 04:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
I mean the reason why I'm here is it's
 
04:15:56.929 --> 04:15:56.939 align:start position:0%
going to affect
 
04:16:01.750 --> 04:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
thousands of people in businesses and
 
04:16:03.830 --> 04:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's been enough
 
04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the general public or
 
04:16:08.389 --> 04:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
residents in the state to really
 
04:16:08.399 --> 04:16:09.370 align:start position:0%
residents in the state to really
understand

04:16:09.370 --> 04:16:09.380 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:16:12.229 --> 04:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
what this is all about I mean how is
 
04:16:14.290 --> 04:16:14.300 align:start position:0%
this going to affect them their business
 
04:16:18.170 --> 04:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
their child the college you know I
 
04:16:19.490 --> 04:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
04:16:21.830 --> 04:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
no you raised some very valid points and
 
04:16:23.689 --> 04:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
that was our concern when we first got
 
04:16:26.269 --> 04:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
it because it contains like I mentioned
 
04:16:30.729 --> 04:16:30.739 align:start position:0%
earlier hundreds of changes which
 
04:16:33.349 --> 04:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
weren't in my just speaking for myself
 
04:16:36.050 --> 04:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
weren't properly aired in the
 
04:16:37.849 --> 04:16:37.859 align:start position:0%
traditional way before a policy
 
04:16:40.189 --> 04:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
committee right and it's oftentimes
 
04:16:42.229 --> 04:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
you'll see this in a Governor's budget
 
04:16:45.530 --> 04:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
with a Visa policy suggested changes but
 
04:16:47.870 --> 04:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
there's never been anything to this
 
04:16:51.349 --> 04:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
magnitude because in my right terms here
 
04:16:54.590 --> 04:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and I I've never seen it either
 
04:17:00.229 --> 04:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:02.090 --> 04:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
so I think representative McGuire may
 
04:17:04.370 --> 04:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
have a question for you well I I to
 
04:17:06.110 --> 04:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
answer your question which I don't think
 
04:17:07.670 --> 04:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
I heard yet
 
04:17:11.090 --> 04:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
um from the original list of 34 I think
 
04:17:12.550 --> 04:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
it was yes
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
like seven six or seven
 
04:17:18.410 --> 04:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
if you if we pass rep representative
 
04:17:21.110 --> 04:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
Carol McGuire's suggestions six or seven
 
04:17:23.630 --> 04:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
would not be eliminated correct so that
 
04:17:25.790 --> 04:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
leaves like 28 or something like that
 
04:17:29.150 --> 04:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
there are of those 28 I think 12 of them
 
04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
are temporary licenses and so and most
 
04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
of the others are things like the
 
04:17:36.170 --> 04:17:36.180 align:start position:0%
Hawkers and Peddlers
 
04:17:36.180 --> 04:17:38.689 align:start position:0%
Hawkers and Peddlers
um

04:17:38.689 --> 04:17:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:41.150 --> 04:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
that was repealed
 
04:17:46.969 --> 04:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:49.550 --> 04:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
oh yes so it's back here in the house
 
04:17:52.070 --> 04:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
built too okay
 
04:17:55.969 --> 04:17:55.979 align:start position:0%
um the athlete agents of which there are
 
04:17:58.010 --> 04:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
three or four or five or something like
 
04:17:58.020 --> 04:17:59.450 align:start position:0%
three or four or five or something like
that

04:17:59.450 --> 04:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:18:01.969 --> 04:18:01.979 align:start position:0%
um and a handful and if you know I'm
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
talking about the cosmetology license
 
04:18:06.349 --> 04:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
Barbarian cosmetology and Aesthetics so
 
04:18:08.929 --> 04:18:08.939 align:start position:0%
there's not again it's only the booth
 
04:18:08.939 --> 04:18:10.429 align:start position:0%
there's not again it's only the booth
license

04:18:10.429 --> 04:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
not the cosmetology not the barber not
 
04:18:13.920 --> 04:18:14.750 align:start position:0%
not the cosmetology not the barber not
the

04:18:14.750 --> 04:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:18:18.110 --> 04:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
all that's here is the booth license so
 
04:18:20.570 --> 04:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
the separate license for the chair
 
04:18:22.610 --> 04:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
yes that's somebody I understand yeah
 
04:18:24.769 --> 04:18:24.779 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's it that's the only one
 
04:18:28.250 --> 04:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
so so the cosmetology license so the
 
04:18:34.010 --> 04:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
schools the cosmetology schools all that
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
stuff is the same no change
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
yes yeah
 
04:18:41.269 --> 04:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
go ahead Jackie yeah representative
 
04:18:41.279 --> 04:18:43.429 align:start position:0%
go ahead Jackie yeah representative
groda

04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
groda
 
04:18:45.050 --> 04:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
I think I believe representative groder
 
04:18:52.429 --> 04:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:55.010 --> 04:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
my name is Jackie groda I am a member of
 
04:18:57.650 --> 04:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
Edna and I've been a member of the Edna
 
04:19:00.410 --> 04:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
committee for all three terms that I've
 
04:19:01.790 --> 04:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
been in the house
 
04:19:04.210 --> 04:19:04.220 align:start position:0%
I also sit on gel car
 
04:19:06.769 --> 04:19:06.779 align:start position:0%
I want to assure
 
04:19:06.779 --> 04:19:08.510 align:start position:0%
I want to assure
um

04:19:08.510 --> 04:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:12.650 --> 04:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
representative build here that
 
04:19:15.590 --> 04:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
um cosmetology licenses barbering
 
04:19:19.849 --> 04:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and estheticians have not
 
04:19:24.530 --> 04:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
deleted repealed it's only the chair of
 
04:19:27.650 --> 04:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
someone in a cosmetology who who is in a
 
04:19:27.660 --> 04:19:28.670 align:start position:0%
someone in a cosmetology who who is in a
salon

04:19:28.670 --> 04:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
salon
 
04:19:31.309 --> 04:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
but I really would like to it this is I
 
04:19:33.710 --> 04:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
would like to approach the committee and
 
04:19:36.110 --> 04:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
talk with you about a few things if it's
 
04:19:39.110 --> 04:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:42.410 --> 04:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
okay I hadn't okay
 
04:19:45.229 --> 04:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
so I'm in looking at representative
 
04:19:45.239 --> 04:19:48.050 align:start position:0%
so I'm in looking at representative
McGuire's

04:19:48.050 --> 04:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
McGuire's
 
04:19:50.150 --> 04:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
um amendments I think it's important
 
04:19:53.450 --> 04:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
that I confirm with you
 
04:19:56.570 --> 04:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the discussions that
 
04:19:58.370 --> 04:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
we had because
 
04:20:00.229 --> 04:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
um I said I would I chaired the
 
04:20:03.349 --> 04:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on House Bill 655 we had
 
04:20:05.689 --> 04:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
two subcommittee meetings
 
04:20:09.769 --> 04:20:09.779 align:start position:0%
I also participated last Friday in the
 
04:20:12.590 --> 04:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
work session that the committee had on
 
04:20:14.769 --> 04:20:14.779 align:start position:0%
House Bill 655.
 
04:20:18.050 --> 04:20:18.060 align:start position:0%
655 is a massive bill
 
04:20:21.830 --> 04:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
and even for those on Edna it is a large
 
04:20:21.840 --> 04:20:23.150 align:start position:0%
and even for those on Edna it is a large
undertaking

04:20:23.150 --> 04:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
undertaking
 
04:20:27.050 --> 04:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
knowing that we do this all the time
 
04:20:30.290 --> 04:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
so I want to agree with the Amendments
 
04:20:32.349 --> 04:20:32.359 align:start position:0%
that representative McGuire
 
04:20:37.429 --> 04:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:37.439 --> 04:20:38.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:20:38.510 --> 04:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:42.469 --> 04:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about and also
 
04:20:42.479 --> 04:20:43.370 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about and also
um

04:20:43.370 --> 04:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:45.170 --> 04:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
04:20:48.410 --> 04:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
in number two the board of Mental Health
 
04:20:51.710 --> 04:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
and I want to caution you on the merging
 
04:20:53.030 --> 04:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
of boards
 
04:20:56.210 --> 04:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
because the board of psychology was
 
04:20:57.769 --> 04:20:57.779 align:start position:0%
separated from the Mental Health Board
 
04:21:00.650 --> 04:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
some time ago and now we're merging it
 
04:21:04.849 --> 04:21:04.859 align:start position:0%
back and this is where the question is
 
04:21:07.130 --> 04:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
and why we want to pull it out because
 
04:21:08.990 --> 04:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
there was a considerable amount of time
 
04:21:11.809 --> 04:21:11.819 align:start position:0%
spent when these boards were not were
 
04:21:11.819 --> 04:21:13.790 align:start position:0%
spent when these boards were not were
separate

04:21:13.790 --> 04:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
separate
 
04:21:16.010 --> 04:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
but and so I agree with her that we want
 
04:21:17.689 --> 04:21:17.699 align:start position:0%
to pull out that section we recommend
 
04:21:19.610 --> 04:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
that you pull out that section of House
 
04:21:21.410 --> 04:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
built 2.
 
04:21:24.889 --> 04:21:24.899 align:start position:0%
now there was a very clear
 
04:21:27.349 --> 04:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
message because we voted
 
04:21:29.570 --> 04:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
and one of the vote one of the part of
 
04:21:33.410 --> 04:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
our vote was to re to remove the LNA
 
04:21:36.650 --> 04:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
repeal from house bill 2. there's no
 
04:21:39.349 --> 04:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
question about that vote
 
04:21:42.110 --> 04:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
we don't believe that lnas should
 
04:21:45.769 --> 04:21:45.779 align:start position:0%
licenses should be repealed
 
04:21:49.010 --> 04:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
we also agreed that we thought
 
04:21:51.590 --> 04:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
forrester's landsaker Architects soil
 
04:21:54.710 --> 04:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
scientists Wetland scientists should be
 
04:21:57.710 --> 04:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
those repeals should be removed
 
04:22:00.950 --> 04:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
we did not agree on the merging of them
 
04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
in a board
 
04:22:06.170 --> 04:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
we only discussed representative Maguire
 
04:22:08.750 --> 04:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
said she was working on something mind
 
04:22:11.150 --> 04:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
you we've never seen this until today
 
04:22:13.729 --> 04:22:13.739 align:start position:0%
but we did not agree to merge it in any
 
04:22:15.530 --> 04:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
specific board we talked about putting
 
04:22:17.809 --> 04:22:17.819 align:start position:0%
it together in a technical board but
 
04:22:20.510 --> 04:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
that was something up for discussion
 
04:22:24.349 --> 04:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
we kept House Bill 518 as a retained
 
04:22:27.050 --> 04:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
bill so that any non-germaine amendment
 
04:22:28.790 --> 04:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
that we made in relationship to House
 
04:22:36.229 --> 04:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
I do want to also make some statements
 
04:22:41.090 --> 04:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
about the repealing of additional
 
04:22:43.670 --> 04:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
now mind you
 
04:22:48.050 --> 04:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
this takes some time to research because
 
04:22:50.330 --> 04:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
there are so many regulations that
 
04:22:52.490 --> 04:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
involve oplc
 
04:22:58.070 --> 04:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
but I want to pick out two right now
 
04:23:02.330 --> 04:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
last year because of the activity on
 
04:23:05.570 --> 04:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
some of the boards we agreed to change
 
04:23:07.790 --> 04:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
the board of Medical Imaging and
 
04:23:10.969 --> 04:23:10.979 align:start position:0%
radiation therapy to an Advisory Board
 
04:23:15.469 --> 04:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
that was done through house bill 1018.
 
04:23:18.650 --> 04:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
today the gel the rules for the this
 
04:23:21.170 --> 04:23:21.180 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board were on gel Carr's agenda
 
04:23:23.630 --> 04:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
under the consent calendar
 
04:23:26.330 --> 04:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
the governor signed that bill
 
04:23:29.570 --> 04:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
in on July of 2022.
 
04:23:32.510 --> 04:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
and here we are today repealing the
 
04:23:35.090 --> 04:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
licenses for that profession
 
04:23:37.429 --> 04:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
last we also did the same thing with the
 
04:23:40.309 --> 04:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
board of court reporters we also changed
 
04:23:42.710 --> 04:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
them to an Advisory Board underneath
 
04:23:45.530 --> 04:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1182 that was signed in May
 
04:23:47.870 --> 04:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
of 2022.
 
04:23:50.450 --> 04:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
the rules for this the rules were
 
04:23:53.269 --> 04:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
approved today in Jill Carr on a consent
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
calendar and again A year later less
 
04:23:57.830 --> 04:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
than a year later here we are repealing
 
04:24:00.170 --> 04:24:00.180 align:start position:0%
the licensing for this profession
 
04:24:03.050 --> 04:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
so in testimony one of the professions
 
04:24:06.290 --> 04:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
in both the testimony on House Bill 655
 
04:24:09.530 --> 04:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 2 the comments from the
 
04:24:11.809 --> 04:24:11.819 align:start position:0%
professionals who were being converted
 
04:24:14.330 --> 04:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
to The Advisory boards saying that this
 
04:24:16.370 --> 04:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
was just a transition to eventually
 
04:24:18.950 --> 04:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
repealing of their licenses
 
04:24:22.429 --> 04:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
now that may be or that may not be but I
 
04:24:24.769 --> 04:24:24.779 align:start position:0%
can assure you that the house does not
 
04:24:27.410 --> 04:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
want to lose the trust of the people who
 
04:24:33.229 --> 04:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
send us here with our responsibilities
 
04:24:35.150 --> 04:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
we've seen this with the retirement
 
04:24:38.330 --> 04:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
system and I really would caution you
 
04:24:42.710 --> 04:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:42.720 --> 04:24:43.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:24:43.849 --> 04:24:43.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:43.859 --> 04:24:45.410 align:start position:0%
um
now

04:24:45.410 --> 04:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:24:45.420 --> 04:24:46.070 align:start position:0%
now
um

04:24:46.070 --> 04:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:48.229 --> 04:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
merging of the boards
 
04:24:51.229 --> 04:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
merging the Board of Medicine with the
 
04:24:53.870 --> 04:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
medical review subcommittee and the
 
04:24:56.150 --> 04:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
board of Podiatry
 
04:24:57.710 --> 04:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine and the medical
 
04:25:00.410 --> 04:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
review board are separated for specific
 
04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
reasons the medical review board is the
 
04:25:04.849 --> 04:25:04.859 align:start position:0%
investigating arm of medical complaints
 
04:25:07.370 --> 04:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
while adjudication is done by the Board
 
04:25:08.450 --> 04:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
of Medicine
 
04:25:10.309 --> 04:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
it's important that these elements
 
04:25:13.670 --> 04:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
remain separate
 
04:25:17.870 --> 04:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
and in hb2 they're merged
 
04:25:21.530 --> 04:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
also Podiatry is very much against this
 
04:25:21.540 --> 04:25:22.670 align:start position:0%
also Podiatry is very much against this
merger

04:25:22.670 --> 04:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
merger
 
04:25:26.090 --> 04:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:29.330 --> 04:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
the the resistance
 
04:25:31.309 --> 04:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
but when there's this much resistance to
 
04:25:33.469 --> 04:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
something it's usually something that's
 
04:25:35.570 --> 04:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
worth a discussion
 
04:25:37.370 --> 04:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
and I guess what I'm saying to you is
 
04:25:38.809 --> 04:25:38.819 align:start position:0%
that there's so many components of House
 
04:25:41.269 --> 04:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 that are similar to this let's
 
04:25:42.889 --> 04:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
just look at the disciplinary action
 
04:25:46.189 --> 04:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
alone it helps Bill 655 the subcommittee
 
04:25:48.710 --> 04:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
hearing a significant portion of it was
 
04:25:51.649 --> 04:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
about the resistance of eliminating this
 
04:25:54.530 --> 04:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
disciplinary actions of the board
 
04:25:56.750 --> 04:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
maybe that there's another way of doing
 
04:26:00.769 --> 04:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
this in a less drastic way so that and
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that oplc is
 
04:26:07.370 --> 04:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
an agency that can't manage this
 
04:26:11.149 --> 04:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
I have respect for the people of oplc
 
04:26:11.159 --> 04:26:12.410 align:start position:0%
I have respect for the people of oplc
however

04:26:12.410 --> 04:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:26:14.090 --> 04:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
this is not something that I think
 
04:26:16.070 --> 04:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
should be this is these are policy
 
04:26:20.630 --> 04:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:23.210 --> 04:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
um so what I share with you in an
 
04:26:25.370 --> 04:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
organized but different manner than
 
04:26:26.990 --> 04:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 2.
 
04:26:30.349 --> 04:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
is an overview of perhaps the unintended
 
04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
consequences that could result
 
04:26:34.490 --> 04:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
and I recommend a targeted and
 
04:26:36.530 --> 04:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
thoughtful approach to this legislation
 
04:26:39.590 --> 04:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
that takes more time than we have if we
 
04:26:41.510 --> 04:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
want to do it correctly
 
04:26:46.269 --> 04:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:49.610 --> 04:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
very helpful thanks for your comments
 
04:26:52.130 --> 04:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
and recommendations
 
04:26:52.140 --> 04:26:53.050 align:start position:0%
and recommendations
um

04:26:53.050 --> 04:26:53.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:55.309 --> 04:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
representative evil I believe has a
 
04:26:57.769 --> 04:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
question right so I think I I really
 
04:27:00.229 --> 04:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate your specific comments but
 
04:27:00.239 --> 04:27:01.910 align:start position:0%
appreciate your specific comments but
overall

04:27:01.910 --> 04:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
overall
 
04:27:04.370 --> 04:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
um I just want to reiterate what I
 
04:27:07.429 --> 04:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
believe I'm hearing in your expertise on
 
04:27:10.309 --> 04:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
Edna and reviewing this you basically
 
04:27:12.590 --> 04:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
think this is too much too fast and you
 
04:27:15.110 --> 04:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
think all of it should have a lot more
 
04:27:15.120 --> 04:27:17.030 align:start position:0%
think all of it should have a lot more
analysis

04:27:17.030 --> 04:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
04:27:19.670 --> 04:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
well I'm not gonna you know argue over
 
04:27:23.210 --> 04:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
Peddlers and Hawkers right but there are
 
04:27:25.550 --> 04:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
many components about this that should
 
04:27:38.809 --> 04:27:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
I just have one one question at some
 
04:27:43.729 --> 04:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
point could you give us the bill that
 
04:27:46.910 --> 04:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
the house the bill number of the uh that
 
04:27:49.910 --> 04:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
the house passed on Hawkers and Peddlers
 
04:27:51.590 --> 04:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
sure okay
 
04:27:55.490 --> 04:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
and I'll be glad to send to you my notes
 
04:27:59.090 --> 04:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:01.670 --> 04:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
we'd appreciate that so I raised a
 
04:28:04.370 --> 04:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
question earlier with the chairman about
 
04:28:07.010 --> 04:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
the disciplinary Factor
 
04:28:10.010 --> 04:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
could you comment on that does it in my
 
04:28:11.870 --> 04:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
way off base that you have one
 
04:28:14.330 --> 04:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
individual overseeing disciplinary
 
04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
action or
 
04:28:17.809 --> 04:28:17.819 align:start position:0%
well I don't think it would be one
 
04:28:20.269 --> 04:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
individual I think it would be
 
04:28:23.269 --> 04:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
um and this is the part where I'm not I
 
04:28:25.490 --> 04:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
don't know what the system would be
 
04:28:27.710 --> 04:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
so this is the kind of discussion that
 
04:28:29.689 --> 04:28:29.699 align:start position:0%
we would have to have
 
04:28:29.699 --> 04:28:32.210 align:start position:0%
we would have to have
thanks

04:28:32.210 --> 04:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:28:34.849 --> 04:28:34.859 align:start position:0%
um I just the director one I see or he
 
04:28:45.950 --> 04:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:48.410 --> 04:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to do an overview of
 
04:28:50.330 --> 04:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
what's in House Bill 2 if you would
 
04:28:51.950 --> 04:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
think that would be helpful but specific
 
04:28:55.010 --> 04:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
to the disciplinary issues
 
04:28:58.670 --> 04:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
right now the way it works is that for
 
04:29:00.830 --> 04:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
boards that are independent regulatory
 
04:29:02.570 --> 04:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
bodies which are the large majority of
 
04:29:03.889 --> 04:29:03.899 align:start position:0%
our boards the boards that aren't
 
04:29:05.570 --> 04:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
advisory boards
 
04:29:09.050 --> 04:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
all of them use the hearings officer and
 
04:29:11.210 --> 04:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
the hearings officer helps facilitate
 
04:29:12.729 --> 04:29:12.739 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
04:29:12.739 --> 04:29:14.349 align:start position:0%
the hearing
and

04:29:14.349 --> 04:29:14.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:29:16.849 --> 04:29:16.859 align:start position:0%
assists with ruling on evidentiary
 
04:29:16.859 --> 04:29:18.250 align:start position:0%
assists with ruling on evidentiary
motions

04:29:18.250 --> 04:29:18.260 align:start position:0%
motions
 
04:29:22.309 --> 04:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
but the issue is that it is truly the
 
04:29:24.530 --> 04:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
board that has the authority to rule on
 
04:29:27.410 --> 04:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
evidential emotions and make findings or
 
04:29:29.630 --> 04:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry rulings of law
 
04:29:32.030 --> 04:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
boards by and large are not attorneys
 
04:29:33.769 --> 04:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
and they're not necessarily qualified to
 
04:29:36.469 --> 04:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
be making legal decisions on evidentiary
 
04:29:39.769 --> 04:29:39.779 align:start position:0%
matters and so a lot of those boards all
 
04:29:41.510 --> 04:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
of the boards have essentially delegated
 
04:29:43.969 --> 04:29:43.979 align:start position:0%
that to the hearings officer and the
 
04:29:46.670 --> 04:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
boards make the findings of fact for
 
04:29:46.680 --> 04:29:48.530 align:start position:0%
boards make the findings of fact for
example

04:29:48.530 --> 04:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:29:51.229 --> 04:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
um the facts alleged in a professional
 
04:29:54.410 --> 04:29:54.420 align:start position:0%
misconduct case are that the nurse
 
04:29:56.689 --> 04:29:56.699 align:start position:0%
diverted fentanyl the board will make
 
04:29:58.729 --> 04:29:58.739 align:start position:0%
the finding that the nurse did divert
 
04:30:00.950 --> 04:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and the hearings officer will
 
04:30:03.110 --> 04:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
will draw the legal conclusion that the
 
04:30:05.269 --> 04:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
diversion of fentanyl is professional
 
04:30:08.149 --> 04:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
misconduct based both on the finding
 
04:30:10.670 --> 04:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
effect by the Board of Nursing and the
 
04:30:13.790 --> 04:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
expert testimony that was provided in
 
04:30:15.590 --> 04:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the expertise of the
 
04:30:17.510 --> 04:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
board members with respect to the
 
04:30:19.969 --> 04:30:19.979 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board the process works the
 
04:30:22.729 --> 04:30:22.739 align:start position:0%
same way except technically the
 
04:30:25.070 --> 04:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
authority Rises up to the executive
 
04:30:27.349 --> 04:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
director the hearings officer presides
 
04:30:28.910 --> 04:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
over the hearing The Advisory Board
 
04:30:31.849 --> 04:30:31.859 align:start position:0%
provides a consultation the reason why
 
04:30:34.670 --> 04:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
this is helpful in our perspective is
 
04:30:35.809 --> 04:30:35.819 align:start position:0%
particularly when you get to those
 
04:30:38.689 --> 04:30:38.699 align:start position:0%
smaller boards and the boards have full
 
04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
control over disciplinary matters we
 
04:30:43.550 --> 04:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
have observed issues where people know
 
04:30:45.530 --> 04:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
everybody everybody knows everybody and
 
04:30:47.210 --> 04:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
they may choose not to discipline
 
04:30:50.929 --> 04:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
somebody because they like the person
 
04:30:53.510 --> 04:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
um and that obviously uh is not a
 
04:30:55.969 --> 04:30:55.979 align:start position:0%
legitimate legal conclusion so
 
04:30:57.830 --> 04:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
um from our perspective and this is what
 
04:31:01.910 --> 04:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
655 recommended that uh the person who's
 
04:31:03.830 --> 04:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
qualified usually in a trained attorney
 
04:31:07.250 --> 04:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
makes rulings of law and the board who
 
04:31:09.649 --> 04:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
are experts makes findings in fact and
 
04:31:11.870 --> 04:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
the analysis is conducted based on based
 
04:31:13.070 --> 04:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
on that so we already have that
 
04:31:15.410 --> 04:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
framework representative
 
04:31:17.389 --> 04:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
um but if you don't mind I'd be happy to
 
04:31:20.450 --> 04:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
go through an overview of postable too
 
04:31:22.849 --> 04:31:22.859 align:start position:0%
well just backing up to the language I
 
04:31:25.130 --> 04:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
referenced before sure it makes it very
 
04:31:27.530 --> 04:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
clear that board has been strickened in
 
04:31:29.689 --> 04:31:29.699 align:start position:0%
a number of spots and it says the
 
04:31:31.610 --> 04:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
executive director makes those decisions
 
04:31:33.950 --> 04:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
and you just kept referring to the board
 
04:31:36.769 --> 04:31:36.779 align:start position:0%
the board the board but throughout this
 
04:31:38.809 --> 04:31:38.819 align:start position:0%
document it says the executive director
 
04:31:41.389 --> 04:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
and board is crossed out I think you're
 
04:31:43.010 --> 04:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
probably referring to the boards that
 
04:31:44.929 --> 04:31:44.939 align:start position:0%
are being proposed to be converted to
 
04:31:47.929 --> 04:31:47.939 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board and we have six or seven
 
04:31:51.410 --> 04:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
of those six now and the language is
 
04:31:53.090 --> 04:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
nearly identical and it's already
 
04:31:56.630 --> 04:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
functioning in that capacity
 
04:31:59.269 --> 04:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
so you're obvious to be aware of the
 
04:32:01.010 --> 04:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
concerns that these changes since
 
04:32:02.809 --> 04:32:02.819 align:start position:0%
there's some support we heard from the
 
04:32:04.370 --> 04:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office there are
 
04:32:06.889 --> 04:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
some smaller agencies that he'd be happy
 
04:32:09.370 --> 04:32:09.380 align:start position:0%
to move to your
 
04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
licensure board
 
04:32:14.269 --> 04:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
but why didn't this go through the
 
04:32:17.389 --> 04:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
normal process of a review by the policy
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee well I think I'm sorry it's
 
04:32:24.410 --> 04:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
such a major change you know obviously
 
04:32:26.630 --> 04:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
um again some things are probably good
 
04:32:28.849 --> 04:32:28.859 align:start position:0%
and some things are not but
 
04:32:31.010 --> 04:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
I think and again just speaking for
 
04:32:33.469 --> 04:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
myself I think it's a little unfair to
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
put something like this before
 
04:32:39.950 --> 04:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
Finance with such little time
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
to really review it thoroughly because I
 
04:32:44.929 --> 04:32:44.939 align:start position:0%
can speak for this division over the
 
04:32:46.729 --> 04:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
years we try to be very thorough in
 
04:32:49.729 --> 04:32:49.739 align:start position:0%
whatever decisions we make we try to you
 
04:32:51.349 --> 04:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
know be thoughtful and listen to both
 
04:32:53.689 --> 04:32:53.699 align:start position:0%
sides but this gives us so such a little
 
04:32:57.590 --> 04:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
time to really review these thoroughly
 
04:32:59.630 --> 04:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
um so can you speak to that why this
 
04:33:01.610 --> 04:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
wasn't presented maybe to the Edna
 
04:33:01.620 --> 04:33:02.570 align:start position:0%
wasn't presented maybe to the Edna
committee

04:33:02.570 --> 04:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:33:05.209 --> 04:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
in a bill last year because obviously
 
04:33:07.070 --> 04:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
these things didn't happen overnight
 
04:33:09.289 --> 04:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
somebody's been thinking about this
 
04:33:11.750 --> 04:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
well to be clear this is an oplc's bill
 
04:33:14.390 --> 04:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
but uh this is a bill in House Bill 2
 
04:33:16.131 --> 04:33:16.141 align:start position:0%
that proposes significant structural
 
04:33:18.650 --> 04:33:18.660 align:start position:0%
changes within an agency and we've seen
 
04:33:19.970 --> 04:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
that time and time and again in House
 
04:33:22.670 --> 04:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 in fact in 2015 and that Budget
 
04:33:25.310 --> 04:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
Trailer that's how oplc was created so
 
04:33:28.010 --> 04:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
it is pretty commonplace for the
 
04:33:30.170 --> 04:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
governor to propose major structural
 
04:33:32.449 --> 04:33:32.459 align:start position:0%
changes within an executive branch
 
04:33:34.369 --> 04:33:34.379 align:start position:0%
agency last year I think it was
 
04:33:36.429 --> 04:33:36.439 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
04:33:40.490 --> 04:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
obviously I referenced hoplc
 
04:33:43.070 --> 04:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
um you know so I think you know I can't
 
04:33:45.590 --> 04:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
speak to you know the governor's
 
04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
decision and any respect but that this
 
04:33:50.929 --> 04:33:50.939 align:start position:0%
is how the process works when there are
 
04:33:52.670 --> 04:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
proposals within House Bill 2 it goes to
 
04:33:52.680 --> 04:33:54.349 align:start position:0%
proposals within House Bill 2 it goes to
finance

04:33:54.349 --> 04:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
finance
 
04:33:56.269 --> 04:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
and I think it's pretty consistent with
 
04:33:57.709 --> 04:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
what we've seen in the past regarding
 
04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
structural changes for agencies and and
 
04:34:02.209 --> 04:34:02.219 align:start position:0%
that is true we actually saw the split
 
04:34:04.010 --> 04:34:04.020 align:start position:0%
up of dread several years ago but it
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
wasn't quite as extensive at this and it
 
04:34:09.590 --> 04:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't a huge policy shift that affected
 
04:34:12.170 --> 04:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
perhaps tens of thousands of people at
 
04:34:14.029 --> 04:34:14.039 align:start position:0%
once that's that's what I was getting to
 
04:34:16.131 --> 04:34:16.141 align:start position:0%
because obviously again not to debate
 
04:34:17.631 --> 04:34:17.641 align:start position:0%
you about this but
 
04:34:20.810 --> 04:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
it appears to me that you must have had
 
04:34:24.470 --> 04:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
some input to the governor's requests
 
04:34:26.269 --> 04:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
because these are all affecting your
 
04:34:29.150 --> 04:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
agency it certainly we're consulted as I
 
04:34:31.369 --> 04:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
believe most agencies are when there are
 
04:34:33.650 --> 04:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
anticipated to be major structural
 
04:34:35.029 --> 04:34:35.039 align:start position:0%
changes but I think we're putting the
 
04:34:37.189 --> 04:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
car before the horse here because what I
 
04:34:38.449 --> 04:34:38.459 align:start position:0%
think would make sense and I don't want
 
04:34:40.010 --> 04:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
to disagree with you
 
04:34:41.570 --> 04:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
um representative there are significant
 
04:34:43.369 --> 04:34:43.379 align:start position:0%
structural changes that are proposed but
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
we haven't had an overall overview of
 
04:34:47.449 --> 04:34:47.459 align:start position:0%
what those changes are and rather than
 
04:34:49.310 --> 04:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
pick and choose which portions that we'd
 
04:34:50.990 --> 04:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
like to discuss it may make sense for me
 
04:34:52.609 --> 04:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
to go through House Bill 2 and actually
 
04:34:54.709 --> 04:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
explain what is within the bill and and
 
04:34:55.789 --> 04:34:55.799 align:start position:0%
to the extent that you have questions
 
04:34:57.830 --> 04:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer those yeah if you
 
04:34:59.209 --> 04:34:59.219 align:start position:0%
have a handout that would be great I
 
04:35:08.590 --> 04:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:16.070 --> 04:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:17.810 --> 04:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
well um
 
04:35:21.230 --> 04:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman is handing out this uh he had
 
04:35:25.369 --> 04:35:25.379 align:start position:0%
a representative Schmidt from Dover I
 
04:35:27.410 --> 04:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
believe would like to ask a question or
 
04:35:33.230 --> 04:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:35.990 --> 04:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
you want to take my seat please today
 
04:35:41.650 --> 04:35:41.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:44.090 --> 04:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record
 
04:35:47.029 --> 04:35:47.039 align:start position:0%
representative Peter Schmidt represent
 
04:35:50.869 --> 04:35:50.879 align:start position:0%
Dover Ward one and I've been on the Edna
 
04:35:54.470 --> 04:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
committee now this is my 17th year 20th
 
04:35:56.990 --> 04:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
year in the house
 
04:36:00.529 --> 04:36:00.539 align:start position:0%
um and uh I'm really pleased to have the
 
04:36:02.109 --> 04:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work with you because
 
04:36:03.890 --> 04:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
several members of the committee
 
04:36:06.170 --> 04:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
yourself included have asked some very
 
04:36:08.330 --> 04:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
penetrating questions which I very much
 
04:36:11.150 --> 04:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
agree with and I'd like to address but
 
04:36:14.631 --> 04:36:14.641 align:start position:0%
I'd like to begin by saying that uh the
 
04:36:17.090 --> 04:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
director Courtney and I have worked
 
04:36:19.429 --> 04:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
together since she has taken over as the
 
04:36:21.230 --> 04:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
executive director and I'm very
 
04:36:24.769 --> 04:36:24.779 align:start position:0%
supportive of the the efforts that she's
 
04:36:30.289 --> 04:36:30.299 align:start position:0%
engaged in to try to shape oplc into a
 
04:36:32.330 --> 04:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
much more functional organization which
 
04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
I think it has not been since its
 
04:36:38.990 --> 04:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
Inception uh for reasons I won't get
 
04:36:41.869 --> 04:36:41.879 align:start position:0%
into but but the thing is that her skill
 
04:36:44.269 --> 04:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
as a trained lawyer but also has
 
04:36:46.970 --> 04:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
management background has been very
 
04:36:50.029 --> 04:36:50.039 align:start position:0%
felicitous in terms of getting at some
 
04:36:51.849 --> 04:36:51.859 align:start position:0%
of these problems which
 
04:36:55.910 --> 04:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
have a long it took a long time to put
 
04:36:59.529 --> 04:36:59.539 align:start position:0%
all this stuff together and unwinding it
 
04:37:02.929 --> 04:37:02.939 align:start position:0%
in a very very short period of time
 
04:37:06.289 --> 04:37:06.299 align:start position:0%
too little time in my judgment is is
 
04:37:07.810 --> 04:37:07.820 align:start position:0%
very risky
 
04:37:10.670 --> 04:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
that in many of the steps that director
 
04:37:14.051 --> 04:37:14.061 align:start position:0%
Courtney has initiated I think
 
04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
show promise to to bring about a better
 
04:37:20.150 --> 04:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
situation because even though it hasn't
 
04:37:21.650 --> 04:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
been referenced very much in this
 
04:37:24.470 --> 04:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
hearing one of the problems with with
 
04:37:26.750 --> 04:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
some of the smaller boards especially is
 
04:37:29.570 --> 04:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
the problem of getting a quorum together
 
04:37:32.830 --> 04:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
and many of these boards do not meet
 
04:37:35.869 --> 04:37:35.879 align:start position:0%
monthly some of the smaller ones only
 
04:37:39.709 --> 04:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
meet every couple of months so a lot of
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
the processed things that that oplc can
 
04:37:46.730 --> 04:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
do on a on a very quick basis because
 
04:37:48.769 --> 04:37:48.779 align:start position:0%
they're there
 
04:37:50.689 --> 04:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
five days a week
 
04:37:52.551 --> 04:37:52.561 align:start position:0%
they have people who are trained
 
04:37:55.750 --> 04:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys trained administrators
 
04:37:58.849 --> 04:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
and the other things that go into a
 
04:38:02.090 --> 04:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
competent administrative structure
 
04:38:04.929 --> 04:38:04.939 align:start position:0%
um and they should be doing those things
 
04:38:07.250 --> 04:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
and they are doing those things ever
 
04:38:09.650 --> 04:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
more and they've been working together
 
04:38:12.051 --> 04:38:12.061 align:start position:0%
with Edna and the leadership both on the
 
04:38:14.330 --> 04:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
Democratic and Republican side in Edna
 
04:38:17.330 --> 04:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
has been watching this situation with
 
04:38:20.209 --> 04:38:20.219 align:start position:0%
growing concern because we have been and
 
04:38:21.650 --> 04:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
those of you who've been here for a
 
04:38:23.150 --> 04:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
while has seen and the director will
 
04:38:25.070 --> 04:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
affirm this
 
04:38:29.170 --> 04:38:29.180 align:start position:0%
um that in many cases the um
 
04:38:31.310 --> 04:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
04:38:35.869 --> 04:38:35.879 align:start position:0%
the statute uh needs amending
 
04:38:37.849 --> 04:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
so there's something she just can't do
 
04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
on her own for all the planning that's
 
04:38:43.250 --> 04:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
involved she can't actually do some of
 
04:38:45.830 --> 04:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
the things without working with us and
 
04:38:48.529 --> 04:38:48.539 align:start position:0%
we have been amending the statutes for
 
04:38:49.849 --> 04:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
some time now
 
04:38:53.570 --> 04:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
taking out commissioner or board or
 
04:38:55.490 --> 04:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
whatever and put in an executive
 
04:38:55.500 --> 04:38:57.429 align:start position:0%
whatever and put in an executive
director

04:38:57.429 --> 04:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
director
 
04:38:59.709 --> 04:38:59.719 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:39:03.051 --> 04:39:03.061 align:start position:0%
fortuitous in some respects but it's
 
04:39:06.051 --> 04:39:06.061 align:start position:0%
also risky right it's kind of like when
 
04:39:08.510 --> 04:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
you're on that tightrope
 
04:39:10.070 --> 04:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
when you're pressing down on the Rope
 
04:39:13.310 --> 04:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
you're safe You Wobble and you're down
 
04:39:16.010 --> 04:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
on the ground maybe a long way down on
 
04:39:19.131 --> 04:39:19.141 align:start position:0%
the ground so the thing is that we
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
started a couple years ago with some of
 
04:39:24.410 --> 04:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
the very very small boys like Midwifery
 
04:39:26.750 --> 04:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
which was referenced earlier right
 
04:39:28.369 --> 04:39:28.379 align:start position:0%
because they were having a hard time
 
04:39:31.490 --> 04:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
with quorum and then the whole thing
 
04:39:35.090 --> 04:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
gets squishy so we had a thing which a
 
04:39:37.610 --> 04:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
bill that was going to put the executive
 
04:39:39.410 --> 04:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
director into Authority and make the
 
04:39:41.150 --> 04:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
board advisory
 
04:39:44.270 --> 04:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
but this concept is not well understood
 
04:39:47.750 --> 04:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
and it's very scary to these boards they
 
04:39:49.090 --> 04:39:49.100 align:start position:0%
think that they're going to get
 
04:39:52.190 --> 04:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
de-licensed and deregulated and they're
 
04:39:54.830 --> 04:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
going to get done away with that's not
 
04:39:57.170 --> 04:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
my purpose I can tell you when it's not
 
04:39:59.930 --> 04:39:59.940 align:start position:0%
edina's purpose and I deeply believe
 
04:40:01.550 --> 04:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
that it's not director Courtney's
 
04:40:03.890 --> 04:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
purpose either it's to try to create a
 
04:40:05.990 --> 04:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
structure that works better than what we
 
04:40:09.230 --> 04:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
have now at least for smaller boards for
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
sure the bigger boards I think are in a
 
04:40:13.368 --> 04:40:13.378 align:start position:0%
much better situation generally
 
04:40:16.130 --> 04:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
so the thing is that
 
04:40:19.368 --> 04:40:19.378 align:start position:0%
with regard to House Bill 2 and some of
 
04:40:21.230 --> 04:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
the questions that you asked earlier as
 
04:40:23.630 --> 04:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
I said were very perceptive and I'd like
 
04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
to try to answer some of them so the
 
04:40:27.830 --> 04:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
thing is that
 
04:40:31.090 --> 04:40:31.100 align:start position:0%
there there's some good ideas in
 
04:40:34.970 --> 04:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
I've been using the
 
04:40:37.730 --> 04:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
press release That You released back on
 
04:40:40.130 --> 04:40:40.140 align:start position:0%
the 22nd of February I think as kind of
 
04:40:43.490 --> 04:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
a working diagram right some of the
 
04:40:45.770 --> 04:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
principles in unseated on page one I
 
04:40:48.050 --> 04:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
very much agree with but when it comes
 
04:40:50.510 --> 04:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
to instituting them in the repeal or
 
04:40:52.730 --> 04:40:52.740 align:start position:0%
merging a boards or repealing of
 
04:40:55.190 --> 04:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
professions and occupations then it's
 
04:40:57.310 --> 04:40:57.320 align:start position:0%
kind of surgery with a MedEx
 
04:40:59.510 --> 04:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
some of these professions and
 
04:41:02.830 --> 04:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
occupations absolutely do not
 
04:41:05.150 --> 04:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
deserve to be repealed we've already
 
04:41:07.850 --> 04:41:07.860 align:start position:0%
mentioned soil scientists Foresters and
 
04:41:10.250 --> 04:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
so forth and I think that they have
 
04:41:12.050 --> 04:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
already been kind of pulled out
 
04:41:14.990 --> 04:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
but let's take court reporters
 
04:41:17.270 --> 04:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
people think well they're not in the
 
04:41:19.250 --> 04:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
courts anymore it's a dying profession
 
04:41:22.190 --> 04:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
it's not a dying profession it's still a
 
04:41:24.288 --> 04:41:24.298 align:start position:0%
very Dynamic profession that's very much
 
04:41:27.050 --> 04:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
used in depositions and I know some of
 
04:41:28.730 --> 04:41:28.740 align:start position:0%
these court reporters and they say
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
they're still making a very good living
 
04:41:32.510 --> 04:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
and they're very important they're by
 
04:41:34.310 --> 04:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
virtue of their license they're able to
 
04:41:36.830 --> 04:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
swear people in
 
04:41:40.128 --> 04:41:40.138 align:start position:0%
they're able to act as notaries and they
 
04:41:41.810 --> 04:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
also have the skill and of course those
 
04:41:43.850 --> 04:41:43.860 align:start position:0%
of us who serve on gel car and the
 
04:41:46.010 --> 04:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
director's there on a regular basis we
 
04:41:47.628 --> 04:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
have a court reporter
 
04:41:51.708 --> 04:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
because we need a viable vital accurate
 
04:41:51.718 --> 04:41:52.610 align:start position:0%
because we need a viable vital accurate
record

04:41:52.610 --> 04:41:52.620 align:start position:0%
record
 
04:41:55.490 --> 04:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
can't get that with a tape recorder when
 
04:41:58.070 --> 04:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
somebody coughs or slams a door or
 
04:41:59.628 --> 04:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
something like that and the transcript
 
04:42:01.850 --> 04:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
comes back when it's a tape recorder
 
04:42:03.830 --> 04:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
that transcripts some comes back and it
 
04:42:03.840 --> 04:42:05.288 align:start position:0%
that transcripts some comes back and it
says

04:42:05.288 --> 04:42:05.298 align:start position:0%
says
 
04:42:05.298 --> 04:42:07.150 align:start position:0%
says
inaudible

04:42:07.150 --> 04:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
inaudible
 
04:42:10.070 --> 04:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
inaudible the court reporter when that
 
04:42:12.830 --> 04:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
happens they say judge
 
04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
I didn't get that can we have that
 
04:42:17.570 --> 04:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
remark or that statement repeated so now
 
04:42:19.128 --> 04:42:19.138 align:start position:0%
you get a transcript that's worth
 
04:42:21.948 --> 04:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
something it's a viable record so court
 
04:42:23.868 --> 04:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
reporters are still very important even
 
04:42:25.368 --> 04:42:25.378 align:start position:0%
though there are not very many of them
 
04:42:25.378 --> 04:42:26.690 align:start position:0%
though there are not very many of them
left

04:42:26.690 --> 04:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
left
 
04:42:29.390 --> 04:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
but you know there's only one Wizard of
 
04:42:33.288 --> 04:42:33.298 align:start position:0%
Oz too I mean it depends on there's only
 
04:42:36.170 --> 04:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
there was only one Vladimir Horowitz too
 
04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
but he did play the piano pretty well so
 
04:42:40.090 --> 04:42:40.100 align:start position:0%
the thing is
 
04:42:42.650 --> 04:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
this took a long time to put together
 
04:42:44.868 --> 04:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
and every one of these licensed
 
04:42:46.850 --> 04:42:46.860 align:start position:0%
professions was the result of a
 
04:42:49.128 --> 04:42:49.138 align:start position:0%
conscious individual decision on the
 
04:42:51.170 --> 04:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
part of the legislature sometimes a
 
04:42:53.330 --> 04:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
hundred years ago
 
04:42:55.850 --> 04:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
and to unwind all of that in the time
 
04:42:57.708 --> 04:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
that you have and we had
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
in my judgment is completely premature
 
04:43:01.788 --> 04:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
and unworkable
 
04:43:04.310 --> 04:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
for all the idea that it's there's some
 
04:43:05.930 --> 04:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
of these some nuggets of good
 
04:43:08.150 --> 04:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
information and perhaps some of these
 
04:43:09.770 --> 04:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
boards can be put together in a
 
04:43:11.690 --> 04:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
different way and the director's working
 
04:43:13.670 --> 04:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
on this and we're working on it whether
 
04:43:15.590 --> 04:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
an Edna
 
04:43:19.310 --> 04:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
so I think your question earlier about
 
04:43:22.250 --> 04:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
um why wasn't this started some time ago
 
04:43:24.470 --> 04:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
I can't answer that question and I wish
 
04:43:26.750 --> 04:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
it had been because that's what we
 
04:43:29.510 --> 04:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
stopped one of the Omnibus bills a
 
04:43:31.368 --> 04:43:31.378 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago because it was going
 
04:43:33.050 --> 04:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
to give the executive director's
 
04:43:33.060 --> 04:43:35.170 align:start position:0%
to give the executive director's
position

04:43:35.170 --> 04:43:35.180 align:start position:0%
position
 
04:43:38.810 --> 04:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
a lot more Authority and we said we
 
04:43:40.550 --> 04:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
don't want that until we can see how
 
04:43:42.770 --> 04:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
that's going to be exercised because
 
04:43:45.410 --> 04:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a complete handle on how
 
04:43:47.150 --> 04:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
that was going to be done and it very
 
04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
much depends on having a good executive
 
04:43:53.208 --> 04:43:53.218 align:start position:0%
director but also a concept that really
 
04:43:55.330 --> 04:43:55.340 align:start position:0%
works and I think the idea of having the
 
04:43:58.670 --> 04:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
administrative side in its entirety
 
04:44:00.530 --> 04:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
be in the hands of
 
04:44:03.770 --> 04:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
opoc but the substance of the
 
04:44:05.570 --> 04:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
professions and the occupations and
 
04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
their governance to be done by the
 
04:44:09.948 --> 04:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
people who are the practitioners of that
 
04:44:12.770 --> 04:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
profession and that that occupation
 
04:44:15.650 --> 04:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
and it takes just like it takes two legs
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
to walk or run
 
04:44:19.430 --> 04:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
maybe you got one real good leg but if
 
04:44:21.230 --> 04:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
you've got one real bad leg
 
04:44:22.970 --> 04:44:22.980 align:start position:0%
maybe you can hop like heck but you
 
04:44:24.288 --> 04:44:24.298 align:start position:0%
can't run or walk
 
04:44:27.050 --> 04:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
and so it takes that teamwork between
 
04:44:30.050 --> 04:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
director Courtney and her increasingly
 
04:44:32.628 --> 04:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
competent and experienced staff but it
 
04:44:34.490 --> 04:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
also takes the expertise of the board
 
04:44:36.590 --> 04:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
members and the public members they
 
04:44:38.330 --> 04:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be dismissed
 
04:44:40.910 --> 04:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
to handle the
 
04:44:43.730 --> 04:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
the real mechanics the inner workings of
 
04:44:47.708 --> 04:44:47.718 align:start position:0%
the professions be it medicine law or
 
04:44:51.530 --> 04:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
forestry for that matter so I think I
 
04:44:54.410 --> 04:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
think we are we are need DNA we're
 
04:44:55.788 --> 04:44:55.798 align:start position:0%
deeply committed
 
04:44:59.208 --> 04:44:59.218 align:start position:0%
to uh to doing this in conjunction with
 
04:45:01.070 --> 04:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
the efforts of the executive director
 
04:45:04.070 --> 04:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
here but I think and it's it's in its
 
04:45:07.190 --> 04:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
totality that this concept of putting
 
04:45:09.830 --> 04:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
this in the trailer bill is premature
 
04:45:11.868 --> 04:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
and unworkable
 
04:45:13.788 --> 04:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
so I'll be happy to answer any questions
 
04:45:16.490 --> 04:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
you may have thank you representative
 
04:45:18.410 --> 04:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
04:45:18.420 --> 04:45:19.788 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
Representatives

04:45:19.788 --> 04:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
04:45:21.830 --> 04:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
yeah this is the thank you Mr chairman
 
04:45:23.868 --> 04:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
this is the first time I've sat on this
 
04:45:25.550 --> 04:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
side of the table at the inside of the
 
04:45:28.190 --> 04:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
other side that's true versus vice versa
 
04:45:28.200 --> 04:45:29.690 align:start position:0%
other side that's true versus vice versa
so

04:45:29.690 --> 04:45:29.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:45:31.550 --> 04:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
um let's talk about court reporters in
 
04:45:34.810 --> 04:45:34.820 align:start position:0%
particular okay right sure so
 
04:45:39.070 --> 04:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
being licensed means that
 
04:45:42.530 --> 04:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
someone is not allowed to do that work
 
04:45:46.490 --> 04:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
correct unless they have the license
 
04:45:49.010 --> 04:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
right well they can't legally do it the
 
04:45:53.208 --> 04:45:53.218 align:start position:0%
light the advantage legally yeah well I
 
04:45:54.830 --> 04:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
won't let you finish your question after
 
04:45:56.930 --> 04:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
I give you a little tip so there's
 
04:45:58.788 --> 04:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
really no difference in terms of the
 
04:46:01.310 --> 04:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
level of competence between a licensed
 
04:46:04.010 --> 04:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
person and a certified person in some
 
04:46:05.930 --> 04:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
case even a registered person like a
 
04:46:08.930 --> 04:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
registered nurse the license says you
 
04:46:11.030 --> 04:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
can legally do it in this state and you
 
04:46:13.788 --> 04:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
can't do it legally without the license
 
04:46:16.190 --> 04:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
and the license can the advantage of the
 
04:46:18.350 --> 04:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
licenses it could be suspended or
 
04:46:20.930 --> 04:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
revoked for misconduct incompetence and
 
04:46:22.070 --> 04:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
04:46:24.530 --> 04:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
right but in particular court reporters
 
04:46:24.540 --> 04:46:26.448 align:start position:0%
right but in particular court reporters
so

04:46:26.448 --> 04:46:26.458 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:30.530 --> 04:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
the person hiring a court reporter is an
 
04:46:33.470 --> 04:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
attorney right a very experienced you
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
know or a judge right very very
 
04:46:38.690 --> 04:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
experienced person so
 
04:46:42.230 --> 04:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
aren't they competent to judge who they
 
04:46:44.690 --> 04:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
want to hire on their own why do they
 
04:46:48.470 --> 04:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
need us as a state to say this person is
 
04:46:50.390 --> 04:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
hirable for that job and this person
 
04:46:50.400 --> 04:46:52.128 align:start position:0%
hirable for that job and this person
isn't

04:46:52.128 --> 04:46:52.138 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
04:46:55.310 --> 04:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
as opposed to let them make the decision
 
04:46:58.310 --> 04:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
just like I make a decision when I hire
 
04:47:00.890 --> 04:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
somebody to fix my car or do all kinds
 
04:47:03.410 --> 04:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
of other things that are unlicensed
 
04:47:06.170 --> 04:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
well and that's an interesting
 
04:47:08.930 --> 04:47:08.940 align:start position:0%
philosophical discussion to have the
 
04:47:11.330 --> 04:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
thing is if you know
 
04:47:13.850 --> 04:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
who that person is and you've dealt with
 
04:47:15.590 --> 04:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
him or her before
 
04:47:17.510 --> 04:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
and you ha and you have trust in that
 
04:47:17.520 --> 04:47:18.470 align:start position:0%
and you ha and you have trust in that
person

04:47:18.470 --> 04:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:47:20.510 --> 04:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
then you're going to go back to them if
 
04:47:22.750 --> 04:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
they're not over charging or whatever
 
04:47:25.610 --> 04:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
but how about if the person has a
 
04:47:29.650 --> 04:47:29.660 align:start position:0%
problem with substance abuse or uh is is
 
04:47:32.030 --> 04:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
very competent but they're kind of
 
04:47:33.530 --> 04:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
dishonest in terms of what they're
 
04:47:35.930 --> 04:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
charging you for and so forth now that's
 
04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
a situation where you might want to
 
04:47:40.910 --> 04:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
bring that person in
 
04:47:43.250 --> 04:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
because they're doing something that's
 
04:47:46.430 --> 04:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
illegal so that's that's one of the
 
04:47:48.590 --> 04:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
things about a license that you can take
 
04:47:50.930 --> 04:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
it away from a person if they're not
 
04:47:52.788 --> 04:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
meeting the totality of their
 
04:47:55.730 --> 04:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
responsibilities not merely to to fix
 
04:48:00.250 --> 04:48:00.260 align:start position:0%
your car engine or fix your ticker
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
but also to be honest and maybe not
 
04:48:06.708 --> 04:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
engage in misuse of substances or
 
04:48:09.190 --> 04:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
something like that so
 
04:48:11.930 --> 04:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further questions
 
04:48:13.670 --> 04:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
for the representative I appreciate the
 
04:48:15.948 --> 04:48:15.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity I really appreciate your
 
04:48:18.708 --> 04:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
comments good to see you keep up the
 
04:48:21.670 --> 04:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
good work good to see you
 
04:48:25.128 --> 04:48:25.138 align:start position:0%
thanks again we can move to your handout
 
04:48:25.138 --> 04:48:26.868 align:start position:0%
thanks again we can move to your handout
perfect

04:48:26.868 --> 04:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
04:48:28.310 --> 04:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
um and again for the record Lindsay
 
04:48:29.868 --> 04:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
Courtney I'm the executive director of
 
04:48:31.190 --> 04:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
The Office of professional ice Insurance
 
04:48:31.200 --> 04:48:32.448 align:start position:0%
The Office of professional ice Insurance
certification

04:48:32.448 --> 04:48:32.458 align:start position:0%
certification
 
04:48:35.330 --> 04:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the opportunity what I
 
04:48:36.470 --> 04:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
just wanted to do is go through
 
04:48:39.230 --> 04:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
factually what I have observed
 
04:48:42.770 --> 04:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
um HB to uh proposing to do we've spent
 
04:48:44.030 --> 04:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of time going through the language
 
04:48:45.350 --> 04:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
here in the office looking at
 
04:48:46.788 --> 04:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
legislative history and I thought it
 
04:48:50.990 --> 04:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
might be useful to the to the division
 
04:48:53.990 --> 04:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
um so on page two uh here's an overview
 
04:48:56.868 --> 04:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much uh what we included in
 
04:48:59.090 --> 04:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
our press release but um I always filled
 
04:49:01.250 --> 04:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
two proposes to establish Universal
 
04:49:04.070 --> 04:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
licensure recognition this was also
 
04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly supported by the house I
 
04:49:08.470 --> 04:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
think that was House Bill 594
 
04:49:11.448 --> 04:49:11.458 align:start position:0%
that also proposes to allow the office
 
04:49:14.150 --> 04:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
to issue licenses to individuals from
 
04:49:17.090 --> 04:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
out of states it proposes to transfer
 
04:49:19.368 --> 04:49:19.378 align:start position:0%
certain boards to the office merge and
 
04:49:22.970 --> 04:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
reduce certain board sizes eliminate
 
04:49:24.470 --> 04:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
certain license types eliminate certain
 
04:49:26.330 --> 04:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
boards and then add one additional
 
04:49:28.250 --> 04:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
license type
 
04:49:30.110 --> 04:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of universal licensure
 
04:49:33.650 --> 04:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
recognition we've already had an
 
04:49:33.660 --> 04:49:34.750 align:start position:0%
recognition we've already had an
experiment

04:49:34.750 --> 04:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
experiment
 
04:49:37.330 --> 04:49:37.340 align:start position:0%
in this state regarding
 
04:49:39.590 --> 04:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
Universal licensure recognition and that
 
04:49:42.708 --> 04:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
was during covid-19 and during covid-19
 
04:49:44.390 --> 04:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
State of Emergency the governor
 
04:49:46.490 --> 04:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
authorized the office to issue emergency
 
04:49:49.010 --> 04:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
licenses and the criteria was limited to
 
04:49:50.810 --> 04:49:50.820 align:start position:0%
one they had to have a similar license
 
04:49:52.310 --> 04:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
at another state they had to be in good
 
04:49:54.708 --> 04:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
standing and we were able to increase
 
04:49:56.448 --> 04:49:56.458 align:start position:0%
the number of licensed Health Care
 
04:49:59.270 --> 04:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
Professionals 22
 
04:50:02.570 --> 04:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
000 and we had we received fewer than 10
 
04:50:04.010 --> 04:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
complaints and we've only had one
 
04:50:06.230 --> 04:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
reported disciplinary action and I think
 
04:50:07.610 --> 04:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
that was real data that helped
 
04:50:10.730 --> 04:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that the public would not be
 
04:50:13.850 --> 04:50:13.860 align:start position:0%
at significant Risk by allowing us to
 
04:50:15.590 --> 04:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
issue these licenses if they've been
 
04:50:18.530 --> 04:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
vetted in other states and we are able
 
04:50:20.570 --> 04:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
to issue them in about 24 hours and so
 
04:50:22.010 --> 04:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
that makes us a little much more
 
04:50:23.628 --> 04:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
competitive with our sister States like
 
04:50:25.970 --> 04:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
Vermont who's already doing this and so
 
04:50:28.010 --> 04:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
the house bill 2 proposes to codify this
 
04:50:30.110 --> 04:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
process success and allow us to issue
 
04:50:32.868 --> 04:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
emergency permanent licenses based on
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
the same criteria so what I've included
 
04:50:37.788 --> 04:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
in the subsequent Pages looks like
 
04:50:41.390 --> 04:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
through Page seven are really just some
 
04:50:44.390 --> 04:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
charts of the data that we saw during
 
04:50:46.448 --> 04:50:46.458 align:start position:0%
the emergency licensure
 
04:50:49.190 --> 04:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
experiment and I really wanted to draw
 
04:50:50.990 --> 04:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
your attention to the mental health
 
04:50:53.750 --> 04:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
Fields because we we saw a significant
 
04:50:55.610 --> 04:50:55.620 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of licensed
 
04:50:57.530 --> 04:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
professionals when we modified the
 
04:51:00.890 --> 04:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
criteria to be just that you had a
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
license in another state that was in
 
04:51:05.150 --> 04:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
good standing in particular during the
 
04:51:09.010 --> 04:51:09.020 align:start position:0%
state of emergency 36 percent of latex
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
were like were licensed here only on an
 
04:51:15.708 --> 04:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
emergency license 45 almost half of
 
04:51:17.330 --> 04:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
clinical Mental Health Counselors were
 
04:51:19.570 --> 04:51:19.580 align:start position:0%
practicing only on an emergency license
 
04:51:23.930 --> 04:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh 44 again almost half of individuals
 
04:51:26.270 --> 04:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
licensed in New Hampshire to practice
 
04:51:28.670 --> 04:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
clinical social work we're doing so on
 
04:51:31.970 --> 04:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
an emergency license and then with
 
04:51:35.570 --> 04:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
respect to psychologists 63 percent of
 
04:51:37.070 --> 04:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
individuals who are authorized to
 
04:51:39.170 --> 04:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
practice here we're doing so on an
 
04:51:41.690 --> 04:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
emergency license and so certainly the
 
04:51:44.208 --> 04:51:44.218 align:start position:0%
structural change that's proposed this
 
04:51:45.530 --> 04:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
portion of the structural change that's
 
04:51:48.050 --> 04:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
proposed in House Bill 2 is a
 
04:51:49.788 --> 04:51:49.798 align:start position:0%
significant change but it's a change
 
04:51:51.350 --> 04:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
that's already being accepted in New
 
04:51:53.448 --> 04:51:53.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and certainly accepted by the
 
04:51:56.810 --> 04:51:56.820 align:start position:0%
house and so I don't think is that
 
04:51:59.690 --> 04:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
controversial at least not now we did
 
04:52:03.470 --> 04:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
attempt to request this bill last year
 
04:52:06.470 --> 04:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
and it didn't make its way out of
 
04:52:06.480 --> 04:52:08.930 align:start position:0%
and it didn't make its way out of
committee

04:52:08.930 --> 04:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:10.670 --> 04:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
page eight
 
04:52:13.910 --> 04:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
yes represent Maguire please on page six
 
04:52:13.920 --> 04:52:15.530 align:start position:0%
yes represent Maguire please on page six
physician

04:52:15.530 --> 04:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
physician
 
04:52:18.590 --> 04:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
65 percent what does that mean
 
04:52:22.970 --> 04:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
so that data that data references that
 
04:52:25.310 --> 04:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
65 percent of individuals licensed
 
04:52:27.350 --> 04:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
practice medicine during the state of
 
04:52:29.270 --> 04:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
emergency were doing so only on an
 
04:52:31.610 --> 04:52:31.620 align:start position:0%
emergency license the reason why I don't
 
04:52:33.590 --> 04:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
think that with respect to Physicians
 
04:52:35.930 --> 04:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
and Physicians only that data actually
 
04:52:37.850 --> 04:52:37.860 align:start position:0%
accurately captures what we're looking
 
04:52:40.670 --> 04:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
at is because we worked with the
 
04:52:41.930 --> 04:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:52:44.208 --> 04:52:44.218 align:start position:0%
to license all of their Medicaid
 
04:52:46.788 --> 04:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
enrolled Physicians who were in
 
04:52:49.190 --> 04:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so that our New Hampshire
 
04:52:51.170 --> 04:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
constituents could continue to receive
 
04:52:52.850 --> 04:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
services from massachusetts-based
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
Physicians and that's why that number is
 
04:52:56.690 --> 04:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
a little bit higher than what we would
 
04:53:00.830 --> 04:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:03.170 --> 04:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
represent a people so
 
04:53:06.890 --> 04:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
versal licensure recognition
 
04:53:09.708 --> 04:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
24 hours do you just sort of
 
04:53:11.930 --> 04:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
compare the licensing requirements in
 
04:53:13.430 --> 04:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to those of the other
 
04:53:16.490 --> 04:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
state just to see how they mesh
 
04:53:18.708 --> 04:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
or or how does that work yeah so the
 
04:53:21.170 --> 04:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
license has to be of a similar nature so
 
04:53:22.788 --> 04:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
for example
 
04:53:22.798 --> 04:53:23.570 align:start position:0%
for example
um

04:53:23.570 --> 04:53:23.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:25.550 --> 04:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
naturopathic doctors we typically don't
 
04:53:27.470 --> 04:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
itchy those types of licenses because
 
04:53:31.310 --> 04:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
the licensing requirements are so so
 
04:53:33.948 --> 04:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
different and they vary significantly in
 
04:53:36.128 --> 04:53:36.138 align:start position:0%
the scope of practice in our state is
 
04:53:39.590 --> 04:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
significantly different allow they're
 
04:53:42.050 --> 04:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
allowed they have a formulary so we do
 
04:53:44.030 --> 04:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
have to conduct that analysis but for
 
04:53:47.030 --> 04:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
most Healthcare professions you know
 
04:53:50.050 --> 04:53:50.060 align:start position:0%
nursing Physicians it's pretty standard
 
04:53:50.060 --> 04:53:51.730 align:start position:0%
nursing Physicians it's pretty standard
across

04:53:51.730 --> 04:53:51.740 align:start position:0%
across
 
04:53:54.010 --> 04:53:54.020 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
04:53:57.410 --> 04:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
and you know there from a policy
 
04:53:59.868 --> 04:53:59.878 align:start position:0%
standpoint when we talk about this in
 
04:54:01.910 --> 04:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
cosmetology we have 1500 hours
 
04:54:03.830 --> 04:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
requirements well if they're coming from
 
04:54:05.330 --> 04:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
a state that has a thousand hours but
 
04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
they work for 10 years
 
04:54:10.490 --> 04:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
it should be sufficient for the most
 
04:54:10.500 --> 04:54:11.390 align:start position:0%
it should be sufficient for the most
part

04:54:11.390 --> 04:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
part
 
04:54:15.050 --> 04:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
um so we do engage in that analysis but
 
04:54:17.390 --> 04:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
um we are able to issue them in a fast
 
04:54:21.550 --> 04:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:24.230 --> 04:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the board transfers on
 
04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
page 8 how spill two proposes to
 
04:54:28.788 --> 04:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
transfer auctioneers from the Secretary
 
04:54:30.770 --> 04:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
of State's office their boxing and
 
04:54:32.090 --> 04:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
wrestling commission from the Secretary
 
04:54:33.590 --> 04:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
of State's office
 
04:54:35.930 --> 04:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
bondsman from Secretary of States and
 
04:54:37.250 --> 04:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
then the board of Licensing for
 
04:54:38.930 --> 04:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
interpreters for the deaf deafblind and
 
04:54:41.390 --> 04:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
hard of hearing that's from education
 
04:54:43.010 --> 04:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that the purpose
 
04:54:44.570 --> 04:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
of these transfers is really to increase
 
04:54:46.788 --> 04:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
efficiency in licensing processes and
 
04:54:48.230 --> 04:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
eliminate duplication of effort
 
04:54:48.240 --> 04:54:49.250 align:start position:0%
eliminate duplication of effort
Statewide

04:54:49.250 --> 04:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
04:54:52.550 --> 04:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
the office is is going is undergoing a
 
04:54:53.930 --> 04:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
lot of changes and has been in the last
 
04:54:55.368 --> 04:54:55.378 align:start position:0%
couple of years we are trying to
 
04:54:57.530 --> 04:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
standardize the way we do business just
 
04:54:59.090 --> 04:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
today we
 
04:55:01.250 --> 04:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
um we had a final proposal before jail
 
04:55:03.470 --> 04:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
car to have one universal licensure
 
04:55:03.480 --> 04:55:05.208 align:start position:0%
car to have one universal licensure
application

04:55:05.208 --> 04:55:05.218 align:start position:0%
application
 
04:55:08.208 --> 04:55:08.218 align:start position:0%
um initial application to include
 
04:55:10.368 --> 04:55:10.378 align:start position:0%
demographic information probably doesn't
 
04:55:13.490 --> 04:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
sound uh you know that fantastic but
 
04:55:15.110 --> 04:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's taken us years to get to a point
 
04:55:16.850 --> 04:55:16.860 align:start position:0%
where we can capture the same type of
 
04:55:19.010 --> 04:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
demographic information if you go to
 
04:55:21.650 --> 04:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
page nine we are working on several
 
04:55:26.270 --> 04:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
major strategic goals the first two are
 
04:55:28.490 --> 04:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
really leveraging technology and I think
 
04:55:30.770 --> 04:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
the idea behind putting all licensing
 
04:55:33.470 --> 04:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
boards within oplc is that we will be
 
04:55:34.510 --> 04:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
able to
 
04:55:37.128 --> 04:55:37.138 align:start position:0%
all licensing boards will be able to
 
04:55:39.530 --> 04:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
benefit from the procurement of these
 
04:55:41.570 --> 04:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
additional Technologies and we
 
04:55:43.850 --> 04:55:43.860 align:start position:0%
anticipate our new licensing portal to
 
04:55:44.990 --> 04:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
be in effect
 
04:55:49.850 --> 04:55:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:52.430 --> 04:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding with respect to the
 
04:55:53.810 --> 04:55:53.820 align:start position:0%
boards and the Secretary of State's
 
04:55:55.190 --> 04:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
office is that the secretary of state
 
04:55:57.170 --> 04:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
has no objection
 
04:56:02.510 --> 04:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm not aware of what um doe believes
 
04:56:06.110 --> 04:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:09.590 --> 04:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
on page 10 there are several proposed
 
04:56:11.390 --> 04:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
board mergers
 
04:56:14.810 --> 04:56:14.820 align:start position:0%
and as representative McGuire mentioned
 
04:56:17.930 --> 04:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
House Bill 655 as amended and passed out
 
04:56:20.708 --> 04:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
of the house I believe yesterday
 
04:56:23.868 --> 04:56:23.878 align:start position:0%
would allow oplc to issue licenses in
 
04:56:26.510 --> 04:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
between board meetings and this uh House
 
04:56:30.230 --> 04:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
Bill 655 was the result of a committee
 
04:56:31.850 --> 04:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
that was established by Senate Bill 330
 
04:56:33.350 --> 04:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
of last year and they made several
 
04:56:35.990 --> 04:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations one of which was to
 
04:56:37.910 --> 04:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
allow PLC tissue licenses in between
 
04:56:37.920 --> 04:56:39.770 align:start position:0%
allow PLC tissue licenses in between
meetings

04:56:39.770 --> 04:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:56:42.110 --> 04:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
um as you may know historically the
 
04:56:44.750 --> 04:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
practice was all applications were
 
04:56:47.090 --> 04:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
received in paper form all applications
 
04:56:49.430 --> 04:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
were brought to board meetings monthly
 
04:56:52.368 --> 04:56:52.378 align:start position:0%
or every 60 days they were reviewed and
 
04:56:53.930 --> 04:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
then decisions were made and then
 
04:56:57.350 --> 04:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
licenses were issued or denied as we've
 
04:56:57.360 --> 04:56:59.448 align:start position:0%
licenses were issued or denied as we've
seen

04:56:59.448 --> 04:56:59.458 align:start position:0%
seen
 
04:57:01.970 --> 04:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
increased demand for licensure
 
04:57:01.980 --> 04:57:03.230 align:start position:0%
increased demand for licensure
um

04:57:03.230 --> 04:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:05.690 --> 04:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
Society generally no longer supports
 
04:57:07.610 --> 04:57:07.620 align:start position:0%
this model
 
04:57:10.128 --> 04:57:10.138 align:start position:0%
from a Workforce standpoint we are
 
04:57:11.750 --> 04:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
competing with other states that are
 
04:57:13.128 --> 04:57:13.138 align:start position:0%
doing business in a different way
 
04:57:16.610 --> 04:57:16.620 align:start position:0%
particularly Vermont and they do not
 
04:57:19.910 --> 04:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
have this similar structure and addition
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
most of our boards have already
 
04:57:23.990 --> 04:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
delegated the authority to the office to
 
04:57:25.970 --> 04:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
review applications unless they're
 
04:57:28.990 --> 04:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
problematic and so
 
04:57:32.448 --> 04:57:32.458 align:start position:0%
655 and House Bill 2 would propose that
 
04:57:34.010 --> 04:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
we would issue licenses in between
 
04:57:37.128 --> 04:57:37.138 align:start position:0%
meetings unless they needed for their
 
04:57:38.390 --> 04:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
review because of a criminal history
 
04:57:41.208 --> 04:57:41.218 align:start position:0%
check or disciplinary issue and because
 
04:57:43.850 --> 04:57:43.860 align:start position:0%
boards would no longer be reviewing
 
04:57:45.230 --> 04:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
their applications at the monthly
 
04:57:47.570 --> 04:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
meetings I think I think that's the
 
04:57:50.230 --> 04:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
justification for the proposed mergers
 
04:57:54.230 --> 04:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
you no longer need each boards to sit
 
04:57:56.030 --> 04:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
around the table and divvy up at
 
04:57:58.150 --> 04:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
licensure applications
 
04:58:01.310 --> 04:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
so hb2 proposes to merge boards that are
 
04:58:03.470 --> 04:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
sufficiently similar both to increase
 
04:58:05.930 --> 04:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and promote collaboration
 
04:58:09.230 --> 04:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
between professionals we see a lot of
 
04:58:11.448 --> 04:58:11.458 align:start position:0%
scope of practice that's somewhat
 
04:58:13.190 --> 04:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
similar across several different boards
 
04:58:16.128 --> 04:58:16.138 align:start position:0%
and I think the idea is that to promote
 
04:58:16.138 --> 04:58:17.530 align:start position:0%
and I think the idea is that to promote
collaboration

04:58:17.530 --> 04:58:17.540 align:start position:0%
collaboration
 
04:58:20.090 --> 04:58:20.100 align:start position:0%
certain words are proposed to be merged
 
04:58:23.330 --> 04:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
in particular on page 11 excuse me
 
04:58:25.190 --> 04:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire has a question oh
 
04:58:26.868 --> 04:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
yeah sure so
 
04:58:29.750 --> 04:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
issuing licenses between meetings so is
 
04:58:31.670 --> 04:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
this include every kind of license
 
04:58:34.970 --> 04:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
Physicians for example yeah so we
 
04:58:36.288 --> 04:58:36.298 align:start position:0%
already do that the Board of Medicine
 
04:58:38.270 --> 04:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
has already authorized us to do that
 
04:58:44.990 --> 04:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:48.770 --> 04:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
so um so the proposed board mergers are
 
04:58:51.170 --> 04:58:51.180 align:start position:0%
The Advisory Board of reflexology with
 
04:58:53.510 --> 04:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
The Advisory Board of massage I just
 
04:58:56.110 --> 04:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to note that there are 17
 
04:58:58.430 --> 04:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
reflexologists 12 structural integrators
 
04:59:01.330 --> 04:59:01.340 align:start position:0%
and four Asian Bodywork therapists
 
04:59:03.770 --> 04:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
Nationwide these disciplines are often
 
04:59:06.470 --> 04:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
combined and I will circulate this
 
04:59:09.650 --> 04:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint along with the attachment
 
04:59:09.660 --> 04:59:11.448 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint along with the attachment
um

04:59:11.448 --> 04:59:11.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:13.550 --> 04:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
with respect to latex obviously we've
 
04:59:14.690 --> 04:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
had some conversations here in
 
04:59:16.490 --> 04:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire presented on this
 
04:59:18.288 --> 04:59:18.298 align:start position:0%
issue there are two states that
 
04:59:19.788 --> 04:59:19.798 align:start position:0%
currently combine psychology with other
 
04:59:23.750 --> 04:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
disciplines Kansas and Texas
 
04:59:25.970 --> 04:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
um I've had lengthy discussions with the
 
04:59:29.030 --> 04:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
executive director over at in Texas and
 
04:59:30.948 --> 04:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
you know I do believe if implemented
 
04:59:33.288 --> 04:59:33.298 align:start position:0%
here it it would be
 
04:59:35.390 --> 04:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
um certainly feasible it's working well
 
04:59:36.830 --> 04:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
in Texas
 
04:59:39.650 --> 04:59:39.660 align:start position:0%
the third proposal would be to merge the
 
04:59:40.788 --> 04:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine with the board of
 
04:59:41.868 --> 04:59:41.878 align:start position:0%
Podiatry and medical reviews
 
04:59:41.878 --> 04:59:43.310 align:start position:0%
Podiatry and medical reviews
subcommittee

04:59:43.310 --> 04:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
04:59:44.570 --> 04:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
with respect to the medical review
 
04:59:46.610 --> 04:59:46.620 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I wanted to note that the
 
04:59:48.770 --> 04:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine
 
04:59:48.780 --> 04:59:49.850 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine
um

04:59:49.850 --> 04:59:49.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:52.190 --> 04:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
supports removing the medical review
 
04:59:54.170 --> 04:59:54.180 align:start position:0%
subcommittee out of statute
 
04:59:56.868 --> 04:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
they want a peer review committee and we
 
04:59:58.970 --> 04:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
support that and and would recommend
 
05:00:01.970 --> 05:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
allowing them to establish that via rule
 
05:00:03.708 --> 05:00:03.718 align:start position:0%
but there are some significant issues
 
05:00:06.288 --> 05:00:06.298 align:start position:0%
with the MRC now because it's currently
 
05:00:08.990 --> 05:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
constituted it's currently in statute
 
05:00:11.208 --> 05:00:11.218 align:start position:0%
and they are governor and Council
 
05:00:13.430 --> 05:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
appointments and the problem right now
 
05:00:16.610 --> 05:00:16.620 align:start position:0%
is uh they meet half the time they
 
05:00:18.830 --> 05:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
cancel almost you know over half of
 
05:00:20.930 --> 05:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
their meetings they get through a
 
05:00:23.030 --> 05:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
handful of cases at every meeting and we
 
05:00:25.128 --> 05:00:25.138 align:start position:0%
get over 200 cases a year and so there's
 
05:00:28.128 --> 05:00:28.138 align:start position:0%
significant backlog and because the
 
05:00:29.628 --> 05:00:29.638 align:start position:0%
statute does not allow the Board of
 
05:00:31.970 --> 05:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
Medicine to provide oversight we
 
05:00:34.010 --> 05:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
essentially are stuck with people who
 
05:00:35.390 --> 05:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
are who are not
 
05:00:37.628 --> 05:00:37.638 align:start position:0%
um who are not fulfilling their duties
 
05:00:41.090 --> 05:00:41.100 align:start position:0%
and so I did want to make that comment
 
05:00:44.570 --> 05:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
with respect to the mrsc in terms of the
 
05:00:46.510 --> 05:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine and board of Podiatry
 
05:00:48.410 --> 05:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Board of Medicine
 
05:00:51.128 --> 05:00:51.138 align:start position:0%
currently regulates three disciplines
 
05:00:55.128 --> 05:00:55.138 align:start position:0%
MDS Do's or osteopaths and PAs physician
 
05:00:58.010 --> 05:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
assistants 11 states use one board to
 
05:00:59.628 --> 05:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
regulate multiple disciplines that
 
05:01:01.208 --> 05:01:01.218 align:start position:0%
include Podiatry
 
05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
and you see those there and currently
 
05:01:05.628 --> 05:01:05.638 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Board of Podiatry is a
 
05:01:08.090 --> 05:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
five-member board there were 91 of them
 
05:01:10.190 --> 05:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
05:01:12.530 --> 05:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
Engineers with land surveyors both
 
05:01:14.150 --> 05:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
boards are currently supported by the
 
05:01:16.010 --> 05:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
National Council of examiners for
 
05:01:18.530 --> 05:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
engineering and surveying and 36 states
 
05:01:21.830 --> 05:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
have combined boards nine states only
 
05:01:23.570 --> 05:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
nine states have Standalone engineering
 
05:01:26.090 --> 05:01:26.100 align:start position:0%
boards most of them are fairly large but
 
05:01:28.910 --> 05:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
you see Vermont obviously is not a large
 
05:01:31.190 --> 05:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
board also I would mention that Vermont
 
05:01:33.410 --> 05:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
uses the advisory model that we
 
05:01:34.990 --> 05:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier
 
05:01:38.750 --> 05:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
almost all their boards are advisory and
 
05:01:40.310 --> 05:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
we can get into that a little bit later
 
05:01:43.030 --> 05:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
but it's it's a model that's used
 
05:01:46.550 --> 05:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
Nationwide ah here we go page 12
 
05:01:48.948 --> 05:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
proposed advisory boards
 
05:01:51.890 --> 05:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
so smaller boards and this is no I mean
 
05:01:53.390 --> 05:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
this is true for any profession it's not
 
05:01:54.948 --> 05:01:54.958 align:start position:0%
about a particular profession but
 
05:01:56.570 --> 05:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
smaller boards are at greatest risk of
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
antitrust issues
 
05:01:59.628 --> 05:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
um everybody knows everybody everybody
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
knows who you know who's doing what and
 
05:02:04.670 --> 05:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
with respect to policy autonomous boards
 
05:02:07.310 --> 05:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
that are comprised primarily of active
 
05:02:09.050 --> 05:02:09.060 align:start position:0%
Market participants and those are people
 
05:02:11.330 --> 05:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
in the profession
 
05:02:13.070 --> 05:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
um they that's our Supreme Court or not
 
05:02:14.390 --> 05:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
our Supreme Court the United States
 
05:02:16.010 --> 05:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has said that they are not
 
05:02:19.010 --> 05:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
entitled to immunity and so this puts
 
05:02:20.930 --> 05:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
the state at potential risk of liability
 
05:02:23.288 --> 05:02:23.298 align:start position:0%
if they were to make decisions based on
 
05:02:28.610 --> 05:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
a competitive nature and it it does
 
05:02:31.010 --> 05:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
happen so I mean I won't go into
 
05:02:32.930 --> 05:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
significant details about it but it is
 
05:02:36.050 --> 05:02:36.060 align:start position:0%
it is an issue and that's why a lot of
 
05:02:38.510 --> 05:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
states have moved in the direction of
 
05:02:40.628 --> 05:02:40.638 align:start position:0%
providing State oversight
 
05:02:42.890 --> 05:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
what the United States Supreme Court
 
05:02:45.230 --> 05:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
said in that case was that in order to
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
be entitled to immunity States need to
 
05:02:48.240 --> 05:02:49.270 align:start position:0%
be entitled to immunity States need to
provide

05:02:49.270 --> 05:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
provide
 
05:02:52.670 --> 05:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
oversight and supervision by an actor
 
05:02:55.490 --> 05:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
that is not part of that particular
 
05:02:58.310 --> 05:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
profession so some states have like veto
 
05:02:59.930 --> 05:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
power some states have moved in The
 
05:03:02.990 --> 05:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
Advisory model some states you know use
 
05:03:05.390 --> 05:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
other different models but that really
 
05:03:07.010 --> 05:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
is the basis for the advisory model
 
05:03:09.830 --> 05:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
approach because of the fact that the
 
05:03:11.510 --> 05:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
executive director who's not a member of
 
05:03:13.610 --> 05:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
this profession essentially has veto
 
05:03:15.890 --> 05:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
power it provides the state with
 
05:03:18.948 --> 05:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
immunity that we wouldn't otherwise have
 
05:03:22.310 --> 05:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
so excuse me representative McGuire is a
 
05:03:25.250 --> 05:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you so could
 
05:03:28.368 --> 05:03:28.378 align:start position:0%
just to make this clear what's an advice
 
05:03:30.230 --> 05:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
or full board and what's an Advisory
 
05:03:32.810 --> 05:03:32.820 align:start position:0%
Board could you give us an example based
 
05:03:34.970 --> 05:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
on the page that our chairman was was
 
05:03:38.510 --> 05:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
looking at which was acupuncture
 
05:03:41.208 --> 05:03:41.218 align:start position:0%
right so acupuncture is one that's now a
 
05:03:43.610 --> 05:03:43.620 align:start position:0%
full board and by House Bill 2 would
 
05:03:45.770 --> 05:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
become an Advisory board so could you
 
05:03:48.770 --> 05:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
walk us through an example of somebody
 
05:03:53.150 --> 05:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
has a complaint and it goes to the board
 
05:03:55.850 --> 05:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
and how it's done now how it would be
 
05:03:58.128 --> 05:03:58.138 align:start position:0%
done in the future
 
05:04:00.470 --> 05:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
um and what are the qualifications of
 
05:04:02.090 --> 05:04:02.100 align:start position:0%
the people who work for you that would
 
05:04:03.890 --> 05:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
be working on it and making those
 
05:04:06.288 --> 05:04:06.298 align:start position:0%
decisions and so on certainly
 
05:04:09.470 --> 05:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
um page 104 it's there's not a
 
05:04:13.550 --> 05:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
108 I think is where you were looking no
 
05:04:15.770 --> 05:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
well yeah there's a couple of sections
 
05:04:15.780 --> 05:04:16.730 align:start position:0%
well yeah there's a couple of sections
but

05:04:16.730 --> 05:04:16.740 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:04:20.090 --> 05:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
um 104 108 but it eliminates board
 
05:04:21.948 --> 05:04:21.958 align:start position:0%
altogether it doesn't say an Advisory
 
05:04:23.628 --> 05:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
Board it's just executive director
 
05:04:26.510 --> 05:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's exactly it when it when it
 
05:04:28.490 --> 05:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
takes out the word board and puts in the
 
05:04:32.390 --> 05:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
word executive director it's for a board
 
05:04:35.510 --> 05:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's becoming advisory yes correct
 
05:04:37.010 --> 05:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
there's a separate section that
 
05:04:40.128 --> 05:04:40.138 align:start position:0%
establishes an Advisory Board and sets
 
05:04:41.868 --> 05:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
forth what the executive director has to
 
05:04:44.270 --> 05:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
utilize that Advisory board for could
 
05:04:46.670 --> 05:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
you point that section out to us
 
05:04:48.288 --> 05:04:48.298 align:start position:0%
um I could send that along to your
 
05:04:50.090 --> 05:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
representative I apologize I didn't
 
05:04:53.030 --> 05:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
bring my hard copy of hb2
 
05:04:53.040 --> 05:04:54.770 align:start position:0%
bring my hard copy of hb2
um

05:04:54.770 --> 05:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
I I can I can send it along but that's
 
05:04:59.090 --> 05:04:59.100 align:start position:0%
that's how it works now for the existing
 
05:05:01.788 --> 05:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
advisory boards there's one statute that
 
05:05:01.798 --> 05:05:02.930 align:start position:0%
advisory boards there's one statute that
says

05:05:02.930 --> 05:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
says
 
05:05:05.330 --> 05:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
um is that Advisory board established
 
05:05:07.670 --> 05:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
these are their qualifications but the
 
05:05:09.050 --> 05:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
authority lies with the executive
 
05:05:10.430 --> 05:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
director and the reason for that is
 
05:05:12.890 --> 05:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
because the executive director
 
05:05:15.890 --> 05:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
um is not a part of that particular
 
05:05:17.868 --> 05:05:17.878 align:start position:0%
profession and that's what gives the
 
05:05:21.410 --> 05:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
state immunity when they're um that's
 
05:05:22.788 --> 05:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
what allows the state to provide
 
05:05:26.030 --> 05:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
effective oversight of I understand I
 
05:05:27.890 --> 05:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
know I'm just like going forward that's
 
05:05:29.628 --> 05:05:29.638 align:start position:0%
my question that you're going to send me
 
05:05:33.730 --> 05:05:33.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:37.250 --> 05:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr Hoffman
 
05:05:39.110 --> 05:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
point out this you can point out this
 
05:05:42.170 --> 05:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
section to Mr Hoffman Mr chair uh
 
05:05:44.570 --> 05:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
director Courtney were was what you were
 
05:05:46.368 --> 05:05:46.378 align:start position:0%
saying that you currently have the
 
05:05:49.368 --> 05:05:49.378 align:start position:0%
format with the advisory boards now and
 
05:05:51.590 --> 05:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
so what you're doing is you're expanding
 
05:05:53.570 --> 05:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
the use of that
 
05:05:57.350 --> 05:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
oversight format to more boards correct
 
05:06:00.230 --> 05:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
we already utilize and I can discuss how
 
05:06:02.208 --> 05:06:02.218 align:start position:0%
we how we do it but we already have that
 
05:06:04.850 --> 05:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
process in place
 
05:06:07.250 --> 05:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
so you are referring to page 109
 
05:06:16.190 --> 05:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:16.200 --> 05:06:26.230 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:06:26.230 --> 05:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:28.490 --> 05:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
see where it made a reference to this
 
05:06:31.368 --> 05:06:31.378 align:start position:0%
advice report it just said the executive
 
05:06:31.378 --> 05:06:35.150 align:start position:0%
advice report it just said the executive
director

05:06:35.150 --> 05:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:37.788 --> 05:06:37.798 align:start position:0%
I know it's in there oh here we go
 
05:06:37.798 --> 05:06:38.510 align:start position:0%
I know it's in there oh here we go
um

05:06:38.510 --> 05:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:43.550 --> 05:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:43.560 --> 05:06:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:06:44.150 --> 05:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:47.930 --> 05:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
so line 22 board established the
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
executive director shall establish an
 
05:06:50.750 --> 05:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board
 
05:06:52.670 --> 05:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
so it's Fourth that one shall be a
 
05:06:54.350 --> 05:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
certified acupuncture detoxification
 
05:06:56.570 --> 05:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
specialist into Shelby licensed
 
05:06:56.580 --> 05:06:58.070 align:start position:0%
specialist into Shelby licensed
acupuncturists

05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists
 
05:07:00.350 --> 05:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
and they shall advise the executive
 
05:07:01.850 --> 05:07:01.860 align:start position:0%
director regarding the implementation of
 
05:07:08.810 --> 05:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:12.288 --> 05:07:12.298 align:start position:0%
so in practice how we've done it
 
05:07:12.298 --> 05:07:13.550 align:start position:0%
so in practice how we've done it
um

05:07:13.550 --> 05:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:19.910 --> 05:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:21.650 --> 05:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
so there's really no distinction in
 
05:07:23.390 --> 05:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
terms of how we manage complaints in the
 
05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
office now when we get a complaint for
 
05:07:28.010 --> 05:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
most boards unless they really want to
 
05:07:30.288 --> 05:07:30.298 align:start position:0%
see complaints in advance all of the
 
05:07:31.610 --> 05:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
complaints go to the enforcement
 
05:07:33.288 --> 05:07:33.298 align:start position:0%
Division and the enforcement division
 
05:07:34.730 --> 05:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
will request a response from the
 
05:07:36.650 --> 05:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
licensee unless it's considered an
 
05:07:38.868 --> 05:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
emergency which is usually diversion of
 
05:07:40.250 --> 05:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
drugs or stealing money or something
 
05:07:43.250 --> 05:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
like that and then they get a response
 
05:07:46.190 --> 05:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
from the licensee and it goes to the
 
05:07:47.448 --> 05:07:47.458 align:start position:0%
regulatory body
 
05:07:49.850 --> 05:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
in this case I don't
 
05:07:52.670 --> 05:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
I myself or the hearings officer we
 
05:07:54.890 --> 05:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
don't even see the complaint or the
 
05:07:57.410 --> 05:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
response we convene The Advisory Board
 
05:07:59.208 --> 05:07:59.218 align:start position:0%
and they make a recommendation as to
 
05:08:01.490 --> 05:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
whether or not to proceed to discipline
 
05:08:03.770 --> 05:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
and typically we go along with that
 
05:08:06.110 --> 05:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation there's only been one
 
05:08:07.788 --> 05:08:07.798 align:start position:0%
instance that I can think of where we
 
05:08:08.868 --> 05:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
did not go along with that
 
05:08:10.430 --> 05:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation and it was a legal reason
 
05:08:11.628 --> 05:08:11.638 align:start position:0%
because we didn't think we had
 
05:08:13.970 --> 05:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over it
 
05:08:16.550 --> 05:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
um so in any event uh they will make a
 
05:08:18.350 --> 05:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
decision or a recommendation to proceed
 
05:08:20.930 --> 05:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
to disciplinary action we issue a notice
 
05:08:23.868 --> 05:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
appearing and the case is prosecuted I
 
05:08:25.730 --> 05:08:25.740 align:start position:0%
have to say that I think some advisory
 
05:08:27.770 --> 05:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
boards not all some like that model
 
05:08:31.010 --> 05:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
because it provides them cover in a
 
05:08:31.990 --> 05:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
small community
 
05:08:34.190 --> 05:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
some of them like nursing home
 
05:08:36.230 --> 05:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
administrators my understanding is they
 
05:08:37.910 --> 05:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
don't object to being an Advisory Board
 
05:08:40.430 --> 05:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
they don't like making legal decisions
 
05:08:42.708 --> 05:08:42.718 align:start position:0%
they also don't like being in a small
 
05:08:45.650 --> 05:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
community and being the ones solely
 
05:08:45.660 --> 05:08:46.930 align:start position:0%
community and being the ones solely
responsible

05:08:46.930 --> 05:08:46.940 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
05:08:49.128 --> 05:08:49.138 align:start position:0%
for you know disciplining their
 
05:08:52.490 --> 05:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
colleagues and so it does provide a
 
05:08:53.990 --> 05:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
little cover for those for those
 
05:08:55.850 --> 05:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
individuals so I would say some like it
 
05:08:57.470 --> 05:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
some some don't
 
05:08:59.990 --> 05:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
um but generally the process works
 
05:09:01.368 --> 05:09:01.378 align:start position:0%
really well and it's consistent with
 
05:09:04.190 --> 05:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
whether other states do
 
05:09:07.070 --> 05:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm just not as smart as you are
 
05:09:08.810 --> 05:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
no I don't think that's the case
 
05:09:10.610 --> 05:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
representative language but just going
 
05:09:12.530 --> 05:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
back to the language it says The
 
05:09:14.868 --> 05:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board shall advise the
 
05:09:17.030 --> 05:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
executive director regarding the
 
05:09:20.330 --> 05:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
implementation of this chapter certainly
 
05:09:23.868 --> 05:09:23.878 align:start position:0%
that are going again going to uh
 
05:09:26.810 --> 05:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
page 108 there's nothing about The
 
05:09:29.150 --> 05:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board participating in
 
05:09:32.690 --> 05:09:32.700 align:start position:0%
discipline that's my concern and yeah I
 
05:09:33.890 --> 05:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
see your concern you can certainly
 
05:09:37.250 --> 05:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
change the language to be shall consult
 
05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
with participate we
 
05:09:42.110 --> 05:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't object to anything
 
05:09:44.510 --> 05:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
like that it's our practice to bring
 
05:09:48.288 --> 05:09:48.298 align:start position:0%
them in because they are the experts in
 
05:09:50.628 --> 05:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
their field now I will say some cases
 
05:09:52.430 --> 05:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
are really cut and dry you know for
 
05:09:54.730 --> 05:09:54.740 align:start position:0%
massage we often get complaints of
 
05:09:58.070 --> 05:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
sexual assaults so those are frequent
 
05:09:59.930 --> 05:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
you don't necessarily need expertise for
 
05:10:03.350 --> 05:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
that but we do we do consult with them
 
05:10:03.360 --> 05:10:04.250 align:start position:0%
that but we do we do consult with them
um

05:10:04.250 --> 05:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:06.230 --> 05:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
but uh you could certain we could
 
05:10:07.788 --> 05:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
certainly make that modification and we
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
would support that modification to be
 
05:10:11.030 --> 05:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
crystal clear that they have to be
 
05:10:16.850 --> 05:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:18.948 --> 05:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
it's been my concern that it's a little
 
05:10:20.990 --> 05:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
vague right now because there has been
 
05:10:22.788 --> 05:10:22.798 align:start position:0%
involvement but this is pretty clear
 
05:10:24.948 --> 05:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
language it's bold to know that the
 
05:10:26.868 --> 05:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
board is gone and the executive director
 
05:10:29.868 --> 05:10:29.878 align:start position:0%
is completely responsible for discipline
 
05:10:33.050 --> 05:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
so maybe if it said in consultation with
 
05:10:35.090 --> 05:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
this Advisory board but yeah I think
 
05:10:37.310 --> 05:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
that needs to be tightened up but yeah I
 
05:10:39.830 --> 05:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
think we would support that language and
 
05:10:41.090 --> 05:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
I know that I think it was
 
05:10:42.948 --> 05:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
representative shoe it has been adding
 
05:10:45.288 --> 05:10:45.298 align:start position:0%
that uh to pretty much every bill that
 
05:10:47.628 --> 05:10:47.638 align:start position:0%
we have and we support that
 
05:10:52.550 --> 05:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:56.090 --> 05:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
so with respect to uh so staying on page
 
05:10:57.410 --> 05:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
12 though
 
05:11:00.230 --> 05:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
um you see the list of of words that are
 
05:11:02.150 --> 05:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
proposed to move to or convert to
 
05:11:04.670 --> 05:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
advisory boards all of them have fewer
 
05:11:08.628 --> 05:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
than 200 licensees
 
05:11:08.638 --> 05:11:09.590 align:start position:0%
than 200 licensees
um

05:11:09.590 --> 05:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:09.600 --> 05:11:11.090 align:start position:0%
um
and

05:11:11.090 --> 05:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:11:13.128 --> 05:11:13.138 align:start position:0%
I understand there may be some fear
 
05:11:16.250 --> 05:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
regarding you know moving to advisor is
 
05:11:19.510 --> 05:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
one step closer to being repealed
 
05:11:23.390 --> 05:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
that is not I mean from my perspective
 
05:11:25.070 --> 05:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
um that's not the case again House Bill
 
05:11:28.368 --> 05:11:28.378 align:start position:0%
2 is on oplc's Bill we requested to
 
05:11:32.030 --> 05:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
convert mirt in particular to an
 
05:11:33.830 --> 05:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board last year because there
 
05:11:36.288 --> 05:11:36.298 align:start position:0%
were significant core problems and we
 
05:11:39.170 --> 05:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
had licenses that we couldn't issue and
 
05:11:40.788 --> 05:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
we had disciplinary actions that we
 
05:11:44.390 --> 05:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't take any action on and so but
 
05:11:46.550 --> 05:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
that issue is completely separate and
 
05:11:47.810 --> 05:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
distinct from whether or not the
 
05:11:50.510 --> 05:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
profession should be licensed and I
 
05:11:52.730 --> 05:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
personally don't see these licenses
 
05:11:55.430 --> 05:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
going away
 
05:11:55.440 --> 05:11:57.470 align:start position:0%
going away
um

05:11:57.470 --> 05:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:00.470 --> 05:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
so getting into the proposed repeals I
 
05:12:02.390 --> 05:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
think it's on page 14. I just wanted to
 
05:12:04.070 --> 05:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
provide you with what we were able to
 
05:12:06.470 --> 05:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
come up with in terms of research may or
 
05:12:08.628 --> 05:12:08.638 align:start position:0%
may not be helpful to you
 
05:12:10.788 --> 05:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
um Foresters
 
05:12:13.490 --> 05:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
originally licensed actually second time
 
05:12:15.890 --> 05:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
licensed in 1990 they had been
 
05:12:18.110 --> 05:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
previously licensed but during a sunset
 
05:12:20.510 --> 05:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
review this this body actually repealed
 
05:12:22.570 --> 05:12:22.580 align:start position:0%
their relationship for about 11 years
 
05:12:24.890 --> 05:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
the requirements are essentially just
 
05:12:26.990 --> 05:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
education although there are exemptions
 
05:12:30.288 --> 05:12:30.298 align:start position:0%
for that experience in an examination
 
05:12:32.930 --> 05:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
um based on our available data the state
 
05:12:35.448 --> 05:12:35.458 align:start position:0%
hasn't denied licenses to individual and
 
05:12:36.708 --> 05:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
there's only been one reported
 
05:12:39.170 --> 05:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
disciplinary matter
 
05:12:41.390 --> 05:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
um I think if the license was repealed
 
05:12:42.770 --> 05:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
the state could certainly rely on
 
05:12:44.448 --> 05:12:44.458 align:start position:0%
voluntary National certification there
 
05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
is a national certification Society of
 
05:12:48.948 --> 05:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
American Foresters and I've included
 
05:12:50.930 --> 05:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
based on the Society of American
 
05:12:50.940 --> 05:12:52.208 align:start position:0%
based on the Society of American
Foresters

05:12:52.208 --> 05:12:52.218 align:start position:0%
Foresters
 
05:12:55.550 --> 05:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
a map of which states do license uh
 
05:12:58.010 --> 05:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
Foresters most in the Northeast and
 
05:13:04.250 --> 05:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:06.470 --> 05:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
backing up a little bit to like the
 
05:13:08.990 --> 05:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
medical licensure certainly had that
 
05:13:11.810 --> 05:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
medical license technician over the
 
05:13:15.170 --> 05:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
Exeter Hospital yes issued did you
 
05:13:17.208 --> 05:13:17.218 align:start position:0%
create a new license to try to deal with
 
05:13:19.970 --> 05:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
that or how did that all work out oh
 
05:13:22.850 --> 05:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I guess I struck
 
05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
a nerve there
 
05:13:27.530 --> 05:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh yes I have to say that was before
 
05:13:29.868 --> 05:13:29.878 align:start position:0%
director Courtney was involved
 
05:13:31.730 --> 05:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
05:13:34.750 --> 05:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
05:13:37.970 --> 05:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
registration required not a license
 
05:13:40.128 --> 05:13:40.138 align:start position:0%
there were no technical qualifications
 
05:13:41.930 --> 05:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
at all
 
05:13:45.830 --> 05:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
the sponsor specifically said to Edna
 
05:13:49.190 --> 05:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
that the reason for the registration was
 
05:13:52.310 --> 05:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
to be a hassle to the individuals so
 
05:13:54.590 --> 05:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
that bad actors would not come to New
 
05:13:54.600 --> 05:13:56.208 align:start position:0%
that bad actors would not come to New
Hampshire

05:13:56.208 --> 05:13:56.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:13:56.218 --> 05:13:58.070 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
uh

05:13:58.070 --> 05:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:13:58.080 --> 05:14:00.730 align:start position:0%
uh
despite

05:14:00.730 --> 05:14:00.740 align:start position:0%
despite
 
05:14:03.730 --> 05:14:03.740 align:start position:0%
my opposition among others
 
05:14:07.430 --> 05:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:09.830 --> 05:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
the slight this registration was put
 
05:14:11.270 --> 05:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
into place
 
05:14:14.868 --> 05:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
and it was retained even though
 
05:14:18.288 --> 05:14:18.298 align:start position:0%
the hospital in under question in that
 
05:14:20.810 --> 05:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
one incident was found to be at fault
 
05:14:23.890 --> 05:14:23.900 align:start position:0%
for not supervising him properly
 
05:14:27.050 --> 05:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh it was the like the licensure was
 
05:14:29.390 --> 05:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
maintained on the basis of that single
 
05:14:29.400 --> 05:14:31.250 align:start position:0%
maintained on the basis of that single
anecdotal

05:14:31.250 --> 05:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
anecdotal
 
05:14:34.610 --> 05:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
that one bad actor and I don't believe
 
05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
that there were any significant cases of
 
05:14:41.810 --> 05:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:44.150 --> 05:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
we have a little pause here I just like
 
05:14:46.430 --> 05:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
to recognize any of the division members
 
05:14:48.530 --> 05:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
if we have any questions as we move
 
05:14:52.128 --> 05:14:52.138 align:start position:0%
along thank you chairman chair Maguire
 
05:14:54.890 --> 05:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
the only thing I would add is um I start
 
05:14:57.470 --> 05:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
I wasn't at oplc during that time but I
 
05:15:00.530 --> 05:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
did represent half of the plaintiffs in
 
05:15:04.310 --> 05:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
that case as a practicing attorney
 
05:15:06.170 --> 05:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
um and I can say having gone through
 
05:15:08.750 --> 05:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of pages of Discovery
 
05:15:10.550 --> 05:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
documents that registration would not
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
have prevented what happened at Exeter
 
05:15:14.330 --> 05:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
Hospital and the reason for that is
 
05:15:16.070 --> 05:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
because what happened at Exeter Hospital
 
05:15:18.530 --> 05:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
is that just nobody reported uh
 
05:15:22.910 --> 05:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
misconduct and our licensure laws and
 
05:15:22.920 --> 05:15:24.430 align:start position:0%
misconduct and our licensure laws and
disciplinary

05:15:24.430 --> 05:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
disciplinary
 
05:15:28.910 --> 05:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
setup it requires people to report it's
 
05:15:31.970 --> 05:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
reactive not proactive so it would not
 
05:15:33.650 --> 05:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
have made a difference
 
05:15:36.050 --> 05:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
05:15:36.060 --> 05:15:38.090 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
um

05:15:38.090 --> 05:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:41.330 --> 05:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
so if we had had licensure required for
 
05:15:43.490 --> 05:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
that Tech position
 
05:15:46.670 --> 05:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh I guess it would just be speculation
 
05:15:49.610 --> 05:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
that that would have not occurred but I
 
05:15:51.530 --> 05:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
personally I mean
 
05:15:54.470 --> 05:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
I've I've reviewed again over 65 000
 
05:15:56.868 --> 05:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
pages of documents and I can send you an
 
05:15:58.610 --> 05:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
article that really that I've written
 
05:16:00.470 --> 05:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
that tracks what happened with that case
 
05:16:02.510 --> 05:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
I mean he went from state to state to
 
05:16:05.750 --> 05:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
state and no State ever you know when he
 
05:16:07.310 --> 05:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
was observed passed out in a back
 
05:16:10.550 --> 05:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
bathroom with a needle syringe in his
 
05:16:13.368 --> 05:16:13.378 align:start position:0%
arm never reported it
 
05:16:14.990 --> 05:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
um the authorities law enforcement never
 
05:16:17.930 --> 05:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
followed up on it and so uh criminal
 
05:16:19.910 --> 05:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
history checks wouldn't have done
 
05:16:22.070 --> 05:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
anything uh licensure wouldn't have done
 
05:16:23.868 --> 05:16:23.878 align:start position:0%
anything because it was just never
 
05:16:23.878 --> 05:16:25.368 align:start position:0%
anything because it was just never
reported

05:16:25.368 --> 05:16:25.378 align:start position:0%
reported
 
05:16:27.350 --> 05:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
um he was he went to the next state
 
05:16:30.050 --> 05:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
where he reoffended
 
05:16:32.810 --> 05:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
um before action could be taken and I
 
05:16:35.030 --> 05:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
think States probably just felt oh he's
 
05:16:36.708 --> 05:16:36.718 align:start position:0%
out of our jurisdiction it's probably
 
05:16:39.948 --> 05:16:39.958 align:start position:0%
not worth our resources
 
05:16:42.830 --> 05:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
all right so moving right along yes to
 
05:16:45.708 --> 05:16:45.718 align:start position:0%
Foresters I just provide a difference uh
 
05:16:46.788 --> 05:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
because you know there's been a lot of
 
05:16:47.990 --> 05:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
conversation between National
 
05:16:50.208 --> 05:16:50.218 align:start position:0%
certification versus State licensure so
 
05:16:52.250 --> 05:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
here's a synopsis of what the national
 
05:16:52.260 --> 05:16:54.530 align:start position:0%
here's a synopsis of what the national
certification

05:16:54.530 --> 05:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
certification
 
05:16:57.230 --> 05:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
um requirements are education you have
 
05:16:59.628 --> 05:16:59.638 align:start position:0%
to have at least a bachelor's degree and
 
05:17:01.670 --> 05:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
you have to have certain experience at
 
05:17:03.610 --> 05:17:03.620 align:start position:0%
least five or more years
 
05:17:05.570 --> 05:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
there are continuing education
 
05:17:07.490 --> 05:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
requirements there are ways to file
 
05:17:09.350 --> 05:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
complaints and you do have an
 
05:17:10.610 --> 05:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
opportunity to search for certified
 
05:17:13.010 --> 05:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
professionals interestingly then you
 
05:17:14.510 --> 05:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
have your state licensure requirements
 
05:17:16.788 --> 05:17:16.798 align:start position:0%
appear to be less than the national
 
05:17:19.330 --> 05:17:19.340 align:start position:0%
certification requirements
 
05:17:21.310 --> 05:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
we actually
 
05:17:23.990 --> 05:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
allow individuals with with two-year
 
05:17:24.000 --> 05:17:25.270 align:start position:0%
allow individuals with with two-year
degrees

05:17:25.270 --> 05:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
degrees
 
05:17:27.288 --> 05:17:27.298 align:start position:0%
and if you have eight years of
 
05:17:28.490 --> 05:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
experience you don't need any
 
05:17:31.010 --> 05:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
educational experience at all we do
 
05:17:33.050 --> 05:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
require an examination
 
05:17:35.090 --> 05:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
um that it that appears to be the main
 
05:17:35.100 --> 05:17:36.310 align:start position:0%
um that it that appears to be the main
distinction

05:17:36.310 --> 05:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
05:17:39.410 --> 05:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
with Foresters
 
05:17:41.810 --> 05:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
moving on to page 16 the Allied Health
 
05:17:43.310 --> 05:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
governing board so the Allied Health
 
05:17:45.770 --> 05:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
governing board essentially functioned
 
05:17:49.990 --> 05:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
how oplc functions now they had
 
05:17:50.000 --> 05:17:51.550 align:start position:0%
how oplc functions now they had
Authority

05:17:51.550 --> 05:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
05:17:53.868 --> 05:17:53.878 align:start position:0%
the Allied Health governing board is
 
05:17:55.970 --> 05:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
comprised of the board chair of all of
 
05:17:57.770 --> 05:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
the other governing boards like the
 
05:17:59.390 --> 05:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
occupational government you know therapy
 
05:18:01.850 --> 05:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
governing board physical therapy and
 
05:18:04.570 --> 05:18:04.580 align:start position:0%
they enacted procedural rules
 
05:18:08.330 --> 05:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
but that Authority is now with oplc and
 
05:18:11.330 --> 05:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
so there really is no purpose
 
05:18:13.190 --> 05:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
um for that board this board does not
 
05:18:16.430 --> 05:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
issue any licenses
 
05:18:18.708 --> 05:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
with respect to Landscape Architects all
 
05:18:21.170 --> 05:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
states licensed Landscape Architects I
 
05:18:23.030 --> 05:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
think New Hampshire was the 47th state
 
05:18:24.650 --> 05:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
that began licensing Landscape
 
05:18:26.810 --> 05:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
Architects that was in 2006 and I will
 
05:18:28.250 --> 05:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
forward you the finance committee
 
05:18:29.570 --> 05:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
hearing report
 
05:18:31.850 --> 05:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
um licensure is mandatory you know there
 
05:18:33.708 --> 05:18:33.718 align:start position:0%
are some exceptions but it is mandatory
 
05:18:35.270 --> 05:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
and it's misdemeanor if you're required
 
05:18:37.910 --> 05:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
to be licensing or not there are certain
 
05:18:39.670 --> 05:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
requirements for licensure obviously
 
05:18:42.288 --> 05:18:42.298 align:start position:0%
education experience and exam and that's
 
05:18:44.470 --> 05:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
the exam is through Clark
 
05:18:46.610 --> 05:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
according to our available data we've
 
05:18:48.530 --> 05:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
had zero applicants be denied and zero
 
05:18:51.650 --> 05:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
Enforcement cases and I know that the
 
05:18:54.410 --> 05:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
seals are very important to individuals
 
05:18:56.810 --> 05:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
licensees May purchase a seal noting
 
05:18:58.010 --> 05:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
that they're licensed this is not
 
05:19:00.170 --> 05:19:00.180 align:start position:0%
something our office gives out they they
 
05:19:01.850 --> 05:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
do it on their own
 
05:19:05.330 --> 05:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
so if hb2 passed us proposed obviously
 
05:19:06.650 --> 05:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
the board and the license would be
 
05:19:10.250 --> 05:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
eliminated I think the public could rely
 
05:19:13.150 --> 05:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
on voluntary National certification
 
05:19:17.510 --> 05:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
and previously uh to licensure a lot of
 
05:19:19.670 --> 05:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
licensed individuals sought licensure in
 
05:19:20.990 --> 05:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
other states because they wanted the
 
05:19:23.150 --> 05:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
seal and they would just buy their seal
 
05:19:24.288 --> 05:19:24.298 align:start position:0%
and note that they were licensed
 
05:19:26.690 --> 05:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
elsewhere so I think that could happen
 
05:19:30.410 --> 05:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
as it did prior to 2006 if hb2 passed as
 
05:19:30.420 --> 05:19:33.350 align:start position:0%
as it did prior to 2006 if hb2 passed as
proposed

05:19:33.350 --> 05:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:35.628 --> 05:19:35.638 align:start position:0%
moving on to Natural scientists of
 
05:19:37.610 --> 05:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
course as you're aware there has been
 
05:19:40.850 --> 05:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
significant pushback from the community
 
05:19:43.550 --> 05:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
um and interestingly I believe you heard
 
05:19:45.230 --> 05:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
that I think the association is
 
05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
supportive of merging with the board of
 
05:19:47.638 --> 05:19:49.190 align:start position:0%
supportive of merging with the board of
Architects

05:19:49.190 --> 05:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
Architects
 
05:19:49.200 --> 05:19:51.590 align:start position:0%
Architects
um

05:19:51.590 --> 05:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:54.490 --> 05:19:54.500 align:start position:0%
natural scientists created in 1997
 
05:19:56.570 --> 05:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
there have only been three Enforcement
 
05:19:58.670 --> 05:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
cases and I have to say that if
 
05:20:02.590 --> 05:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative yes yes well
 
05:20:04.910 --> 05:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
emerging Landscape Architects with the
 
05:20:07.190 --> 05:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
board of Architects The Architects don't
 
05:20:10.010 --> 05:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
like it oh certainly certainly I don't I
 
05:20:15.590 --> 05:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:18.410 --> 05:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
so in terms of natural scientists we've
 
05:20:21.170 --> 05:20:21.180 align:start position:0%
only had three Enforcement cases two
 
05:20:23.030 --> 05:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
honestly I
 
05:20:24.770 --> 05:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
there may be a constitutional issue here
 
05:20:27.110 --> 05:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
the two were in 2015 they were related
 
05:20:29.628 --> 05:20:29.638 align:start position:0%
to continuing education the person was
 
05:20:33.230 --> 05:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
essentially voluntary voluntarily
 
05:20:34.970 --> 05:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
surrendered their license which is
 
05:20:37.010 --> 05:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
pretty significant
 
05:20:39.770 --> 05:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
um because they didn't do CES the third
 
05:20:42.770 --> 05:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
one was a voluntary surrender due to a
 
05:20:42.780 --> 05:20:44.090 align:start position:0%
one was a voluntary surrender due to a
conviction

05:20:44.090 --> 05:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
conviction
 
05:20:46.970 --> 05:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
um and I really don't think that under
 
05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
this the new statute that we have that
 
05:20:54.948 --> 05:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
they that that would have been an issue
 
05:20:57.288 --> 05:20:57.298 align:start position:0%
um but in any event if House Bill 2 were
 
05:20:59.150 --> 05:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
passed the state could rely on voluntary
 
05:20:59.160 --> 05:21:01.010 align:start position:0%
passed the state could rely on voluntary
credentials

05:21:01.010 --> 05:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
credentials
 
05:21:03.890 --> 05:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
um several states do one for soil
 
05:21:05.990 --> 05:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
scientists would be the soil science
 
05:21:08.930 --> 05:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
Society of America or Society of wetland
 
05:21:11.448 --> 05:21:11.458 align:start position:0%
scientists and on the following page
 
05:21:13.368 --> 05:21:13.378 align:start position:0%
with respect to soil scientists I give a
 
05:21:14.990 --> 05:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
breakdown of what the national
 
05:21:16.788 --> 05:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
certification does versus what the New
 
05:21:19.208 --> 05:21:19.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state certification does
 
05:21:23.150 --> 05:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
and again in um they're they're pretty
 
05:21:26.810 --> 05:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
comparable in both cases they may file
 
05:21:28.788 --> 05:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
compliances and there's an opportunity
 
05:21:31.070 --> 05:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
for uh for consumers to search for
 
05:21:33.530 --> 05:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
certified professionals
 
05:21:35.868 --> 05:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
with respect to Wetland which is on 21
 
05:21:38.868 --> 05:21:38.878 align:start position:0%
again pretty comparable
 
05:21:38.878 --> 05:21:39.970 align:start position:0%
again pretty comparable
um

05:21:39.970 --> 05:21:39.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:43.010 --> 05:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
this organization notes that individuals
 
05:21:45.650 --> 05:21:45.660 align:start position:0%
can purchase a seal which I know is
 
05:21:47.930 --> 05:21:47.940 align:start position:0%
important to licensees if they have the
 
05:21:50.030 --> 05:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
national certification they also do that
 
05:21:50.930 --> 05:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
if they have the New Hampshire
 
05:21:50.940 --> 05:21:52.970 align:start position:0%
if they have the New Hampshire
certification

05:21:52.970 --> 05:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
certification
 
05:21:55.490 --> 05:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
so getting back to medical technicians
 
05:21:59.628 --> 05:21:59.638 align:start position:0%
which is on page 22 this was created in
 
05:22:01.670 --> 05:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
response I believe to that
 
05:22:03.850 --> 05:22:03.860 align:start position:0%
hepatitis C outbreak at Exeter Hospital
 
05:22:06.350 --> 05:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
essentially what it does is it Regis it
 
05:22:09.410 --> 05:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
requires individuals who are not
 
05:22:11.510 --> 05:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise licensed who may come into
 
05:22:13.970 --> 05:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
contact with a controlled drug to
 
05:22:16.150 --> 05:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
register with our office
 
05:22:19.330 --> 05:22:19.340 align:start position:0%
it's pretty Broad
 
05:22:22.430 --> 05:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
and the issue that we have now and we
 
05:22:24.288 --> 05:22:24.298 align:start position:0%
had proposed last year moving them to an
 
05:22:25.910 --> 05:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board is that they haven't met
 
05:22:28.448 --> 05:22:28.458 align:start position:0%
in over two years
 
05:22:32.270 --> 05:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
and so uh it's essentially not
 
05:22:34.190 --> 05:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
functioning as it was intended so I
 
05:22:35.570 --> 05:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
think something needs to happen with
 
05:22:39.470 --> 05:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
respect to this either way
 
05:22:39.480 --> 05:22:40.070 align:start position:0%
respect to this either way
um

05:22:40.070 --> 05:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:42.410 --> 05:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
we could I could not find any other
 
05:22:44.510 --> 05:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
states that have a similar registration
 
05:22:47.810 --> 05:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
requirement I know some states
 
05:22:50.330 --> 05:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
separately from nursing assistance
 
05:22:52.610 --> 05:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
register people who have direct access
 
05:22:55.150 --> 05:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
to patients but I couldn't find another
 
05:22:58.810 --> 05:22:58.820 align:start position:0%
similar registration in another state
 
05:23:02.270 --> 05:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
except for Illinois so
 
05:23:02.280 --> 05:23:03.288 align:start position:0%
except for Illinois so
um

05:23:03.288 --> 05:23:03.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:06.110 --> 05:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
it I will say that the criteria is very
 
05:23:08.090 --> 05:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
Broad and very vague so it's it's
 
05:23:10.670 --> 05:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
possible that they exist and just my
 
05:23:15.230 --> 05:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:16.788 --> 05:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
um in terms of court reporters on page
 
05:23:19.190 --> 05:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
23 again they're currently an Advisory
 
05:23:21.170 --> 05:23:21.180 align:start position:0%
Board and we just uh probably just
 
05:23:23.208 --> 05:23:23.218 align:start position:0%
enacted their their new rules there are
 
05:23:25.970 --> 05:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
about 66 court reporters
 
05:23:28.190 --> 05:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
um again uh requirements for their
 
05:23:31.250 --> 05:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
initial licensure are listed uh on this
 
05:23:33.230 --> 05:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
page includes a national certification
 
05:23:35.030 --> 05:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
they are not required to maintain their
 
05:23:37.310 --> 05:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
National certification
 
05:23:40.670 --> 05:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
um I will say that the Advisory Board uh
 
05:23:42.110 --> 05:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
is is
 
05:23:46.070 --> 05:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
strongly against D licensure 24 states
 
05:23:47.868 --> 05:23:47.878 align:start position:0%
have either voluntary or no
 
05:23:51.050 --> 05:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
certification for court reporters
 
05:23:51.060 --> 05:23:52.010 align:start position:0%
certification for court reporters
um

05:23:52.010 --> 05:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:53.810 --> 05:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
one thing that The Advisory Board
 
05:23:55.910 --> 05:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
brought up I think it could be addressed
 
05:23:58.730 --> 05:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
within an amendment uh to House Bill 2
 
05:24:02.150 --> 05:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
was that if they if their licensure was
 
05:24:03.948 --> 05:24:03.958 align:start position:0%
repealed they would lose their limited
 
05:24:06.890 --> 05:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
notarial function and they felt that was
 
05:24:09.770 --> 05:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
important to them so I think essentially
 
05:24:12.170 --> 05:24:12.180 align:start position:0%
a grandfathering could address that
 
05:24:14.690 --> 05:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
issue to allow them to continue to
 
05:24:17.930 --> 05:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:20.510 --> 05:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
I will also say in practice in New
 
05:24:20.520 --> 05:24:21.250 align:start position:0%
I will also say in practice in New
Hampshire

05:24:21.250 --> 05:24:21.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:24:23.868 --> 05:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
attorneys typically administer OS when
 
05:24:25.368 --> 05:24:25.378 align:start position:0%
you go into other jurisdictions It's
 
05:24:26.810 --> 05:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
usually the court reporter but in New
 
05:24:26.820 --> 05:24:28.190 align:start position:0%
usually the court reporter but in New
Hampshire

05:24:28.190 --> 05:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:24:29.868 --> 05:24:29.878 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire attorneys typically
 
05:24:31.250 --> 05:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
administer those
 
05:24:33.350 --> 05:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh the manufactured housing complaint
 
05:24:35.448 --> 05:24:35.458 align:start position:0%
board that's on page 24 this is not a
 
05:24:37.368 --> 05:24:37.378 align:start position:0%
licensure board essentially this board
 
05:24:39.590 --> 05:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
is intended to act as an Arbiter or some
 
05:24:41.510 --> 05:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
sort of adjudicative body for disputes
 
05:24:43.128 --> 05:24:43.138 align:start position:0%
between the manufactured housing Park
 
05:24:46.010 --> 05:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
and tenant this is not something I think
 
05:24:47.390 --> 05:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
this has
 
05:24:49.368 --> 05:24:49.378 align:start position:0%
I think the intent is very good I just
 
05:24:51.610 --> 05:24:51.620 align:start position:0%
don't think it it's not being utilized
 
05:24:54.170 --> 05:24:54.180 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice has concurrent
 
05:24:56.050 --> 05:24:56.060 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction I did confirm with them
 
05:24:58.730 --> 05:24:58.740 align:start position:0%
that the Consumer Protection Bureau has
 
05:25:01.788 --> 05:25:01.798 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over these cases it's my
 
05:25:03.410 --> 05:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
understanding that the chair of that
 
05:25:05.410 --> 05:25:05.420 align:start position:0%
particular board
 
05:25:08.030 --> 05:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
has no opposition to this board being
 
05:25:08.040 --> 05:25:09.250 align:start position:0%
has no opposition to this board being
eliminated

05:25:09.250 --> 05:25:09.260 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
05:25:11.750 --> 05:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
that said there's a bill pending in the
 
05:25:13.910 --> 05:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
Senate that I think would would modify
 
05:25:16.310 --> 05:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
this and there's been some concern
 
05:25:19.150 --> 05:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
expressed by members of the public
 
05:25:24.410 --> 05:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:27.610 --> 05:25:27.620 align:start position:0%
regarding Medical Imaging on page 25
 
05:25:31.550 --> 05:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
this also was created in 2016. now there
 
05:25:33.890 --> 05:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
are 10 permanent license types many
 
05:25:36.170 --> 05:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
different temporary licenses so the
 
05:25:37.490 --> 05:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
majority of those that are proposed to
 
05:25:40.250 --> 05:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
be repealed are under this board it is
 
05:25:42.170 --> 05:25:42.180 align:start position:0%
an Advisory Board
 
05:25:42.180 --> 05:25:43.430 align:start position:0%
an Advisory Board
um

05:25:43.430 --> 05:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:45.050 --> 05:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
I will say that the requirements for
 
05:25:46.788 --> 05:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
Education are pretty standard they need
 
05:25:48.770 --> 05:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
a certain level of Education a national
 
05:25:50.810 --> 05:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
exam and typically for most license
 
05:25:52.010 --> 05:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
types they do need a national
 
05:25:52.020 --> 05:25:53.470 align:start position:0%
types they do need a national
certification

05:25:53.470 --> 05:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
certification
 
05:25:56.628 --> 05:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
we haven't had too many issues with
 
05:25:58.550 --> 05:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
respect to those applicants one
 
05:26:00.050 --> 05:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
applicant per permanent licensure has
 
05:26:01.128 --> 05:26:01.138 align:start position:0%
been denied and there's been one
 
05:26:02.390 --> 05:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement matter
 
05:26:05.150 --> 05:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
I will say as a practical matter not all
 
05:26:07.550 --> 05:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
states license these folks and so that
 
05:26:10.430 --> 05:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
has become an issue particularly for
 
05:26:13.550 --> 05:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
endorsement or reciprocity in order to
 
05:26:15.650 --> 05:26:15.660 align:start position:0%
take advantage of our temporary
 
05:26:17.810 --> 05:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
licensure you need to have a license in
 
05:26:20.030 --> 05:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
another state and many of these folks do
 
05:26:23.448 --> 05:26:23.458 align:start position:0%
not and so when they come in we cannot
 
05:26:25.550 --> 05:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
issue them a credential or a license
 
05:26:27.050 --> 05:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly they have to go through
 
05:26:29.510 --> 05:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
the whole process and for these folks a
 
05:26:31.070 --> 05:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
lot of them are traveling healthcare
 
05:26:34.250 --> 05:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
workers so when they come into our state
 
05:26:36.170 --> 05:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
you know maybe on a weekend to assist
 
05:26:38.690 --> 05:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
it's not just for you know I'm going to
 
05:26:41.150 --> 05:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
move here so these are pretty mobile
 
05:26:44.390 --> 05:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
folks and so that aspect is pretty
 
05:26:47.650 --> 05:26:47.660 align:start position:0%
problematic I was able to find that
 
05:26:49.910 --> 05:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
states really approached this license
 
05:26:52.250 --> 05:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
type in various different ways I think
 
05:26:55.368 --> 05:26:55.378 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts lumps them all together in
 
05:26:57.708 --> 05:26:57.718 align:start position:0%
one particular license type which is
 
05:26:59.090 --> 05:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
problematic for the reasons I just
 
05:26:59.100 --> 05:27:00.650 align:start position:0%
problematic for the reasons I just
described

05:27:00.650 --> 05:27:00.660 align:start position:0%
described
 
05:27:02.270 --> 05:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
um but you know sonographers are really
 
05:27:04.550 --> 05:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
my licensed in four states that said
 
05:27:06.530 --> 05:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
radiographers are licensed in 42 States
 
05:27:09.708 --> 05:27:09.718 align:start position:0%
so there's a list right there for your
 
05:27:09.718 --> 05:27:11.448 align:start position:0%
so there's a list right there for your
consideration

05:27:11.448 --> 05:27:11.458 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
05:27:14.448 --> 05:27:14.458 align:start position:0%
I think if House Bill 2 were to pass we
 
05:27:16.670 --> 05:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
would do what we did prior to 2016 which
 
05:27:18.170 --> 05:27:18.180 align:start position:0%
is that Healthcare facilities would
 
05:27:20.890 --> 05:27:20.900 align:start position:0%
continue to require that individuals
 
05:27:23.750 --> 05:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
have National certification and they
 
05:27:25.250 --> 05:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
would also require individuals to
 
05:27:26.990 --> 05:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
undergo criminal history checks and
 
05:27:29.090 --> 05:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facilities would be
 
05:27:33.170 --> 05:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:35.810 --> 05:27:35.820 align:start position:0%
uh turning to almost at the end
 
05:27:37.730 --> 05:27:37.740 align:start position:0%
licensure nursing assistance there's
 
05:27:39.948 --> 05:27:39.958 align:start position:0%
been a lot of conversation about this
 
05:27:39.958 --> 05:27:40.970 align:start position:0%
been a lot of conversation about this
um

05:27:40.970 --> 05:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:43.368 --> 05:27:43.378 align:start position:0%
under the proposal New Hampshire would
 
05:27:44.868 --> 05:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
still be required to register nursing
 
05:27:47.868 --> 05:27:47.878 align:start position:0%
assistance as we're required to do
 
05:27:50.208 --> 05:27:50.218 align:start position:0%
I could not find any state other than
 
05:27:51.850 --> 05:27:51.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that requires both
 
05:27:55.788 --> 05:27:55.798 align:start position:0%
registration and licensure of nursing
 
05:27:57.948 --> 05:27:57.958 align:start position:0%
assistance many states refer to
 
05:28:00.470 --> 05:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
individuals on the registry as being
 
05:28:03.368 --> 05:28:03.378 align:start position:0%
CNAs or certified nursing assistants
 
05:28:05.810 --> 05:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire could choose to eliminate
 
05:28:08.270 --> 05:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
this duplicative licensure requirement
 
05:28:11.090 --> 05:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
but allow nursing assistance to utilize
 
05:28:13.128 --> 05:28:13.138 align:start position:0%
a different title I know title is is
 
05:28:15.650 --> 05:28:15.660 align:start position:0%
very important we've heard that in
 
05:28:15.660 --> 05:28:16.730 align:start position:0%
very important we've heard that in
testimony

05:28:16.730 --> 05:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:28:18.650 --> 05:28:18.660 align:start position:0%
and the following page I just wanted to
 
05:28:23.208 --> 05:28:23.218 align:start position:0%
give you a brief comparison of what the
 
05:28:25.730 --> 05:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
nursing assistant registry is and what
 
05:28:27.530 --> 05:28:27.540 align:start position:0%
the license is
 
05:28:29.570 --> 05:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
so for the register you have to complete
 
05:28:31.368 --> 05:28:31.378 align:start position:0%
a criminal history check that's in DHHS
 
05:28:31.378 --> 05:28:32.390 align:start position:0%
a criminal history check that's in DHHS
regs

05:28:32.390 --> 05:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
regs
 
05:28:34.190 --> 05:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
you have to complete a state approved
 
05:28:36.770 --> 05:28:36.780 align:start position:0%
nursing assistant program under CMS regs
 
05:28:39.590 --> 05:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
it has to be at least 75 hours our regs
 
05:28:43.128 --> 05:28:43.138 align:start position:0%
are 100 hours notably 13 states exceed
 
05:28:45.050 --> 05:28:45.060 align:start position:0%
us significantly by at least 2 20
 
05:28:45.060 --> 05:28:46.310 align:start position:0%
us significantly by at least 2 20
percent

05:28:46.310 --> 05:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:28:48.230 --> 05:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
you have to pass a state approved exam
 
05:28:49.730 --> 05:28:49.740 align:start position:0%
and you have to complete at least 12
 
05:28:52.010 --> 05:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
hours of in-service training per year
 
05:28:54.470 --> 05:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
on the licensure side you have here are
 
05:28:55.910 --> 05:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
the requirements you have to be on the
 
05:28:58.910 --> 05:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
registry and you have to complete a CBC
 
05:29:01.190 --> 05:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
and you have to pay fees and you have to
 
05:29:01.200 --> 05:29:02.288 align:start position:0%
and you have to pay fees and you have to
complete

05:29:02.288 --> 05:29:02.298 align:start position:0%
complete
 
05:29:05.690 --> 05:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
24 hours of CES over the course of two
 
05:29:05.700 --> 05:29:07.910 align:start position:0%
24 hours of CES over the course of two
years

05:29:07.910 --> 05:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:11.150 --> 05:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
on page 30 this outlines the process of
 
05:29:13.550 --> 05:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
what a nursing aide has to go through in
 
05:29:15.470 --> 05:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
order to get licensed they first have to
 
05:29:17.510 --> 05:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
enroll in a nursing assistant program
 
05:29:19.850 --> 05:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
that's board approved and that requires
 
05:29:21.650 --> 05:29:21.660 align:start position:0%
the criminal history check then they
 
05:29:23.090 --> 05:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
complete the program
 
05:29:25.010 --> 05:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
then they complete the competency
 
05:29:27.110 --> 05:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
evaluation then they're placed on the
 
05:29:27.120 --> 05:29:28.128 align:start position:0%
evaluation then they're placed on the
registry

05:29:28.128 --> 05:29:28.138 align:start position:0%
registry
 
05:29:29.810 --> 05:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
and then they have to apply for the
 
05:29:31.250 --> 05:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
license they have to pay the fee and
 
05:29:32.448 --> 05:29:32.458 align:start position:0%
they have to complete the criminal
 
05:29:34.670 --> 05:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
history check and then their issued a
 
05:29:36.590 --> 05:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
license and I think under House Bill 2
 
05:29:38.810 --> 05:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
what this would do was essentially
 
05:29:41.150 --> 05:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
eliminate the last two boxes in this
 
05:29:41.160 --> 05:29:42.890 align:start position:0%
eliminate the last two boxes in this
process

05:29:42.890 --> 05:29:42.900 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:29:44.930 --> 05:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
we had previously proposed to the board
 
05:29:46.730 --> 05:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
of nursing or requested that the Board
 
05:29:48.708 --> 05:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
of Nursing consider just eliminating the
 
05:29:51.288 --> 05:29:51.298 align:start position:0%
fee because that would allow us to use
 
05:29:54.350 --> 05:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
the licensure as the registry
 
05:29:54.360 --> 05:29:55.368 align:start position:0%
the licensure as the registry
um

05:29:55.368 --> 05:29:55.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:57.350 --> 05:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
basically cutting our administrative
 
05:30:00.170 --> 05:30:00.180 align:start position:0%
obligations in half the Board of Nursing
 
05:30:01.670 --> 05:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
at that time didn't want to eliminate
 
05:30:05.448 --> 05:30:05.458 align:start position:0%
the fee because the fee was important in
 
05:30:07.368 --> 05:30:07.378 align:start position:0%
terms of making the
 
05:30:10.430 --> 05:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
lnas feel valued so we didn't eliminate
 
05:30:11.590 --> 05:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
the fee
 
05:30:14.208 --> 05:30:14.218 align:start position:0%
but it was our position that if we were
 
05:30:15.708 --> 05:30:15.718 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the fee we could
 
05:30:17.690 --> 05:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
essentially merge these two
 
05:30:21.530 --> 05:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
because the CMS regulations prohibit us
 
05:30:23.208 --> 05:30:23.218 align:start position:0%
from charging a fee to be on the
 
05:30:24.890 --> 05:30:24.900 align:start position:0%
registry and that's because the state is
 
05:30:29.930 --> 05:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:33.110 --> 05:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
so I have a quick question you you
 
05:30:34.970 --> 05:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
um have mentioned many times about
 
05:30:37.670 --> 05:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
combining boards because of lack of
 
05:30:40.250 --> 05:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
attendance can't get people there I know
 
05:30:42.110 --> 05:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
a number of boards like the prescription
 
05:30:44.628 --> 05:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
drug affordability board
 
05:30:47.330 --> 05:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
um meet online often has that been
 
05:30:49.430 --> 05:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
discussed to get people together versus
 
05:30:51.170 --> 05:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
eliminating the board but allow people
 
05:30:53.810 --> 05:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
to visually hold their hearings or
 
05:30:56.690 --> 05:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
meetings yes 91a does not presently
 
05:30:59.390 --> 05:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
allow a quorum of a board to attend
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
virtually we do live stream our meetings
 
05:31:06.350 --> 05:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
but uh all public bodies are required to
 
05:31:08.750 --> 05:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
have a quorum physically present in
 
05:31:10.368 --> 05:31:10.378 align:start position:0%
order to conduct a meeting in compliance
 
05:31:12.530 --> 05:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
with 91a one of the recommendations that
 
05:31:14.270 --> 05:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
came out of that committee that was
 
05:31:16.310 --> 05:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
established by incentive Bill 330 was to
 
05:31:18.530 --> 05:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
allow our licensure boards to conduct
 
05:31:20.930 --> 05:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
virtual meetings we saw increased
 
05:31:22.730 --> 05:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
attendance when that happened during
 
05:31:22.740 --> 05:31:24.490 align:start position:0%
attendance when that happened during
covid-19

05:31:24.490 --> 05:31:24.500 align:start position:0%
covid-19
 
05:31:26.810 --> 05:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
and there was a bill last year that
 
05:31:29.930 --> 05:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
would propose that but because you know
 
05:31:32.570 --> 05:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
it there you wouldn't be changing it
 
05:31:34.368 --> 05:31:34.378 align:start position:0%
necessarily just for oplc boards it
 
05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
would be for all public bodies
 
05:31:39.288 --> 05:31:39.298 align:start position:0%
um that didn't pass
 
05:31:39.298 --> 05:31:40.750 align:start position:0%
um that didn't pass
hmm

05:31:40.750 --> 05:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
05:31:44.750 --> 05:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
but would it be helpful if it did in if
 
05:31:47.510 --> 05:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
one of the issues is the Quorum issue
 
05:31:49.910 --> 05:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
and if you could loosen up the
 
05:31:51.948 --> 05:31:51.958 align:start position:0%
restrictions a little bit on remote
 
05:31:55.368 --> 05:31:55.378 align:start position:0%
meetings would that be helpful and
 
05:31:57.430 --> 05:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
getting the meetings to take place
 
05:31:59.570 --> 05:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
certainly that was our position last
 
05:32:01.128 --> 05:32:01.138 align:start position:0%
year as well and we had data that was
 
05:32:03.128 --> 05:32:03.138 align:start position:0%
able to support increased attendance
 
05:32:05.990 --> 05:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
Additionally you know it's difficult to
 
05:32:08.208 --> 05:32:08.218 align:start position:0%
get public members it's also difficult
 
05:32:09.770 --> 05:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
to get people from other parts of the
 
05:32:09.780 --> 05:32:11.090 align:start position:0%
to get people from other parts of the
state

05:32:11.090 --> 05:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:32:13.430 --> 05:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
um and it's actually more expensive for
 
05:32:16.010 --> 05:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
us to reimburse mileage costs so we
 
05:32:18.288 --> 05:32:18.298 align:start position:0%
saved a significant almost a hundred
 
05:32:19.610 --> 05:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars when we didn't have to
 
05:32:21.830 --> 05:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
pay for mileage which is you know no
 
05:32:21.840 --> 05:32:22.850 align:start position:0%
pay for mileage which is you know no
small

05:32:22.850 --> 05:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
small
 
05:32:25.990 --> 05:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
chunk of change for us
 
05:32:29.090 --> 05:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
so just as a general matter who is
 
05:32:31.430 --> 05:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
appointing the public members
 
05:32:32.990 --> 05:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's the governor and Council for most
 
05:32:35.690 --> 05:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
appointments and what I can say is we
 
05:32:37.550 --> 05:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
have a really hard time finding public
 
05:32:40.490 --> 05:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
members interested in serving we send
 
05:32:43.970 --> 05:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
out for uh for our board members who are
 
05:32:45.948 --> 05:32:45.958 align:start position:0%
licensed professionals we send out email
 
05:32:48.890 --> 05:32:48.900 align:start position:0%
blasts but there's no body of people
 
05:32:51.708 --> 05:32:51.718 align:start position:0%
that we can send out you know request to
 
05:32:53.628 --> 05:32:53.638 align:start position:0%
to apply we don't get a lot of
 
05:32:55.788 --> 05:32:55.798 align:start position:0%
applications and I know that the
 
05:32:57.350 --> 05:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
governor's office doesn't have a lot of
 
05:32:59.150 --> 05:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
public member applications just sitting
 
05:33:01.430 --> 05:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
there it's just really challenging to
 
05:33:04.010 --> 05:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
find those individuals
 
05:33:06.530 --> 05:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you yes
 
05:33:09.890 --> 05:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
looking at page 30. so you're saying
 
05:33:13.190 --> 05:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
that if if House Bill 2 passed as is the
 
05:33:15.890 --> 05:33:15.900 align:start position:0%
last two boxes would be eliminated but
 
05:33:18.470 --> 05:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
someone to get into the registry would
 
05:33:20.810 --> 05:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
still have done all the training and and
 
05:33:24.530 --> 05:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
been evaluated and so on correct
 
05:33:27.490 --> 05:33:27.500 align:start position:0%
um how does someone get off the registry
 
05:33:30.288 --> 05:33:30.298 align:start position:0%
yeah a complaint process or something
 
05:33:32.810 --> 05:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
like that yeah so we're required
 
05:33:34.610 --> 05:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
um to
 
05:33:36.550 --> 05:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
follow a process
 
05:33:39.470 --> 05:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
so you can get off the registry by not
 
05:33:41.270 --> 05:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
working as a nurse aide within the last
 
05:33:43.610 --> 05:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
two years when you have to renew
 
05:33:46.990 --> 05:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
or there's a disciplinary matter
 
05:33:50.628 --> 05:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
involving fraud waste abuse and I have
 
05:33:52.490 --> 05:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
to say that the majority of LNA cases
 
05:33:55.670 --> 05:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
that we have are fraudway surveys and so
 
05:33:58.190 --> 05:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
there would be you know a finding and
 
05:34:00.410 --> 05:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
you could essentially be deemed not
 
05:34:04.250 --> 05:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
eligible to serve as a nursing assistant
 
05:34:06.770 --> 05:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
man so so
 
05:34:09.410 --> 05:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
therefore there is a still even if the
 
05:34:11.208 --> 05:34:11.218 align:start position:0%
last two boxes are eliminated there's
 
05:34:14.330 --> 05:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
still a disciplinary feature right so
 
05:34:17.570 --> 05:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
yeah yes okay so your your suggestion
 
05:34:20.270 --> 05:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
was call somebody who's on the registry
 
05:34:22.490 --> 05:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
in LNA
 
05:34:24.948 --> 05:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
and we're done is that
 
05:34:26.930 --> 05:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
kind of yeah I mean that's what we've
 
05:34:28.910 --> 05:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
heard is a concern during public
 
05:34:31.128 --> 05:34:31.138 align:start position:0%
testimony is that sense of professional
 
05:34:31.138 --> 05:34:32.628 align:start position:0%
testimony is that sense of professional
identity

05:34:32.628 --> 05:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
identity
 
05:34:34.010 --> 05:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
um and I think that was true with the
 
05:34:36.770 --> 05:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
committee report that was issued in 2019
 
05:34:36.780 --> 05:34:38.810 align:start position:0%
committee report that was issued in 2019
and

05:34:38.810 --> 05:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:34:41.208 --> 05:34:41.218 align:start position:0%
from you know I think you could
 
05:34:44.330 --> 05:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
other states call them CNAs
 
05:34:47.690 --> 05:34:47.700 align:start position:0%
some states call them Nas
 
05:34:49.550 --> 05:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up to representative
 
05:34:51.470 --> 05:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
McGuire where is the disciplinary
 
05:34:55.628 --> 05:34:55.638 align:start position:0%
procedure found in your proposal
 
05:34:58.550 --> 05:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
in this proposal yes since you're making
 
05:35:00.770 --> 05:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
those changes I would assume that or
 
05:35:02.990 --> 05:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
where is your disciplinary procedure
 
05:35:05.628 --> 05:35:05.638 align:start position:0%
that you follow yeah ours are in our PLC
 
05:35:07.970 --> 05:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
200s which I could send to you it's a
 
05:35:10.128 --> 05:35:10.138 align:start position:0%
standardized way that we um conduct both
 
05:35:13.128 --> 05:35:13.138 align:start position:0%
investigations and hearings
 
05:35:16.010 --> 05:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
um I can certainly send those to you I
 
05:35:17.628 --> 05:35:17.638 align:start position:0%
don't think other than with respect to
 
05:35:19.730 --> 05:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
the advisory boards these changes do not
 
05:35:21.410 --> 05:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
propose a change in how we conduct
 
05:35:24.170 --> 05:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings
 
05:35:25.850 --> 05:35:25.860 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned the governor and
 
05:35:27.830 --> 05:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
Council are responsible for the
 
05:35:30.530 --> 05:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
appointing of some of the positions
 
05:35:33.590 --> 05:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
now there's one a mediation board or
 
05:35:35.090 --> 05:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
something and there are like five
 
05:35:37.550 --> 05:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
mediators and that's being reduced to
 
05:35:37.560 --> 05:35:38.690 align:start position:0%
mediators and that's being reduced to
one

05:35:38.690 --> 05:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:35:40.730 --> 05:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
uh and the governor and Council would
 
05:35:42.530 --> 05:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
not be part of that but again it's an
 
05:35:44.030 --> 05:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
executive director that would be
 
05:35:46.610 --> 05:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
appointing that mediator how does
 
05:35:51.530 --> 05:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
why not five and why go to one
 
05:35:53.510 --> 05:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
um that board is very different
 
05:35:56.208 --> 05:35:56.218 align:start position:0%
um unlike most boards that are required
 
05:35:57.470 --> 05:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
to be nominated by the governor and
 
05:35:59.150 --> 05:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
appointed by executive Council or
 
05:36:01.490 --> 05:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
confirmed by executive Council that has
 
05:36:01.500 --> 05:36:02.628 align:start position:0%
confirmed by executive Council that has
separate

05:36:02.628 --> 05:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
separate
 
05:36:04.730 --> 05:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
um private entities and or members of
 
05:36:06.170 --> 05:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
the court and or members of the
 
05:36:08.390 --> 05:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
legislature who are required to sit I
 
05:36:10.730 --> 05:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
think there's only 47 licensees in the
 
05:36:12.708 --> 05:36:12.718 align:start position:0%
board is I want to say about 10 people
 
05:36:15.708 --> 05:36:15.718 align:start position:0%
I'll get you to specific numbers and
 
05:36:17.570 --> 05:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
from my perspective it's largely
 
05:36:17.580 --> 05:36:19.430 align:start position:0%
from my perspective it's largely
dysfunctional

05:36:19.430 --> 05:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional
 
05:36:19.440 --> 05:36:20.208 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional
um

05:36:20.208 --> 05:36:20.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:22.310 --> 05:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
and there needs to be some oversight
 
05:36:22.320 --> 05:36:24.410 align:start position:0%
and there needs to be some oversight
there

05:36:24.410 --> 05:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:36:26.448 --> 05:36:26.458 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions might
 
05:36:28.788 --> 05:36:28.798 align:start position:0%
take a little break here seeing none I
 
05:36:31.128 --> 05:36:31.138 align:start position:0%
guess continue if you would thanks sure
 
05:36:34.128 --> 05:36:34.138 align:start position:0%
I'm almost done so page 31 is just a
 
05:36:36.770 --> 05:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
graphic of what our state requires our
 
05:36:40.250 --> 05:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
state requires 100 hours and a lot of 13
 
05:36:42.590 --> 05:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
other states require more training for
 
05:36:44.030 --> 05:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
nursing assistance actually Maine
 
05:36:47.390 --> 05:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
requires 180 which is interesting and
 
05:36:50.330 --> 05:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
they don't have a licensure requirement
 
05:36:52.490 --> 05:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
uh booths we've already talked about
 
05:36:52.500 --> 05:36:53.510 align:start position:0%
uh booths we've already talked about
this

05:36:53.510 --> 05:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:36:56.150 --> 05:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
um the Board of barbering cosmetology
 
05:36:58.250 --> 05:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
anesthetics supports this based on my
 
05:37:01.430 --> 05:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
research this came around the time of
 
05:37:03.650 --> 05:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
um as actually a mechanism to empower
 
05:37:07.430 --> 05:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
females uh women business owners
 
05:37:09.610 --> 05:37:09.620 align:start position:0%
um they could operate their own business
 
05:37:13.250 --> 05:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
years years ago and but from our
 
05:37:15.890 --> 05:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
perspective the shop is already licensed
 
05:37:18.470 --> 05:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
what happens practically is you may have
 
05:37:20.150 --> 05:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
10 boost within a licensed shop our
 
05:37:22.010 --> 05:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
inspector has to go out to one booth
 
05:37:24.410 --> 05:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
inspect everything come back go out to
 
05:37:25.788 --> 05:37:25.798 align:start position:0%
another Booth inspect everything come
 
05:37:28.670 --> 05:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
back and do that 11 times and it's
 
05:37:31.190 --> 05:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
incredibly ineffective
 
05:37:31.200 --> 05:37:32.990 align:start position:0%
incredibly ineffective
um

05:37:32.990 --> 05:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:35.090 --> 05:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
so the only difference between a booth
 
05:37:36.470 --> 05:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
and a shop is that the booth doesn't
 
05:37:38.150 --> 05:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
have to have the booth itself doesn't
 
05:37:40.430 --> 05:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
have to have running water because the
 
05:37:47.330 --> 05:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:49.010 --> 05:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative could you please come to
 
05:37:53.590 --> 05:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:56.208 --> 05:37:56.218 align:start position:0%
you could just speak into the mic please
 
05:37:59.690 --> 05:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
thanks right sorry
 
05:38:02.330 --> 05:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
I just want to be clear because it says
 
05:38:04.550 --> 05:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
proposes to remove requirement that
 
05:38:06.288 --> 05:38:06.298 align:start position:0%
independent contractors within license
 
05:38:10.190 --> 05:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
shopped shops be licensed so to me it
 
05:38:12.288 --> 05:38:12.298 align:start position:0%
reads that the hairdressers don't need
 
05:38:15.470 --> 05:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
to be licensed no so the booth in order
 
05:38:17.990 --> 05:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
to operate a booth know you have to be
 
05:38:20.288 --> 05:38:20.298 align:start position:0%
an independent contractor
 
05:38:24.170 --> 05:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
not employed and that's a labor issue
 
05:38:27.170 --> 05:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
that really should be a DOL issue that
 
05:38:29.810 --> 05:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
our inspectors have been inspecting
 
05:38:32.750 --> 05:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
but what we are saying that is that you
 
05:38:37.250 --> 05:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay the statute does the proposed
 
05:38:43.070 --> 05:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
statute does I I I hear what you're
 
05:38:43.080 --> 05:38:44.390 align:start position:0%
statute does I I I hear what you're
saying

05:38:44.390 --> 05:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
saying
 
05:38:45.948 --> 05:38:45.958 align:start position:0%
um yeah so
 
05:38:45.958 --> 05:38:46.670 align:start position:0%
um yeah so
um

05:38:46.670 --> 05:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:49.128 --> 05:38:49.138 align:start position:0%
but again the Board of barbering is
 
05:38:51.350 --> 05:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
fully supportive of that because the
 
05:38:53.330 --> 05:38:53.340 align:start position:0%
booth licensure does not help facilitate
 
05:38:55.788 --> 05:38:55.798 align:start position:0%
increased public protection
 
05:38:58.368 --> 05:38:58.378 align:start position:0%
and then finally I wanted to address the
 
05:39:00.708 --> 05:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
issue of The Proposal regarding massage
 
05:39:02.868 --> 05:39:02.878 align:start position:0%
therapy establishment licensure this has
 
05:39:04.610 --> 05:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
been before this body numerous times
 
05:39:06.948 --> 05:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
including this year
 
05:39:06.958 --> 05:39:07.610 align:start position:0%
including this year
um

05:39:07.610 --> 05:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:11.510 --> 05:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
but it continues to be problematic
 
05:39:13.910 --> 05:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
our massage therapy licensure laws and
 
05:39:15.650 --> 05:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
this is an Advisory board so this is
 
05:39:17.448 --> 05:39:17.458 align:start position:0%
directly regulated by the agency with
 
05:39:20.690 --> 05:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
the advice of three massage therapists
 
05:39:24.470 --> 05:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
it does not allow us to effectively
 
05:39:24.480 --> 05:39:26.330 align:start position:0%
it does not allow us to effectively
adjudicate

05:39:26.330 --> 05:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
adjudicate
 
05:39:29.810 --> 05:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
um or help prevent our licensure laws
 
05:39:32.690 --> 05:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
from being utilized to facilitate sex
 
05:39:34.850 --> 05:39:34.860 align:start position:0%
and labor trafficking
 
05:39:36.708 --> 05:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
um it's a serious problem that's
 
05:39:38.810 --> 05:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
happening Nationwide and I gave you some
 
05:39:40.550 --> 05:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
statistics from the Federation of State
 
05:39:43.490 --> 05:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
Massage Therapy boards
 
05:39:46.190 --> 05:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
um between 6 500 and 9000 enlisted
 
05:39:48.890 --> 05:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
businesses use massage or Bodywork as a
 
05:39:50.270 --> 05:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
front for prostitution in the United
 
05:39:53.090 --> 05:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
States our current disciplinary and
 
05:39:53.100 --> 05:39:54.368 align:start position:0%
States our current disciplinary and
investigative

05:39:54.368 --> 05:39:54.378 align:start position:0%
investigative
 
05:39:57.230 --> 05:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
framework only allows us to be reactive
 
05:39:59.208 --> 05:39:59.218 align:start position:0%
we can't conduct inspections because we
 
05:40:01.550 --> 05:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
don't have establishment licensure on
 
05:40:02.810 --> 05:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
the few times that we've gotten
 
05:40:04.910 --> 05:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
complaints we've gone out there I can
 
05:40:07.070 --> 05:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
tell you stories people running out the
 
05:40:11.628 --> 05:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
back and then they just stop working in
 
05:40:13.788 --> 05:40:13.798 align:start position:0%
that particular area and they set up
 
05:40:16.550 --> 05:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
shop down the street and we have
 
05:40:18.708 --> 05:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
received licensure applications from
 
05:40:20.868 --> 05:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
certain parts of the country that we
 
05:40:20.878 --> 05:40:22.030 align:start position:0%
certain parts of the country that we
know

05:40:22.030 --> 05:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:40:25.128 --> 05:40:25.138 align:start position:0%
likely are our
 
05:40:28.250 --> 05:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
are producing uh folks who are coming
 
05:40:30.230 --> 05:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
here to be trafficked but there's
 
05:40:32.510 --> 05:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
nothing in our massage therapy licensure
 
05:40:35.150 --> 05:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
laws that allow me to say you're from
 
05:40:37.670 --> 05:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
Flushing New York this is a problem and
 
05:40:39.830 --> 05:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
I can't check up on that because we
 
05:40:42.230 --> 05:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
don't have establishment licensure
 
05:40:46.150 --> 05:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
and I think that this um
 
05:40:46.160 --> 05:40:47.810 align:start position:0%
and I think that this um
okay

05:40:47.810 --> 05:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:40:50.208 --> 05:40:50.218 align:start position:0%
it just needs to be it needs to be
 
05:40:53.208 --> 05:40:53.218 align:start position:0%
addressed on page 34 you can see a map
 
05:40:58.010 --> 05:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:00.470 --> 05:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
yeah it's also proposed to be in house
 
05:41:05.628 --> 05:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:09.410 --> 05:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:16.070 --> 05:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:18.890 --> 05:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
yes that was one of the edits in the
 
05:41:22.070 --> 05:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
first amendment I brought because based
 
05:41:25.730 --> 05:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
on the results on House Bill 341 the
 
05:41:27.310 --> 05:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
house position is the massage
 
05:41:30.470 --> 05:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
establishments do not need licensure
 
05:41:32.750 --> 05:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
therefore we deleted it from house bill
 
05:41:32.760 --> 05:41:35.570 align:start position:0%
therefore we deleted it from house bill
2.

05:41:35.570 --> 05:41:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:38.390 --> 05:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
it well representative groda looks like
 
05:41:41.030 --> 05:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
she has a comment that's your opinion no
 
05:41:47.208 --> 05:41:47.218 align:start position:0%
it it was not a consent uh calendar item
 
05:41:49.490 --> 05:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
it was it was debated and fought on the
 
05:41:51.890 --> 05:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
floor but the result was the house bill
 
05:41:54.770 --> 05:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
341 was was killed and therefore that's
 
05:41:57.410 --> 05:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
the house position
 
05:41:57.420 --> 05:42:00.550 align:start position:0%
the house position
foreign

05:42:00.550 --> 05:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:02.570 --> 05:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
with full respect to all different
 
05:42:05.390 --> 05:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
professions you know it's proposed that
 
05:42:07.788 --> 05:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
we retain licensure Foresters we retain
 
05:42:09.350 --> 05:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
licensure of natural scientists very
 
05:42:11.510 --> 05:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
important but there are no issues with
 
05:42:13.070 --> 05:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
child sex trafficking
 
05:42:14.990 --> 05:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
there's a clear public protection issue
 
05:42:17.510 --> 05:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
with respect to massage therapy and the
 
05:42:19.190 --> 05:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
fact that our laws are facilitating this
 
05:42:21.890 --> 05:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
conduct in our state and so if the house
 
05:42:23.448 --> 05:42:23.458 align:start position:0%
is going to take the position that we
 
05:42:24.708 --> 05:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
should continue to license certain
 
05:42:26.570 --> 05:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
technical professions because it would
 
05:42:29.050 --> 05:42:29.060 align:start position:0%
be too difficult to do repeals of other
 
05:42:32.570 --> 05:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
ordinances or people need seals why are
 
05:42:33.948 --> 05:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
we not establishing massage
 
05:42:36.110 --> 05:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
establishment licensure when there is a
 
05:42:39.470 --> 05:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
known sex trafficking issue in our state
 
05:42:41.750 --> 05:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
so that would be my only comment
 
05:42:44.208 --> 05:42:44.218 align:start position:0%
I have to address that with all the
 
05:42:47.270 --> 05:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
members that voted against uh 341. well
 
05:42:49.490 --> 05:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
this is another opportunity
 
05:42:51.288 --> 05:42:51.298 align:start position:0%
well there may be a conflict because
 
05:42:54.530 --> 05:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
often we don't put house positions that
 
05:42:57.470 --> 05:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
aren't supported in the finance budget
 
05:43:00.770 --> 05:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
so yes I mean the
 
05:43:03.230 --> 05:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
the most convincing argument I believe
 
05:43:06.530 --> 05:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
against House Bill 341 is that The
 
05:43:09.190 --> 05:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
Regulators should not be used to enforce
 
05:43:12.050 --> 05:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
Criminal Just sanctioned criminal
 
05:43:15.470 --> 05:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
Behavior it six trafficking is a crime
 
05:43:17.810 --> 05:43:17.820 align:start position:0%
child abuse is a crime
 
05:43:20.330 --> 05:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
we don't want the licensing clerks to go
 
05:43:22.128 --> 05:43:22.138 align:start position:0%
there and say oh my goodness it looks
 
05:43:24.070 --> 05:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
like there's sex trafficking going on
 
05:43:26.628 --> 05:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
they don't have the skills they they
 
05:43:28.788 --> 05:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
aren't aren't trained for it we want law
 
05:43:30.590 --> 05:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement to deal with with criminal
 
05:43:30.600 --> 05:43:32.208 align:start position:0%
enforcement to deal with with criminal
issues

05:43:32.208 --> 05:43:32.218 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:43:34.730 --> 05:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
I would just say that
 
05:43:36.350 --> 05:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
um and I appreciate the House's position
 
05:43:38.690 --> 05:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
and this has been fully vetted
 
05:43:38.700 --> 05:43:39.470 align:start position:0%
and this has been fully vetted
um

05:43:39.470 --> 05:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:41.990 --> 05:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
the reason why we have administrative
 
05:43:44.150 --> 05:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
regulations and specifically licensures
 
05:43:46.788 --> 05:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
to protect the public and we frequently
 
05:43:50.628 --> 05:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
run across uh criminal activity just had
 
05:43:52.070 --> 05:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
one the other day significant
 
05:43:53.990 --> 05:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
embezzlement issues we refer that to law
 
05:43:56.270 --> 05:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement but we still continue with
 
05:43:58.548 --> 05:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
our administrative action because we
 
05:44:00.590 --> 05:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be allowing those people to
 
05:44:02.690 --> 05:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
practice and work in New Hampshire if
 
05:44:03.948 --> 05:44:03.958 align:start position:0%
there's a significant public health
 
05:44:06.830 --> 05:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
safety risk and by establishing massage
 
05:44:08.690 --> 05:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
establishment licensure like we have
 
05:44:11.090 --> 05:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
with salons that don't have it
 
05:44:11.100 --> 05:44:12.310 align:start position:0%
with salons that don't have it
demonstrated

05:44:12.310 --> 05:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
demonstrated
 
05:44:17.150 --> 05:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
issue with trafficking it allows us to
 
05:44:19.190 --> 05:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
conduct inspections and make sure that
 
05:44:21.770 --> 05:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
that that it's on the up and up that
 
05:44:24.830 --> 05:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
people are are performing services in a
 
05:44:29.590 --> 05:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
sanitized Manner and that our licensees
 
05:44:31.730 --> 05:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
are are doing what they need to be doing
 
05:44:33.770 --> 05:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
and that they're
 
05:44:36.288 --> 05:44:36.298 align:start position:0%
they're not being besmerged by the fact
 
05:44:38.690 --> 05:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
that people are coming in and utilizing
 
05:44:40.970 --> 05:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
our licensure authority to conduct
 
05:44:43.610 --> 05:44:43.620 align:start position:0%
criminal Behavior representative would
 
05:44:49.010 --> 05:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:51.830 --> 05:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm finally understanding this so
 
05:44:55.128 --> 05:44:55.138 align:start position:0%
the the well to me this whole exercise
 
05:44:57.470 --> 05:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
is proof of why this is way too
 
05:44:59.570 --> 05:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
complicated for us to get done in the
 
05:45:03.410 --> 05:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
next two days but so massage therapists
 
05:45:06.590 --> 05:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
can be are are required to be licensed
 
05:45:09.350 --> 05:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
but the establishments in which they
 
05:45:12.650 --> 05:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
work are not is that right and so what
 
05:45:15.350 --> 05:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
happens is uh somebody will open up a
 
05:45:18.890 --> 05:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
massage therapy shop and that it could
 
05:45:22.250 --> 05:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
be somebody who is trafficking in people
 
05:45:24.410 --> 05:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
from this day to perform services that
 
05:45:27.048 --> 05:45:27.058 align:start position:0%
are not massage therapy they may or may
 
05:45:29.448 --> 05:45:29.458 align:start position:0%
not go and purchase massage therapy
 
05:45:31.070 --> 05:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
transcripts that look
 
05:45:31.080 --> 05:45:33.170 align:start position:0%
transcripts that look
real

05:45:33.170 --> 05:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
real
 
05:45:35.990 --> 05:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
um and then they traffic in typically
 
05:45:39.288 --> 05:45:39.298 align:start position:0%
women and that and then when somebody
 
05:45:41.570 --> 05:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
becomes aware of what's going on they
 
05:45:44.090 --> 05:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
move on to another jurisdiction and
 
05:45:45.288 --> 05:45:45.298 align:start position:0%
because we don't have inspection
 
05:45:46.910 --> 05:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
Authority unless we've received a
 
05:45:50.208 --> 05:45:50.218 align:start position:0%
complaint there's no way for us to go in
 
05:45:52.910 --> 05:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
and determine that they're complying
 
05:45:55.270 --> 05:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
with the regulations
 
05:45:58.788 --> 05:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
represented grow to please
 
05:46:00.410 --> 05:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that I did not mention
 
05:46:02.990 --> 05:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
this when I spoke with you
 
05:46:06.890 --> 05:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
it is because although it is my bill
 
05:46:08.810 --> 05:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
and our committee sent you to the floor
 
05:46:11.628 --> 05:46:11.638 align:start position:0%
without recommendation and the house did
 
05:46:13.670 --> 05:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
not approve it
 
05:46:16.850 --> 05:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
I did not want to appear
 
05:46:20.208 --> 05:46:20.218 align:start position:0%
that I would be biased in asking you to
 
05:46:22.910 --> 05:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
keep that in house bill 2. I want my
 
05:46:28.850 --> 05:46:28.860 align:start position:0%
testimony to rest only on its merits
 
05:46:32.448 --> 05:46:32.458 align:start position:0%
so that's why I didn't include it
 
05:46:37.250 --> 05:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:39.470 --> 05:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
is I think I've provided my opinion and
 
05:46:40.670 --> 05:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
I made it happy to take any other
 
05:46:42.650 --> 05:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
questions I appreciate I very much
 
05:46:44.750 --> 05:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time I know I've taken
 
05:46:45.830 --> 05:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
up a lot of it
 
05:46:45.840 --> 05:46:48.048 align:start position:0%
up a lot of it
um

05:46:48.048 --> 05:46:48.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:50.208 --> 05:46:50.218 align:start position:0%
so now I'll go just strictly to the
 
05:46:52.610 --> 05:46:52.620 align:start position:0%
finance piece I'm sure there's uh that
 
05:46:54.170 --> 05:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
you've included we've seen this number
 
05:46:56.990 --> 05:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
before that yes your proposal would
 
05:46:57.000 --> 05:46:58.250 align:start position:0%
before that yes your proposal would
eliminate

05:46:58.250 --> 05:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
05:47:00.770 --> 05:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
about nine hundred and fifty thousand
 
05:47:03.310 --> 05:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
dollars coming back to the state
 
05:47:05.930 --> 05:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
how do you intend to
 
05:47:08.208 --> 05:47:08.218 align:start position:0%
fund your
 
05:47:11.330 --> 05:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
new proposal with increased fees because
 
05:47:13.490 --> 05:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
you're obviously not going to let any
 
05:47:15.288 --> 05:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
staff go I didn't see a reduction of
 
05:47:17.930 --> 05:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
Staff in your budget proposal
 
05:47:20.750 --> 05:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
um so our proposal was prior to hb2
 
05:47:23.208 --> 05:47:23.218 align:start position:0%
coming out so the agency obviously had
 
05:47:24.650 --> 05:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
to submit its proposal based on the
 
05:47:26.448 --> 05:47:26.458 align:start position:0%
current statutory framework
 
05:47:29.750 --> 05:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not convinced that you know if you
 
05:47:31.490 --> 05:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
eliminate the license types that are
 
05:47:33.948 --> 05:47:33.958 align:start position:0%
proposed to be eliminated including the
 
05:47:36.170 --> 05:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
duplicative nature of Licensing nursing
 
05:47:37.970 --> 05:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
assistance that's a significant amount
 
05:47:39.830 --> 05:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
of work
 
05:47:42.288 --> 05:47:42.298 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not convinced that we would
 
05:47:44.948 --> 05:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
require as much administrative support
 
05:47:47.570 --> 05:47:47.580 align:start position:0%
and would likely see some changes in
 
05:47:51.250 --> 05:47:51.260 align:start position:0%
reductions and expenditures as a result
 
05:47:54.890 --> 05:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
we do need to look at fees and part of
 
05:47:57.770 --> 05:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
that is because many boards are paying
 
05:47:59.090 --> 05:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
way more than they should and many
 
05:48:00.948 --> 05:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
boards are not paying enough cosmetology
 
05:48:03.708 --> 05:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
being a prime example we haven't been
 
05:48:05.570 --> 05:48:05.580 align:start position:0%
able to level set those fees yet because
 
05:48:07.788 --> 05:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
we required statutory changes which we
 
05:48:09.530 --> 05:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
just received
 
05:48:09.540 --> 05:48:10.190 align:start position:0%
just received
um

05:48:10.190 --> 05:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:13.190 --> 05:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
so we do plan on doing that I don't
 
05:48:16.930 --> 05:48:16.940 align:start position:0%
anticipate significant increases in fees
 
05:48:19.690 --> 05:48:19.700 align:start position:0%
as a result
 
05:48:22.730 --> 05:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
representative Carol McGuire followed by
 
05:48:25.128 --> 05:48:25.138 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair I'd like to
 
05:48:27.770 --> 05:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
mention that we had a bill House Bill
 
05:48:27.780 --> 05:48:29.690 align:start position:0%
mention that we had a bill House Bill
445

05:48:29.690 --> 05:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
445
 
05:48:31.548 --> 05:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
that would
 
05:48:31.558 --> 05:48:33.110 align:start position:0%
that would
keep

05:48:33.110 --> 05:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
keep
 
05:48:33.120 --> 05:48:34.850 align:start position:0%
keep
the

05:48:34.850 --> 05:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:48:37.368 --> 05:48:37.378 align:start position:0%
um create a non-lapsing fund for the
 
05:48:40.250 --> 05:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
license fees during the hearings on that
 
05:48:43.788 --> 05:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
we heard that oplc typically
 
05:48:46.850 --> 05:48:46.860 align:start position:0%
lapses several million dollars back to
 
05:48:49.430 --> 05:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
the general fund so that the license
 
05:48:53.090 --> 05:48:53.100 align:start position:0%
fees at their current level are more
 
05:48:55.970 --> 05:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
more than enough even after that million
 
05:48:58.548 --> 05:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
dollar reduction are adequate to cover
 
05:49:00.350 --> 05:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
the cost of
 
05:49:04.070 --> 05:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
of the operations without assuming any
 
05:49:05.690 --> 05:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
of the efficiencies that we are
 
05:49:07.368 --> 05:49:07.378 align:start position:0%
confident will happen
 
05:49:07.378 --> 05:49:08.868 align:start position:0%
confident will happen
so

05:49:08.868 --> 05:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:49:11.750 --> 05:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
no I just caught our eye that would be a
 
05:49:13.788 --> 05:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
substantial reduction of nearly a
 
05:49:15.410 --> 05:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars and what was coming back
 
05:49:18.250 --> 05:49:18.260 align:start position:0%
to the state that's all uh yes
 
05:49:22.670 --> 05:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
but the house bill 445 making that a
 
05:49:26.330 --> 05:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund has passed the house it
 
05:49:30.048 --> 05:49:30.058 align:start position:0%
is currently in ways and means
 
05:49:33.170 --> 05:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
for their analysis and we'll see what
 
05:49:35.390 --> 05:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
comes out of them they're the experts on
 
05:49:38.750 --> 05:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
funding from an Eda point of view we
 
05:49:41.868 --> 05:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
felt that allowing large amounts of
 
05:49:45.708 --> 05:49:45.718 align:start position:0%
money from license fees to lapse to the
 
05:49:47.048 --> 05:49:47.058 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
05:49:49.850 --> 05:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
beyond the cost of operating the office
 
05:49:51.708 --> 05:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
and doing in doing everything else
 
05:49:54.708 --> 05:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
that's necessary turns the license fee
 
05:49:57.170 --> 05:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
into a tax and we've had information
 
05:49:58.910 --> 05:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:50:03.410 --> 05:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh unconstitutional and not allowed
 
05:50:06.170 --> 05:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
well representative Dan Maguire for some
 
05:50:09.288 --> 05:50:09.298 align:start position:0%
we don't have income tax so I didn't I
 
05:50:11.270 --> 05:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
heard we had an income tax from you just
 
05:50:13.310 --> 05:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
the other day yeah except except for the
 
05:50:16.670 --> 05:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
IND tax anyways uh all right where was
 
05:50:19.970 --> 05:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
it going so did I hear you say that
 
05:50:22.730 --> 05:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
you don't think the fee that L A's pay
 
05:50:27.410 --> 05:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:29.868 --> 05:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
thirty five dollars and the average cost
 
05:50:34.010 --> 05:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
of a two-year license is 155. now the
 
05:50:36.048 --> 05:50:36.058 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing has decided that it
 
05:50:38.930 --> 05:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
would like to subsidize lnas but the
 
05:50:41.750 --> 05:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing is obviously they also
 
05:50:43.670 --> 05:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
haven't raised their fees in a while the
 
05:50:46.788 --> 05:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
RNs pay 80 and the aprns pay I believe
 
05:50:49.250 --> 05:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
100 and 100
 
05:50:51.470 --> 05:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
05:50:53.750 --> 05:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'm you know I'd have to look at the
 
05:50:55.610 --> 05:50:55.620 align:start position:0%
numbers again today but I'm not sure
 
05:50:57.170 --> 05:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
that the Board of Nursing is covering
 
05:50:59.868 --> 05:50:59.878 align:start position:0%
its costs and and so there's probably a
 
05:51:01.910 --> 05:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
lot more lnas than the other types of
 
05:51:05.270 --> 05:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
nurses also yes I believe there are 12
 
05:51:08.150 --> 05:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
000 lnas certainly not that many that
 
05:51:10.430 --> 05:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
are currently practicing
 
05:51:13.070 --> 05:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
um I think if if the licensure were
 
05:51:14.930 --> 05:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
eliminated we would be able to better
 
05:51:17.510 --> 05:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
calculate the amount of work that we are
 
05:51:20.208 --> 05:51:20.218 align:start position:0%
doing to register these individuals and
 
05:51:21.910 --> 05:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
we would be able to
 
05:51:24.530 --> 05:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
seek more funding from the federal
 
05:51:26.570 --> 05:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
government I don't think we're getting
 
05:51:29.390 --> 05:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
what we are entitled to under their
 
05:51:31.128 --> 05:51:31.138 align:start position:0%
regulations in order to manage their
 
05:51:33.230 --> 05:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
registry but because the the
 
05:51:35.750 --> 05:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
administrative process is just too
 
05:51:37.730 --> 05:51:37.740 align:start position:0%
intertwined we haven't been able to
 
05:51:42.830 --> 05:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:46.010 --> 05:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
other questions from uh division members
 
05:51:48.230 --> 05:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative evil well I just noticed
 
05:51:50.570 --> 05:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
on page 36 you did say that there's a
 
05:51:52.850 --> 05:51:52.860 align:start position:0%
potential increase in revenue from the
 
05:51:55.548 --> 05:51:55.558 align:start position:0%
universal licensure
 
05:51:58.070 --> 05:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so because we saw when we
 
05:52:00.890 --> 05:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
instituted those changes uh we saw an
 
05:52:03.288 --> 05:52:03.298 align:start position:0%
increase of 10 in the number of licenses
 
05:52:07.690 --> 05:52:07.700 align:start position:0%
Statewide so I would anticipate that by
 
05:52:10.310 --> 05:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
reducing barriers increasing portability
 
05:52:11.690 --> 05:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
that we would see people taking
 
05:52:14.150 --> 05:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
advantage of that another question yeah
 
05:52:16.010 --> 05:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
and then as far as all the different
 
05:52:18.048 --> 05:52:18.058 align:start position:0%
boards that are being converted
 
05:52:18.058 --> 05:52:20.150 align:start position:0%
boards that are being converted
eliminated

05:52:20.150 --> 05:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
05:52:23.448 --> 05:52:23.458 align:start position:0%
did did they have input into the
 
05:52:26.810 --> 05:52:26.820 align:start position:0%
decisions that are embodied in hb2 now
 
05:52:34.070 --> 05:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:36.770 --> 05:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
well seeing no yes representative grassy
 
05:52:38.390 --> 05:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
please just just one comment I just
 
05:52:39.708 --> 05:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that it was my bill
 
05:52:42.530 --> 05:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
that I introduced back in 1979 that
 
05:52:43.910 --> 05:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
created the licensure for massage
 
05:52:46.970 --> 05:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
therapist oh thank you
 
05:52:49.010 --> 05:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
and originally or I don't know if
 
05:52:51.110 --> 05:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
originally but we used to have massage
 
05:52:56.390 --> 05:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:57.890 --> 05:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
may have been in the bill it's been a
 
05:53:01.368 --> 05:53:01.378 align:start position:0%
long time yes so
 
05:53:03.288 --> 05:53:03.298 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time well thank you
 
05:53:05.510 --> 05:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
very much who appreciated the division
 
05:53:07.788 --> 05:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
will make a decision next week I don't
 
05:53:10.250 --> 05:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
want to do anything today representative
 
05:53:12.830 --> 05:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
Hewitt and Sweeney are not here to
 
05:53:12.840 --> 05:53:14.030 align:start position:0%
Hewitt and Sweeney are not here to
participate

05:53:14.030 --> 05:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
participate
 
05:53:18.770 --> 05:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:21.288 --> 05:53:21.298 align:start position:0%
um we generally don't allow people from
 
05:53:23.030 --> 05:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
the public to speak during just work
 
05:53:26.150 --> 05:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
sessions but I'll Grant you the request
 
05:53:29.090 --> 05:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
but if you could make it oh no look at
 
05:53:31.250 --> 05:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
the folks now want to stand up and speak
 
05:53:31.260 --> 05:53:32.628 align:start position:0%
the folks now want to stand up and speak
but

05:53:32.628 --> 05:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:53:34.070 --> 05:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
the only thing I would say is I'm happy
 
05:53:35.990 --> 05:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
to make myself available between now and
 
05:53:37.670 --> 05:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
whenever if you have any additional
 
05:53:41.990 --> 05:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:44.570 --> 05:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
we'll hold you to three minutes so if
 
05:53:48.770 --> 05:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:50.868 --> 05:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
I'm Dr Deborah Warner from Littleton as
 
05:53:53.990 --> 05:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know I testified on Monday
 
05:53:56.448 --> 05:53:56.458 align:start position:0%
um I want to bring up one small
 
05:53:59.930 --> 05:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
suggestion for this committee is that
 
05:54:01.368 --> 05:54:01.378 align:start position:0%
um I am
 
05:54:05.770 --> 05:54:05.780 align:start position:0%
very concerned that these matters are
 
05:54:09.350 --> 05:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
layering upon your expertise in a
 
05:54:11.810 --> 05:54:11.820 align:start position:0%
different area and that it is an
 
05:54:14.170 --> 05:54:14.180 align:start position:0%
incredible burden for you to not only
 
05:54:16.490 --> 05:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
incorporate all this controversy but
 
05:54:20.030 --> 05:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
also to have to gear up in the entire
 
05:54:22.128 --> 05:54:22.138 align:start position:0%
background that a whole other committee
 
05:54:23.628 --> 05:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
has already
 
05:54:23.638 --> 05:54:24.948 align:start position:0%
has already
um

05:54:24.948 --> 05:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:28.310 --> 05:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
chained itself through their bills and
 
05:54:30.708 --> 05:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
in history of these boards and I might
 
05:54:33.590 --> 05:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
make a suggestion that if there be any
 
05:54:36.230 --> 05:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
of these sections between pertaining to
 
05:54:39.170 --> 05:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
licensure that are controversial and
 
05:54:41.330 --> 05:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
that there's there's this way in that to
 
05:54:43.368 --> 05:54:43.378 align:start position:0%
think about it that you might consider
 
05:54:46.070 --> 05:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
pulling them off anyway because we've
 
05:54:49.788 --> 05:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
already known that chairwoman Maguire is
 
05:54:52.910 --> 05:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
ready to incorporate much study in her
 
05:54:55.310 --> 05:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
committee and there's many people who
 
05:54:57.530 --> 05:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
are ready to do that work and as you
 
05:54:59.390 --> 05:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
know I'm one of those little worker bees
 
05:55:01.788 --> 05:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
who shows up and so I'd give that
 
05:55:05.270 --> 05:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
suggestion to you I also have a point an
 
05:55:05.280 --> 05:55:06.070 align:start position:0%
suggestion to you I also have a point an
answer

05:55:06.070 --> 05:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
answer
 
05:55:08.208 --> 05:55:08.218 align:start position:0%
representative leichmann you brought up
 
05:55:10.850 --> 05:55:10.860 align:start position:0%
several times the issue of having one
 
05:55:13.970 --> 05:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
person have too much Authority and that
 
05:55:16.330 --> 05:55:16.340 align:start position:0%
the board's not having that and such
 
05:55:19.730 --> 05:55:19.740 align:start position:0%
there are in the law currently at least
 
05:55:23.350 --> 05:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
in our board that many many
 
05:55:26.510 --> 05:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
rights and due process pieces that are
 
05:55:29.330 --> 05:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
in the law and these things will be
 
05:55:33.890 --> 05:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
incorporated into study that the adna
 
05:55:37.128 --> 05:55:37.138 align:start position:0%
will be doing in their retained Bill and
 
05:55:40.010 --> 05:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
so I I think that those are an important
 
05:55:42.230 --> 05:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
consideration is that
 
05:55:44.810 --> 05:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
the steps involved in the process of
 
05:55:47.030 --> 05:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
investigation and such that they are
 
05:55:49.788 --> 05:55:49.798 align:start position:0%
more fully articulated in the law and
 
05:55:51.770 --> 05:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
that they will be incorporated in that
 
05:55:51.780 --> 05:55:53.628 align:start position:0%
that they will be incorporated in that
study

05:55:53.628 --> 05:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
study
 
05:55:56.208 --> 05:55:56.218 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your comments uh
 
05:55:59.150 --> 05:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
and we appreciate your accolades back to
 
05:56:01.548 --> 05:56:01.558 align:start position:0%
us but I've got a very dedicated group
 
05:56:03.470 --> 05:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
of folks here and we'll hopefully make
 
05:56:06.350 --> 05:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
the best decision next week thank you so
 
05:56:06.360 --> 05:56:09.890 align:start position:0%
the best decision next week thank you so
much

05:56:09.890 --> 05:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:12.048 --> 05:56:12.058 align:start position:0%

should you remove us from deregulation I
 
05:57:24.288 --> 05:57:24.298 align:start position:0%
understand that there will be merging of
 
05:57:26.628 --> 05:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
boards we are not opposed to that
 
05:57:26.638 --> 05:57:27.910 align:start position:0%
boards we are not opposed to that
however

05:57:27.910 --> 05:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:57:32.030 --> 05:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
we ask that you look at putting us with
 
05:57:34.190 --> 05:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
Architects as I said in my statement on
 
05:57:38.330 --> 05:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
Monday we are Allied professions we the
 
05:57:40.910 --> 05:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
first two years of the five of each
 
05:57:43.190 --> 05:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
five-year program you are in the same
 
05:57:45.048 --> 05:57:45.058 align:start position:0%
classes with fundamentals and design and
 
05:57:47.570 --> 05:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
all of that and if you look at 38 States
 
05:57:50.570 --> 05:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
in um the country actually have a joint
 
05:57:52.368 --> 05:57:52.378 align:start position:0%
Board of Landscape Architects and
 
05:57:52.378 --> 05:57:54.110 align:start position:0%
Board of Landscape Architects and
architects

05:57:54.110 --> 05:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
architects
 
05:57:55.850 --> 05:57:55.860 align:start position:0%
um there's been a lot of talk of
 
05:57:58.548 --> 05:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
overlapping practice ours does overlap
 
05:58:00.650 --> 05:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
with um more with engineers and
 
05:58:03.288 --> 05:58:03.298 align:start position:0%
Architects and currently there's an
 
05:58:05.208 --> 05:58:05.218 align:start position:0%
organization called icor the
 
05:58:07.190 --> 05:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
international organization Council on
 
05:58:10.310 --> 05:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
regulations and there in the process of
 
05:58:12.770 --> 05:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
um coming up with an explanation of how
 
05:58:15.590 --> 05:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
we all overlap just for states to get a
 
05:58:18.110 --> 05:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
clearer view on that
 
05:58:18.120 --> 05:58:18.890 align:start position:0%
clearer view on that
um

05:58:18.890 --> 05:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:20.330 --> 05:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
and I guess I had one question
 
05:58:22.670 --> 05:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
personally I'm not speaking it for the
 
05:58:24.590 --> 05:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
ASLA at this point
 
05:58:27.288 --> 05:58:27.298 align:start position:0%
um but there was a lot of talk of
 
05:58:29.090 --> 05:58:29.100 align:start position:0%
um you could just go to another state to
 
05:58:32.510 --> 05:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
be licensed for instance if if licensure
 
05:58:34.250 --> 05:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
was deregulated
 
05:58:36.650 --> 05:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
and I went to Massachusetts I would be
 
05:58:38.030 --> 05:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
forced to take two more additional
 
05:58:41.330 --> 05:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
portions of the exam one it was totally
 
05:58:44.930 --> 05:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
based on their Wetlands process because
 
05:58:46.190 --> 05:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
they obviously want to know you their
 
05:58:48.310 --> 05:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
processing of Permitting
 
05:58:50.390 --> 05:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
so I guess
 
05:58:52.730 --> 05:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
it's very easy for folks to say they
 
05:58:54.948 --> 05:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
could just go somewhere else and come
 
05:58:56.930 --> 05:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
back and practice on another stage
 
05:58:58.490 --> 05:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
license but I do hope that you will
 
05:59:01.190 --> 05:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
remove us from deregulation
 
05:59:03.470 --> 05:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for your comments
 
05:59:05.448 --> 05:59:05.458 align:start position:0%
I actually used to hold a restricted use
 
05:59:08.690 --> 05:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
pesticide license so I know as far as
 
05:59:10.788 --> 05:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
the reciprocal Arrangements that exist
 
05:59:12.350 --> 05:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
between other states they're not always
 
05:59:14.810 --> 05:59:14.820 align:start position:0%
as easy as they sound thank you thank
 
05:59:17.930 --> 05:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
you yeah representative McGuire has a
 
05:59:19.970 --> 05:59:19.980 align:start position:0%
question if you take it sure yeah what
 
05:59:22.730 --> 05:59:22.740 align:start position:0%
are you licensed on any other state
 
05:59:24.590 --> 05:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
um I do have a main license because I
 
05:59:28.070 --> 05:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
briefly did some work there 20 years ago
 
05:59:30.170 --> 05:59:30.180 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to keep paying or you
 
05:59:33.128 --> 05:59:33.138 align:start position:0%
do I have just because I have it gotcha
 
05:59:36.490 --> 05:59:36.500 align:start position:0%
now as I understand that in Vermont
 
05:59:39.230 --> 05:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
there's a very simple ice there's an
 
05:59:42.548 --> 05:59:42.558 align:start position:0%
advisory type license right so there's
 
05:59:45.048 --> 05:59:45.058 align:start position:0%
there's no board there's nothing like
 
05:59:47.170 --> 05:59:47.180 align:start position:0%
that there's just two
 
05:59:50.868 --> 05:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
they appoint two Landscape Architects to
 
05:59:55.490 --> 05:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
to advise their version of oplc I'm not
 
05:59:58.548 --> 05:59:58.558 align:start position:0%
familiar with Vermont okay so all right
 
06:00:01.430 --> 06:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:04.190 --> 06:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:00:07.190 --> 06:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
all right so ah yes the Timberland
 
06:00:09.288 --> 06:00:09.298 align:start position:0%
Owners Association
 
06:00:12.890 --> 06:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
what might he be here to talk about
 
06:00:16.850 --> 06:00:16.860 align:start position:0%
oh I'll keep it under two minutes and I
 
06:00:18.470 --> 06:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
I thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
06:00:21.470 --> 06:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
and then your name please Jason stock
 
06:00:22.788 --> 06:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
06:00:24.650 --> 06:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
Timberland Owners Association we
 
06:00:27.288 --> 06:00:27.298 align:start position:0%
represent Timberland owners and Forest
 
06:00:29.750 --> 06:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
products industry and
 
06:00:29.760 --> 06:00:30.590 align:start position:0%
products industry and
um

06:00:30.590 --> 06:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:35.090 --> 06:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
I wanna I wanna thank uh chair Maguire
 
06:00:37.670 --> 06:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
for all the work she's done
 
06:00:42.048 --> 06:00:42.058 align:start position:0%
um and the her recommendation is to not
 
06:00:44.750 --> 06:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate Forester licensing for many
 
06:00:47.270 --> 06:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
Timberland owners Timberland is their
 
06:00:49.368 --> 06:00:49.378 align:start position:0%
biggest asset and having a professional
 
06:00:49.378 --> 06:00:51.230 align:start position:0%
biggest asset and having a professional
Forester

06:00:51.230 --> 06:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
Forester
 
06:00:53.390 --> 06:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
um someone with an accreditation behind
 
06:00:55.730 --> 06:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
them and you're entrusting this asset
 
06:00:57.350 --> 06:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
with them you want to make sure that
 
06:00:59.150 --> 06:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
there is some level of aptitude or
 
06:01:02.208 --> 06:01:02.218 align:start position:0%
accreditation there behind them and so
 
06:01:05.330 --> 06:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that acknowledgment
 
06:01:07.730 --> 06:01:07.740 align:start position:0%
um we're we are one of the combined
 
06:01:09.110 --> 06:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
board people
 
06:01:11.990 --> 06:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
um and I guess we're okay with that uh
 
06:01:14.690 --> 06:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
although we would prefer we like the
 
06:01:14.700 --> 06:01:15.530 align:start position:0%
although we would prefer we like the
current

06:01:15.530 --> 06:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
current
 
06:01:17.570 --> 06:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
current situation and we would prefer
 
06:01:19.970 --> 06:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
that but if if there isn't a if there is
 
06:01:21.368 --> 06:01:21.378 align:start position:0%
an effort to
 
06:01:24.948 --> 06:01:24.958 align:start position:0%
combine boards we're we're fine
 
06:01:27.590 --> 06:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
um with with what has been proposed our
 
06:01:29.090 --> 06:01:29.100 align:start position:0%
our only
 
06:01:31.910 --> 06:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
our only suggestion is right now under
 
06:01:33.948 --> 06:01:33.958 align:start position:0%
current law there are seven members on
 
06:01:36.590 --> 06:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
the forester's licensing board we would
 
06:01:41.110 --> 06:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
drop to two the current law 310 a
 
06:01:45.770 --> 06:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
colon 100 gets somewhat prescriptive we
 
06:01:48.590 --> 06:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
felt that talking to our members one of
 
06:01:50.390 --> 06:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
the feelings is that if you're going to
 
06:01:52.430 --> 06:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
have just two Foresters we would like to
 
06:01:55.250 --> 06:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
make sure that a that they are
 
06:01:58.128 --> 06:01:58.138 align:start position:0%
practicing you know they're actively in
 
06:02:00.110 --> 06:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
the woods practicing managing Timber
 
06:02:03.590 --> 06:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
sales that's an important aspect that
 
06:02:05.930 --> 06:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
there's someone actually out there and
 
06:02:09.470 --> 06:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
and doing that the other piece is we'd
 
06:02:12.350 --> 06:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
really like to see a Timberland owner on
 
06:02:13.850 --> 06:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
the board because that is truly the
 
06:02:15.650 --> 06:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
consumer that's the individual
 
06:02:18.770 --> 06:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
purchasing it right now the current
 
06:02:21.170 --> 06:02:21.180 align:start position:0%
board does require two kind of public
 
06:02:23.270 --> 06:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
members but they're they're landowners
 
06:02:25.310 --> 06:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
and we felt that having that landowner
 
06:02:27.910 --> 06:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
and having that perspective of someone
 
06:02:30.530 --> 06:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
on the board that understands Timber
 
06:02:33.288 --> 06:02:33.298 align:start position:0%
sales Timber transactions Etc
 
06:02:35.570 --> 06:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
lastly when it comes to adjudication and
 
06:02:37.010 --> 06:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
this gets to the discipline question
 
06:02:39.070 --> 06:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
that's been raised and and talked about
 
06:02:42.410 --> 06:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
we really feel that it's important that
 
06:02:44.868 --> 06:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
if you have a board
 
06:02:46.910 --> 06:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
um and our initial thought was have a
 
06:02:49.070 --> 06:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
board have say three members two
 
06:02:52.070 --> 06:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
Foresters and a landowner if there's an
 
06:02:54.288 --> 06:02:54.298 align:start position:0%
adjudicative matter that would fall to
 
06:02:56.390 --> 06:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
them it's kind of a jury of your peers
 
06:02:58.250 --> 06:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
and so that you're not in a position
 
06:03:00.770 --> 06:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
where you're asking a wetland or soil
 
06:03:04.070 --> 06:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
scientist to determine stumpage values
 
06:03:04.080 --> 06:03:06.288 align:start position:0%
scientist to determine stumpage values
doomage

06:03:06.288 --> 06:03:06.298 align:start position:0%
doomage
 
06:03:08.510 --> 06:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
um you know things of that nature so
 
06:03:11.270 --> 06:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
that you have professionals basically
 
06:03:14.390 --> 06:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
adjudicating their peers
 
06:03:17.448 --> 06:03:17.458 align:start position:0%
um and so with that again our our two
 
06:03:19.788 --> 06:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
comments for the for the proposal that
 
06:03:23.030 --> 06:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
has come over is a a in top first and
 
06:03:24.650 --> 06:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
foremost thank you for retaining the
 
06:03:27.048 --> 06:03:27.058 align:start position:0%
license B if you're going to have a
 
06:03:30.530 --> 06:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
board a combined board add have two
 
06:03:32.990 --> 06:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
Foresters at least ensure at least one
 
06:03:35.690 --> 06:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
of them is practicing forestry have a
 
06:03:37.970 --> 06:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
Timberland owner and the third comment
 
06:03:40.010 --> 06:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
is if there's when it comes to
 
06:03:43.128 --> 06:03:43.138 align:start position:0%
adjudicative matters have that subset of
 
06:03:46.368 --> 06:03:46.378 align:start position:0%
that combined board be the Arbiter and
 
06:03:48.530 --> 06:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
again there was talk about you know in
 
06:03:50.930 --> 06:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
consultation with the oplc or however
 
06:03:53.330 --> 06:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
you work that but that to me is the the
 
06:03:55.970 --> 06:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
key it's that's your jury of your peers
 
06:03:57.890 --> 06:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
I think I may have exceeded my two
 
06:04:00.110 --> 06:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
minute limit but I will conclude my
 
06:04:01.970 --> 06:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
comments at that and again I appreciate
 
06:04:04.270 --> 06:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak thank you Jason
 
06:04:06.470 --> 06:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative Dan McGuire has a
 
06:04:09.830 --> 06:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
question so um I'm not ready to give up
 
06:04:13.190 --> 06:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
on this one in the sense of elimination
 
06:04:16.070 --> 06:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this page we we got
 
06:04:18.170 --> 06:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
there's only one state west of the
 
06:04:20.628 --> 06:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
Mississippi that it licenses Foresters
 
06:04:20.638 --> 06:04:21.730 align:start position:0%
Mississippi that it licenses Foresters
California

06:04:21.730 --> 06:04:21.740 align:start position:0%
California
 
06:04:24.410 --> 06:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
uh the state of New York does not
 
06:04:27.288 --> 06:04:27.298 align:start position:0%
license Foresters
 
06:04:30.230 --> 06:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
um all of these states have have forests
 
06:04:32.750 --> 06:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
right I mean
 
06:04:34.850 --> 06:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
well not all of them but Oregon Oregon
 
06:04:37.670 --> 06:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
and Washington too but Nebraska doesn't
 
06:04:40.010 --> 06:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
have a lot of trees
 
06:04:43.250 --> 06:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
or Nevada so
 
06:04:45.890 --> 06:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
but again I think in New Hampshire with
 
06:04:48.288 --> 06:04:48.298 align:start position:0%
Forester licensing
 
06:04:52.190 --> 06:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
um and is it as chair chair mcquire had
 
06:04:53.750 --> 06:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
06:04:57.048 --> 06:04:57.058 align:start position:0%
this is woven into our tax policy this
 
06:05:00.410 --> 06:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
is woven into regulatory policy
 
06:05:02.448 --> 06:05:02.458 align:start position:0%
um current use and documented
 
06:05:05.330 --> 06:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
stewardship requires a plan that's
 
06:05:08.090 --> 06:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
approved by a licensed Forester in the
 
06:05:10.548 --> 06:05:10.558 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire there are other
 
06:05:12.708 --> 06:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
portions of Timber harvesting law that
 
06:05:15.410 --> 06:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
have have requirements for licensed
 
06:05:19.250 --> 06:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
Foresters and again as I had mentioned
 
06:05:21.948 --> 06:05:21.958 align:start position:0%
um you know our our association when we
 
06:05:23.868 --> 06:05:23.878 align:start position:0%
looked at this legislation and this
 
06:05:26.510 --> 06:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
proposal for us it was very clear that
 
06:05:27.770 --> 06:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
06:05:31.010 --> 06:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
this this is a part of consumer
 
06:05:32.448 --> 06:05:32.458 align:start position:0%
protection piece
 
06:05:35.150 --> 06:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
so that I can't I can't just come up to
 
06:05:36.770 --> 06:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
you and say yeah I've read some books on
 
06:05:38.948 --> 06:05:38.958 align:start position:0%
forestry and I feel compelled
 
06:05:43.548 --> 06:05:43.558 align:start position:0%
I feel uh I feel like I'm worthy of
 
06:05:47.448 --> 06:05:47.458 align:start position:0%
managing this asset of yours and so we
 
06:05:49.490 --> 06:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
felt that this was the set of very a
 
06:05:51.230 --> 06:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
good important consumer protection
 
06:05:56.628 --> 06:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:59.570 --> 06:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
all right Jason thank you thank you
 
06:06:02.448 --> 06:06:02.458 align:start position:0%
so again we will discuss this at our
 
06:06:05.448 --> 06:06:05.458 align:start position:0%
work session either on Monday or Tuesday
 
06:06:09.170 --> 06:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
of next week in room 212.
 
06:06:21.830 --> 06:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:21.840 --> 06:07:31.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:07:31.070 --> 06:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
