our day with a work session uh as
 
00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
previously scheduled on Senate Bill
 
00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
409 and uh representative Shapiro has
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
offered us an amendment number
 
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
1529h and representative Shapiro would
 
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr chair um this
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
amendment 1529h which I have yet to read
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
I just picked it up um simply adds an
 
00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:21.079 align:start position:0%
appropriation to the original bill for
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
$1 million which was the estimated
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
amount for the state
 
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
share of um increased Medicaid re
 
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.069 align:start position:0%
share of um increased Medicaid re
reimbursements

00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
reimbursements
 
00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
um in addition it says that the
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
appropriation will not take effect
 
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
until um the application for State
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid plan amendment is accepted by
 
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:49.720 align:start position:0%
CMS it does not address any of the other
 
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
questions that were brought up when we
 
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
originally discussed this bill about the
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
particular categories that would um
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
qualify servic is for reimbursement and
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
I assume that those will be discussed
 
00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:07.310 align:start position:0%
I assume that those will be discussed
here

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
Weber and I thought of putting in an
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
amendment that addresses items a through
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
F on lines 12 through 22 but I really
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
thought that it would be better for us
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
to discuss as a committee and see what
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
what direction the committee wanted to
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
go in before doing that but I would like
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
to uh address that at the appropriate
 
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
time and if the appropriate time is now
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
I'll go ahead but if not sure I've got
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
other things why not so the concern that
 
00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
I have in the drafting
 
00:12:45.079 --> 00:12:47.910 align:start position:0%
I have in the drafting
are

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.829 align:start position:0%
are
um

00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
the now let me just see if there's a
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
change there I do remember during the
 
00:12:58.509 --> 00:12:58.519 align:start position:0%
hearing you okay um there is a slight
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
change in the drafting with
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro's Amendment
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
because the bill as it came to us said
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
providers shall be eligible for Medicaid
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
reimbursement under this paragraph only
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
when all the following requirements are
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
met and in the amendment it says
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
providers shall be eligible for Medicaid
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement under this paragraph when
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
each of the following requirements are
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
met and I think that the that's really
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
just a different way of saying the same
 
00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
thing um the so I was wondering if we
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
could go
 
00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:39.959 align:start position:0%
through one by one would this be
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate and I could ask poll the
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
committee members who are here on what
 
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
what they think ought to be done with
 
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
each one because it seems to me
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
something like B the patient consents to
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
evaluation and treatment is an absolute
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
requirement um if the patient doesn't we
 
00:13:59.069 --> 00:13:59.079 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be I mean they shouldn't be
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
reading but that's a whole another thing
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh so that that one would be okay the
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
first one which is a is the response
 
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
originated through a 911 call and uh my
 
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there are other
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
ways of having the call originate other
 
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
than through
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
911 and I don't see why we would have
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
that limitation it didn't occur it was
 
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
not in the companion build that we had
 
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
from from the the house so I would love
 
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
to strike that one
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
entirely and this is just personal
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
preference on my account um number two
 
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
the patient consents to evaluation and
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
treatment and that has to be
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
mandatory um and then C D E and F seem
 
00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
to be to be one of those has to be
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
present but not all of them necessarily
 
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
have to be present but I'm more than
 
00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
willing if if other people have thoughts
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
on how that ought to go because and and
 
00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
the um bit about online 17 this shall
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
include when resuscitation efforts are
 
00:15:23.749 --> 00:15:23.759 align:start position:0%
terminated I think that ought to be in a
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
whole separate category because I don't
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
think it ought to be attached to one or
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
another but I do think yes reimbursement
 
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful okay any uh any other
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
on under for line 14 the patient
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
consents to evaluation and
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
treatment many patients are
 
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
unable to make that uh decision I I
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
don't like going back to my own
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
experience but I was in conquet hospital
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
for 3 days and don't even remember being
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
there never mind making any
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
agreements uh so that uh I don't know
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
what you do instead of that whether that
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
is a family member consents to evaluate
 
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
but there are many people who are
 
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
decision Mr representative Weber this
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
bill does not cover that situation that
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
situation when somebody is
 
00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
unresponsive is completely different
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
because if somebody is
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
unresponsive they are going to be
 
00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
transported um it's only when they can
 
00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.910 align:start position:0%
transported um it's only when they can
knowingly

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
um consent to treatment and knowingly
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
say I do not want to be transported so
 
00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:12.039 align:start position:0%
either first of all they have to
 
00:17:12.039 --> 00:17:13.870 align:start position:0%
either first of all they have to
have

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
capacity to consent to evaluation and
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
treatment and they have to have the
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
capacity to either agree there's no need
 
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.150 align:start position:0%
capacity to either agree there's no need
for

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
transportation actively refuse
 
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.549 align:start position:0%
transportation actively refuse
transportation

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
um deem that they're stable for referral
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
to The Physician or um and and I think
 
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
that E and F actually have to go
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
together the patient is stable for
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
referral to the patient's physician and
 
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
has the ability including mental
 
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
capacity and transportation resources to
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
obtain that assistance so I think that
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
those two actually go together but if a
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
patient is nonresponsive or simply does
 
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
not have the capacity to consent this
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't cover that situation
 
00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:06.919 align:start position:0%
and nothing would change for those
 
00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:10.390 align:start position:0%
and nothing would change for those
patients

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative McKay
 
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
yep representative
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chair first of all
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know how all got changed to each
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
so that wasn't requested but somebody
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
took that on to do that on their own um
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
I would I I essentially agree with
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weber's suggestion about
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
um making it one of the um C through f
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
um it does seem to me that in D the
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
patient does not request and actively
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
refuses um that it maybe it should say
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
the patient does not request or actively
 
00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.710 align:start position:0%
the patient does not request or actively
refuses

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
refuses
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
yep I'm sorry which line was that
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
representative in the amendment it's
 
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.870 align:start position:0%
representative in the amendment it's
line

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
18 the patient does not actively request
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
and strike out and and put in
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
or is my suggestion okay does not
 
00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.470 align:start position:0%
 
y

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
y
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
okay and so if I may the my suggestion
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
would be that after that change which I
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
agree with on D we would take E and F
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
and put them together so it would read
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
something in the nature of the patient
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
is stable for referral to the patient's
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
physician other community resources and
 
00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:41.799 align:start position:0%
I'm going to put the deceased bit in
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
with the bit about resusitation efforts
 
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
being terminated in
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
17 um and so e would be the patient is
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
stable for referral to The Physician
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
other community resources and the
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
patient has the ability including mental
 
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
capacity and transportation resources to
 
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
obtain assistance and medically
 
00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:08.799 align:start position:0%
medically indicated followup so that it
 
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
is clear that they are capable of
 
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
seeking the treatment they need
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
themselves um and I I would put those
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
two together and then I would put uh
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
resuscitation efforts are terminated or
 
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.669 align:start position:0%
resuscitation efforts are terminated or
is

00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
deceased I I would have to sit quietly
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
and find a sentence that works for that
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
but my point would be to to make that a
 
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
separate category so for
 
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
clarity and which which line is that
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
um in line 17 it says this shall include
 
00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
when resuscitation efforts are
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
terminated and in line 21 it says or is
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
deceased so I think those could be one
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
category yes it's clear that if your
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
resuscitation attempts are uh
 
00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.149 align:start position:0%
resuscitation attempts are uh
ineffective

00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
ineffective
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursed okay anyone
 
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
else represented mlan I have some
 
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
questions and I had to work last week so
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
I missed this and so I apologize um but
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
just from for my clarification since
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
we're taking the time it almost looks
 
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
like as I go through a through f
 
00:21:32.909 --> 00:21:32.919 align:start position:0%
the one flows from the other and so I
 
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
don't know that you want to have and
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
because it's almost like a sequence of
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
events first I have B and then I have C
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
and then I have you know what I'm saying
 
00:21:45.269 --> 00:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
and so if at
 
00:21:47.549 --> 00:21:47.559 align:start position:0%
anytime going through that sequence you
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
say no then it would
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
stop um and so I would think I almost
 
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
like the when each of the following
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
requirements is met so um just if you
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
can maybe talk a little bit as to why
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
you think the or would be
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
better Weber yeah I I started out with
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
that thought um and the concern started
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
with first of all if if you include
 
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
where resuscitation efforts are
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
terminated nobody's going to be
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
consenting or not consenting to anything
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
because they're going to be dead so that
 
00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919 align:start position:0%
was my first concern so if we take that
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
bit out um first of all um C is when the
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
EMT and the patient agree that there's
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
no need for
 
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.990 align:start position:0%
no need for
transportation

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
um and I don't see that as being the
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
same thing as D which is refusal of
 
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
Transportation because there might be a
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
need for transportation but the patient
 
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
might refuse it which would be the
 
00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.230 align:start position:0%
might refuse it which would be the
patient

00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
patient
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
right and the patient might refuse
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
Transportation um in which
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
case um the the issues about being
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
stable for referring to the physician
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
they might not be stable for referring
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
to a physician and they might not be
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
able to get to a physician but they
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
might still be refusing to be
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
transported so I I I don't see you can
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
say that all of those would necessarily
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
be present in every case although I
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
would agree with you that a lot of them
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
would be present in most cases so what
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
you're saying is as I go through the
 
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
chain of events if I stop at B and I do
 
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
not consent then CD andf are not going
 
00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
to happen that's right but the ambulance
 
00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:48.679 align:start position:0%
provider should still be
 
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:51.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursed yes right so okay if they've
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
rendered reimbursable Aid okay so you've
 
00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
answer that I I I'm I'm bored that makes
 
00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.990 align:start position:0%
answer that I I I'm I'm bored that makes
sense

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
um the the assessment in F though of I
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
like I suppose you could assess mental
 
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
capacity but how is a person going to be
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
assessing transportation resources is
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
that something that needs to be in there
 
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
um um I just don't know how I'm an EMT
 
00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
I'm coming on site and I'm assessing
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
whether or not you have adequate
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
transportation resources is that
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
so I if I may I'm assuming you ask the
 
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
patient and the patient either says yes
 
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
or no okay um and and again I think at
 
00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.630 align:start position:0%
or no okay um and and again I think at
that

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
point the patients will governs because
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
they they may have already said I just
 
00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
don't want to be transported um and
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
that's again why I think it should be
 
00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
one or the other not all of these um
 
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
because otherwise you might go down
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
through all of the different steps
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
and say oh but I don't have any
 
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
transportation therefore you may not get
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
paid and I'm not sure that those should
 
00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
be mutually exclusive and i' I'd be
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
um I I think the point about the
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
transportation is there for the
 
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
protection of the patient but I I I
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
might be persuaded to agree with you
 
00:25:29.389 --> 00:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
that that shouldn't be a bar to
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
payment IFC which is what this bill's
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
about I mean we want we want the patient
 
00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:36.919 align:start position:0%
to be getting the appropriate follow-up
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
care representative Shapiro did you have
 
00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
your hand up a second ago or oh I'm
 
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
sorry okay and then I just had one last
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
question on your comments I promise and
 
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
I had some other questions for later but
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
just one last on the on the 911 call um
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that if you don't call 911
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
but let's say you call an ambulance
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
directly or something
 
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.549 align:start position:0%
directly or something
um

00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
then uh you would you would just I
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
called them they're going to get paid
 
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
anyway because I called them is that not
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
already so so I I just want to explore a
 
00:26:15.679 --> 00:26:16.669 align:start position:0%
already so so I I just want to explore a
little

00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
little
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
bit because I'm thinking having a 911 if
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
I call them
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
directly I would be getting paid anyway
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
am I is that am I not correct on that
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
assumption um currently they're not
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
getting paid at all by
 
00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so even if I you know what I'm
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
not it doesn't matter how they get there
 
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid doesn't
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
pay if it's if they're not transported
 
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
okay so and I wish you might want to
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
actually talk to Senator Apprentice
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
about this because she knows a great
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
deal more about it being an actively
 
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
practicing EMT which is why she's so
 
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
specific about things that we were not
 
00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
specific in in our formulation but um my
 
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there is another
 
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
category of calls and it often occurs
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
for people
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
who uh either fall regularly or have
 
00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:12.039 align:start position:0%
other medical needs and and the call
 
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
comes through differently and I I am
 
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
sorry I just don't remember more about
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
that but I think I think the 911 call
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
requirement is one that in my ignorance
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
I find problematical because if the
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
service has been called out and if the
 
00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.310 align:start position:0%
service has been called out and if the
service

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
renders uh
 
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
assistance I think the service ought to
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
be paid but there may be a reason for
 
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
that being in there that I just don't
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
understand and I'm I'm more than willing
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
to be persuaded either way on it so
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
you're saying like a like a like you
 
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
know I need help and I fallen down and
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
you push the button and then they're
 
00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:00.200 align:start position:0%
calling so you're saying those kinds of
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
calls something like that I I just don't
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
know enough about it I would assume that
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
call would be going to a 911 call but I
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
gather that there are calls that don't
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
go through the 911 system and I'm there
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
there probably was a reason for putting
 
00:28:22.269 --> 00:28:22.279 align:start position:0%
it in and I I'd be glad if I drafted up
 
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
right and and my assumption without
 
00:28:50.669 --> 00:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
knowledge would be that if if they got
 
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
there and all that was needed was
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
somebody to be helped up because they'd
 
00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
Fallen uh that that wouldn't be
 
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
rendering medical treatment in any case
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't be um reimbursable so
 
00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel and probably have
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
more knowledge I don't have any
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
knowledge I have knowledge as a consumer
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
not as a as on the other side of this
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
but I I'm sorry I missed all this
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
discussion this is going to be a tad bit
 
00:29:16.919 --> 00:29:18.710 align:start position:0%
discussion this is going to be a tad bit
egocentric

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
egocentric
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
but we've been on the the visitors side
 
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
of ambulance services um and all I know
 
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
is my son got transported from one spot
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
to another and I got a $5,000 bill that
 
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
nobody paid for except me so I assume a
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
bill is being sent am I wrong and you
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
know maybe that Medicaid doesn't cover
 
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
it but somebody's responsible for that
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
bill representative Shapiro yeah I think
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
that for people who weren't at the
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
initial discussion about this this that
 
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
came up in in the in our other
 
00:29:54.909 --> 00:29:54.919 align:start position:0%
discussion but really this bill only
 
00:29:58.269 --> 00:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
talks to one issue which is when an
 
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
ambulance comes provides some treatment
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
and does not transport the person to the
 
00:30:05.789 --> 00:30:05.799 align:start position:0%
patient to the hospital for a variety of
 
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
reasons um currently Medicaid does not
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
reimburse for that service even though
 
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
they might they came out they provided
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
service they might have used materials
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
and this bill simply says that Medicaid
 
00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:21.519 align:start position:0%
will in the future reimburse it doesn't
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
really I know that it's a big issue
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
about people getting expensive bills um
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
either if they have private insurance or
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid but this bill does not really
 
00:30:33.509 --> 00:30:33.519 align:start position:0%
speak to that issue yeah I I guess my
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
question though is like well the bill is
 
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
still being sent to somebody
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
representative Weber why should I've
 
00:30:42.909 --> 00:30:42.919 align:start position:0%
heard two different I've heard two
 
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
different responses to that um one was
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
in our initial Hearing in which uh I
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
think my understanding was that if a
 
00:30:55.389 --> 00:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
Bill Gets Sent because the person is on
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
Medicaid they can't pay it and therefore
 
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
either the ambulance service if it is
 
00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
private or the town if it is public pays
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
for everything that's unreimbursed so
 
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
yeah it's getting reimbursed but it's
 
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
getting reimbursed either by at at the
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
expense of other services or it's being
 
00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
paid for by the
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers I also did hear somebody say
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
that it's not even sent and I don't know
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
whether that's because they're on
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or or not I just don't know uh
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
but the fact is
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
that the impetus behind the bill was the
 
00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:43.559 align:start position:0%
lack of reimbursement when if we amend
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
our plan Medicaid does reimburse these
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
Services if they're medically
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
necessary um and and it it doesn't
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
reimburse things like getting somebody
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
up after a fall you have to have
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
actually done an assessment of some kind
 
00:32:00.399 --> 00:32:01.590 align:start position:0%
actually done an assessment of some kind
representative

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
Missour thank you Mr chair so and maybe
 
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
this was already discussed at some point
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
too but the the list of requirements who
 
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
is authorizing that all those
 
00:32:15.549 --> 00:32:15.559 align:start position:0%
requirements are met so is there some
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
sort of sheet in the ambulance that
 
00:32:20.629 --> 00:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
someone is like checking off and then
 
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is then contacting them to make
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that all the requirements
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
are met representative Weber I don't
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
know for certain but I am pretty sure
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
that that's the way it would work
 
00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:34.039 align:start position:0%
because that's the way all reimbursement
 
00:32:35.629 --> 00:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
stuff I mean there's a huge amount of
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
red um um recordkeeping that is
 
00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:41.559 align:start position:0%
attendant on every single call wouldn't
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't that be in the bill though
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be mentioned somewhere
 
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
about who that and
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
authorization the person who is
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
submitting the bill would be responsible
 
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
for documenting all of those things I
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
mean there isn't anybody else there's
 
00:32:57.789 --> 00:32:57.799 align:start position:0%
the patient and there are the medic
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
medical responders so um attorney Barry
 
00:33:03.629 --> 00:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
do you want to weigh in on any of this
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
or attorney Barry I know are you with
 
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid unit or yeah okay thanks so
 
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
robberry general counsel for the
 
00:33:12.909 --> 00:33:12.919 align:start position:0%
division of Medicaid so I'm currently
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
actively exchanging texts with people
 
00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
trying to answer these questions in real
 
00:33:19.149 --> 00:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
time uh this is more of a billing
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
specialist question which is not my
 
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
specialty uh but I'm trying to get you
 
00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:24.919 align:start position:0%
an answer as we speak I'm also trying to
 
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
get an answer for the um the 911 call uh
 
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
language too to see if we can offer some
 
00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
uh alternative language that might
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
satisfy everybody so I will be back
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you um in
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
terms of um whether to put in the bill
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
or not how um the services tracked
 
00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
before you know so that there's evidence
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
that this happened I think it's just
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
standard it's just standard practice
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
when a medical provider is um billing
 
00:34:02.629 --> 00:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
private insurance or public insurance
 
00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:06.519 align:start position:0%
that they have to keep records which
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
indicate that the service was provided
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
that the service was medically necessary
 
00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
etc etc so the really the responsibility
 
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:18.919 align:start position:0%
is on them and if they were to um Bill
 
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or anybody else
 
00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
without you know incorrectly that would
 
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
be fraud or at least ineptitude in not
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
keeping proper record
 
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
so if we simply in answer to the
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
concern um online 11 say
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
something uh that uh providers shall be
 
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
eligible for Medicaid reimbursement
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
under their P paragraph when the
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
provider has documented that I mean does
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
that help you it it just seems to me
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
that there should be some sort it maybe
 
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to over complicate
 
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:01.720 align:start position:0%
things because that's not what I'm about
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
either but that there's no that we're
 
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
just kind of taking word for
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
it that you know are they just audibly
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
saying yes all these things were met I
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
mean cuz these are very specific
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
requirements you know so is someone
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
actually sitting in the ambulance like
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
check check check and yep these were and
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
some sort of paper trail that yes every
 
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
single one of these were met instead of
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
just a verbal yep we're good to go
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative would it be okay if I
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
just put in the words that they have to
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
document it and that that gives a
 
00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.550 align:start position:0%
document it and that that gives a
specific

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
requirement well I I mean I think that
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
would help personally that would you
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
know help but just CU this is kind of
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
open-ended to me it feels like there's
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
just this oo you know this is magically
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
happen when there's yeah I mean for me
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
the providers have a huge uge amount of
 
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
documentation that they already do and
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
um I agree with you that documenting
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
that these things have happened is
 
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
important so I'm just trying to find
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
what language you might be comfortable
 
00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
with that it would has been taken care
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
of Representative Nagel I think wants to
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
weigh in again I'm not sure where this
 
00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
bill is headed but I mean it certainly
 
00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:22.599 align:start position:0%
would be really helpful on documentation
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
issues to have feedback from the people
 
00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
that are doing it cuz I'll be honest you
 
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
know it's a night May and to answer your
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
earlyer comment I don't Bill Medicaid a
 
00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:35.079 align:start position:0%
lot because it's not worth it and I do a
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
lot of free care because it's not worth
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
it and I would imagine that there's
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
some something going on in here is they
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
don't bother either for the same reason
 
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
because the it's just the cost benefit
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
ratio is just not worth it
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
representative Shapero yeah I at least
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
from what we've heard or what I've heard
 
00:36:56.349 --> 00:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
from my constituents I don't think
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's accurate I think the people who
 
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
provide these services are really behind
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
asking for this it may be inadequate but
 
00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
um from their point of view inadequate
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
is a lot better than nothing so I don't
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
think it's just that people are not
 
00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.309 align:start position:0%
think it's just that people are not
billing

00:37:13.309 --> 00:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
billing
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
um um I was going to say one other thing
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
that seems to
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
have have escaped me so I'll I'll hold
 
00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
off on that
 
00:37:26.829 --> 00:37:26.839 align:start position:0%
one representative Weber I I too have
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
had extensive of discussions with my
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
local folks and and also the the county
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
folks and it's a number greater than
 
00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
zero and and they're very much in favor
 
00:37:40.109 --> 00:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
of it I I don't disagree with that at
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
all but I will tell you that in business
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
net revenue is the only thing and when
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
your cost exceeds any amount of Revenue
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
you get it makes virtually no sense to
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
bill at all and and and um you know you
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
do it on a case-by Case basis because I
 
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:54.839 align:start position:0%
know in some patients it's just not
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
worth it in other patients yeah the five
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
bucks over cost I'm going to gu worth it
 
00:38:02.589 --> 00:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
but but but can we
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
agree that your model is different from
 
00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
this representative Shapero yeah what I
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
was going to say is that
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
um you know in my career both when I
 
00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
worked at agencies I wasn't involved in
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
the billing but in the end of my career
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
when I was in private practice
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
um Medicaid was a low reimbursal but I
 
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
felt it was my moral responsibility to
 
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
take all insurances um and that
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
um so I build Medicaid a lot and um
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
being a small practice I did it all
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
myself and um you know there is a
 
00:38:56.309 --> 00:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic burden um and it is a low
 
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursal um um but it's helpful to the
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
people who are providing services to get
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
that reimbursement plus Medicaid rates
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
change all the time we just increased
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates and um I think it's very
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
clear when when billing Medicaid or
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
billing any insurance that there are
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
standards for documentation that have to
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
be met otherwise you are opening
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
yourself up to the liability of a
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
lawsuit um and if you're really just
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
bilding for things that um you didn't do
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
which we know happens that's fraud and
 
00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
that's really like a serious moral and
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
legal um
 
00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.510 align:start position:0%
legal um
liability

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
so I I I don't have any problem with
 
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
putting something in about adding
 
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
something about proper
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
documentation but I
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
think I don't know someone who's been
 
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
involved in that um part of billing and
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
providing Services I think there's many
 
00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
other um reinforcers that um we have to
 
00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
have proper documentation that Services
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
were provided and there was cause for
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
those services to be provided that they
 
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
were medically necessary I I don't think
 
00:40:16.119 --> 00:40:17.109 align:start position:0%
were medically necessary I I don't think
any

00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
provider worth their salt is that the
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
expression um would um function without
 
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.990 align:start position:0%
expression um would um function without
doing

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
that other comments representative mlan
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
then representative McKay well I think I
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
think the fact that we have a house bill
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
and a Senate bill and that the people
 
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
who are asking for the bill are actually
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
the people that provide the services
 
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
shows that they want to at least have
 
00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
the option of you know putting the bills
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
in because obviously I'm going to all
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
these calls I'm dedicating resources to
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
these calls I'm providing services but
 
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
they don't go to the hospital and I I
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
I've just committed you know a
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
significant amount of Labor um with
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
respect to the documentation side in my
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
personal opinion I think we should go
 
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
with a light hand because I think you
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
know it's not just that the people who
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
are providing the services that are
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to read this bill but also the
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
people who are doing the reimbursement
 
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
and so if they're if you know okay they
 
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
got to do a b c d um and if the provider
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
isn't giving me documented proof of that
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
then they're just not going to do it and
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if I want to on the
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
front end go to the providers and and
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
put that burden because I think Medicaid
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
and of itself is going to you know I'm
 
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
more concerned to be honest with you
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
that Medicaid might be over ambitious
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
and put too many hurdles in place so I
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
don't know that I want to put additional
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
hurdles up front I think I'll leave it
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
to them and we'll go from there that's
 
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:54.470 align:start position:0%
to them and we'll go from there that's
my

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you sure representative uh
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative McKay was next and then
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
then you go ahead thank you Mr chairman
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
I'm still trying to get at the role of
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
the patient in this process and whether
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
there's any role at all and maybe
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative wber can help me with
 
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
this um because it seems to me that the
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
patients themselves should have some say
 
00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
process representative Weber
 
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
the bill is very clear that the patient
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
has a lot to do with this first of all
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
the patient has to be responsive because
 
00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
the very first thing it says is the
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
patient has to consent to treatment and
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation if the patient doesn't is
 
00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:49.559 align:start position:0%
incapable of
 
00:42:53.309 --> 00:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
consenting this protocol doesn't apply
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
there are other protocols there are lots
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
of protocols but this one doesn't apply
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
um if the patient and the technician
 
00:43:05.309 --> 00:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
agree there's no need for transport
 
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
that's the patient's
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
participation if the patient actively
 
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
refuses to be transported that is the
 
00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.030 align:start position:0%
refuses to be transported that is the
patient's

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
patient's
 
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
participation and the last piece is uh
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
the provider's evaluation about the
 
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
patient having the capacity and the
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
ability to follow up if they need follow
 
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
up with their own Physicians
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
so all of
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
it is with the p patient permission and
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
participation the evaluation end of it
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
appears to me to be the medical
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
provider and that gets me to
 
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:54.079 align:start position:0%
representative mlan point which is
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
that's exactly why I liked the house
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
formulation much better because it was
 
00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
far less
 
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
specific um and
 
00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
simply provided a
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
blanket um authorization when the
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
treatment was medically
 
00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.670 align:start position:0%
treatment was medically
necessary

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
um I if if this is the bill that will
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
pass the senate or get concurrence from
 
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
the Senate I am more than happy to work
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
on this bill and get it to the point
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
where that can happen um I I but I like
 
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
the house bill better and and I don't
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
know how you feel about that I don't
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
want to put words in your mouth but uh
 
00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
your concern was a great deal of why I
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
like the house better if I could um that
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
that helps me very much thank
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
you uh I just wanted to point out the
 
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
the document that U Christina da just
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
distributed about um you know hopefully
 
00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
that'll clarify some of the questions we
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
have and and it's my understanding that
 
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
to qualify for the $1 million in
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
matching funds we just have to guarantee
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
some form of transportation is that
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
correct representative Shapiro you had
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
your hand up I'm sorry I'm I'm not
 
00:45:11.309 --> 00:45:11.319 align:start position:0%
understanding that statement because
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
transporting oh I
 
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.670 align:start position:0%
transporting oh I
see

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
Shapero and then representative Nagel
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
yes I have one
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
um one question and one request so my
 
00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:42.839 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
um I don't know whether this bill was
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
supposed to go to finance after our
 
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
committee initially it think so um but
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
it didn't have an appropriation and if
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
we pass this amendment now it will have
 
00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
an appropriation so I don't know how was
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
it already slated to go to finance I
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
think it's an early bill
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
right okay so that was my first question
 
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
the second question is we're spending a
 
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
lot of time which is good talking about
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
the details of this bill and making it
 
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
um making the details work in a more
 
00:46:16.829 --> 00:46:16.839 align:start position:0%
logical Manner and um hammering out
 
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
things like should documentation be in
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
it but I think obviously there's a whole
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
is amended or not amend ended or having
 
00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
the language straightened out or not the
 
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
people support the concept so I'm
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
wondering if before we before we end
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
this work session if we could perhaps
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
take a straw vote to see how people are
 
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
feeling about moving this bill forward
 
00:46:44.829 --> 00:46:44.839 align:start position:0%
where it's going to go to finance I
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
suspect um as we keep hearing from
 
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative wer any Appropriations in
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
the second year of the term um are
 
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:55.640 align:start position:0%
always problematic so that's going to be
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
another hurdle
 
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
could we take a straw vote like before
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
we finish the work session to see
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
whether people are supportive in general
 
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
so many people are missing it's going to
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
be representative
 
00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:13.720 align:start position:0%
Weber it's already the position of the
 
00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
house cuz we already passed the other
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
bill that we think these services are
 
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
necessary cuz we passed
 
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
it the issue I mean we can certainly
 
00:47:28.109 --> 00:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
take a straw poll I think the problem as
 
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
the chairman says is an awful lot of us
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
are not here uh so what what there is is
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the Senate and of course the Senate
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
could do what the Senate often does and
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
simply change our bill into their bill
 
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
and send it back to us for concurrence
 
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
or non-c
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
concurrence uh but
 
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
um you know my personal position
 
00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
is I will be working on drafting
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
something that takes in into account as
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
much as I have heard here to the best of
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
my ability for presentation to the house
 
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
in case this committee decides that it
 
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to move this forward
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
because I would have that as a minority
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
position but it sounds to me that like
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
all of us are relatively in favor of it
 
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
and we just see where it goes from there
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative sh well I guess that's
 
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
what I was looking for I mean all the
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
discussion has been about the mechanics
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill and um
 
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
it's just my curiosity to to see if
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
there's also sentiment I mean I support
 
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
this bill after it after it will be
 
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
further amended but I'm just wondering
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
how other people are feeling about that
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
I mean we could we could straighten out
 
00:48:45.069 --> 00:48:45.079 align:start position:0%
all the language and then some people
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
might just feel like yeah I don't want
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
to increase Medicaid services or we
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
don't have the money so I'm not going to
 
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
support this just curious going to be a
 
00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
concern for I'm just curious about how
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
people feeling about that I guess people
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
don't have to say but representative
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
Nagel I mean my comments the contrary I
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
think this is an absolutely wonderful
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
concept I mean I just spent a week in
 
00:49:10.349 --> 00:49:10.359 align:start position:0%
Kansas City discussing end of life care
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
and the importance of being at home um
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
we also know the worst place to be sick
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
was in the hospital so anything that we
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
can do to facilitate people remaining
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
safely in their own environment is
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
important and look changing the way we
 
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
look at ambulance service from a
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
transport service to somebody that
 
00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
allows you to stay safe in your home I
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
think there a great change shift in
 
00:49:35.789 --> 00:49:35.799 align:start position:0%
Paradigm and I think that this is is
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
helpful in moving us towards that and I
 
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
I I um I mean I struggled with a $5,000
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
bill personally which I was insulted by
 
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
so excuse my anger over that but I I
 
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
think that this is important and I think
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
that we really need to pursue this the
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
other flip side of it is you know
 
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is the worst insurer for
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
documentation and it's very frustrating
 
00:50:00.789 --> 00:50:00.799 align:start position:0%
for the amount of money you get for that
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to discuss that as
 
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:04.839 align:start position:0%
an offside thing but
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
um I we really don't want to overburden
 
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:09.559 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid documentation element of it
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
because it's already a big problem and
 
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
it does adversely affect your cost
 
00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:16.799 align:start position:0%
benefit ratio and um anyways
 
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
representative Weber so here's where I'm
 
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:21.640 align:start position:0%
coming from on the overall
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
thing um I read the bill that we got um
 
00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
initially in the house and I thought
 
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
this is a slam dunk everybody's going to
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
vote for this and on we go rejoicing and
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
I cannot believe the amount of
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
complication and everything else that's
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
going on here um is that the first time
 
00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.789 align:start position:0%
going on here um is that the first time
that's

00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:46.799 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
happened no no but but I I I fervently
 
00:50:53.309 --> 00:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
hoped I was right about this one but I
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't uh which is why I just I really
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
want to to put in as many of the
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
concerns that people have so that uh the
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
product that we have is a good work
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
product and I love this because we
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
actually have time to work on a bill
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
which we often don't um and so that's
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
that's item number one um item number
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
two is I'm not at all
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
sure uh while I understand the logical
 
00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
need for an appropriation
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
uh if we want to get this bill through
 
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
the house I'm not sure that agreeing to
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
put an appropriation in it is our best
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
strategy uh but then that's me trying to
 
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
second guess the finance committee which
 
00:51:47.549 --> 00:51:47.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:50.829 --> 00:51:50.839 align:start position:0%
suits I do have a question um I mean
 
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
this is slated for executive session
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
later today which depending on how the
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
hearings go we don't know how many bills
 
00:51:58.589 --> 00:51:58.599 align:start position:0%
we be get through uh is there something
 
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
you think you would have something ready
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
for by then or I would doubt it I mean I
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
I in terms of it it's going to take me a
 
00:52:08.589 --> 00:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
while to do the Drafting and I have
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
every minute between now and 3:00 booked
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that I can get an
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
acceptable product to OS and get it back
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
by three but we have next week so right
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
I I realize that the more that we clear
 
00:52:24.829 --> 00:52:24.839 align:start position:0%
today the better off your life is going
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
to be but all of us but especially me
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
yeah yes the clerk won't be haunting me
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
and and and M Miss di won't be haunting
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
me either or or M Davis representative
 
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
mlan know in light of some of the
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
comments you know of of Representative
 
00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
Nagel where we're trying to keep people
 
00:52:45.069 --> 00:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
at home and obviously they're providing
 
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
a service and they want to get build for
 
00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
it so I think the general consensus is
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
yeah this is this is a good thing and I
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
don't want people in Ambulance Service
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
routinely showing up and showing up and
 
00:52:59.390 --> 00:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
showing up and showing up providing a
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
service and not having the option to get
 
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
paid but then in in light of the
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
discussion that representative Missour
 
00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
brought forward now that I actually see
 
00:53:10.789 --> 00:53:10.799 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill I'm kind of wondering
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
maybe there is too much complexity with
 
00:53:17.069 --> 00:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill maybe in hindsight the
 
00:53:20.349 --> 00:53:20.359 align:start position:0%
house bill is a little bit better um and
 
00:53:23.789 --> 00:53:23.799 align:start position:0%
if there is some real will in the Senate
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
to go forward with this do we just put
 
00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
this one aside and let them deal with
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
the house bill and if they think the
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
house bill is too broad then they can
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
certainly like a representative Weber
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
said they can take the house bill and
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
turn it back into this bill
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
um uh and that way we
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
don't and I wish some of the other folks
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
in the committee were here so that we
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
could kind of flush it up but now that
 
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
we actually have the meat of the Senate
 
00:53:53.309 --> 00:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
bill in front of us H so that's my
 
00:53:53.319 --> 00:53:55.430 align:start position:0%
bill in front of us H so that's my
thought

00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:53:57.549 --> 00:53:57.559 align:start position:0%
maybe representative Weber and then
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro and and I would
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
be glad to discuss that with Senator
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
apprentice and and hear her thoughts on
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
that I I
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
think based on a discussion I already
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
had with her because of her knowledge of
 
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
the process she's a lot more comfortable
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
I think with this but i' I'd be more
 
00:54:22.109 --> 00:54:22.119 align:start position:0%
than willing to discuss that with her
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
and see if there is a strategy going
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
forward uh that having been said I
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
always think we're better off having a
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
house position of of any sort but I I
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
agree that getting this through the
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee is going to be a very
 
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
heavy lift at this point representative
 
00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
Shapero thank you Mr chairman um you
 
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
know when I first started six years ago
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
um I was very confused about why there
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
would often be the same bill from the
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
house and from the Senate and and this
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
one wasn't identical although it was on
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
the same subject but frequently they're
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
identical um and I've never gotten a
 
00:55:05.549 --> 00:55:05.559 align:start position:0%
good answer for whether that's
 
00:55:05.559 --> 00:55:07.150 align:start position:0%
good answer for whether that's
sloppiness

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
sloppiness
 
00:55:10.589 --> 00:55:10.599 align:start position:0%
strategy um gives it two chances but at
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
this point um from my experience with
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
the dental benefits bill which was
 
00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
similar there were two almost very
 
00:55:22.029 --> 00:55:22.039 align:start position:0%
similar bills not identical I think
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
we're best we have the best shot if we
 
00:55:27.789 --> 00:55:27.799 align:start position:0%
pursue we've already pursued the house
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
bill and if we pursue this one with our
 
00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
best efforts and um we'll see what
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
happens in the long run but I think
 
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
we're better off if we um move both of
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
them forward and
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
um you know only one will come and
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
become law if it becomes law so I I I
 
00:55:50.349 --> 00:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
don't think we should like let this one
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
go I think we should um do our best job
 
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
at it and move it forward and and also
 
00:55:59.029 --> 00:55:59.039 align:start position:0%
um you know while representative mlan
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
you said that um maybe this bill is too
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
complicated and the other one was
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
simpler and better
 
00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
um at the original hearing there were
 
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
people that said exactly the opposite
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
which is the house bill was too simple
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
and this one would flush out more
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
details and would be a a a a more
 
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:25.640 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and therefore a better um
 
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
means of getting this done so I
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
think you know there are different
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
points of view about that so I think we
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
should pursue both of them personally
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel I don't know if I
 
00:56:38.910 --> 00:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
had my hand up but I will say this this
 
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
is what confuses me a lot is that
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
um I mean Medicaid clearly articulates
 
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
expectations of me when I submit a bill
 
00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
that already exists and that's why I'm
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
really leaning back towards your point
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
that maybe the other bill was fine
 
00:56:58.589 --> 00:56:58.599 align:start position:0%
because everything we're talking about
 
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
here already exists in some way shape or
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
form the only difference is we're
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
legislating as opposed to they're
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
it other comments representative mlan I
 
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
mean I I'm just being cheeky but um
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
would it be almost worth it just to
 
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
amend this bill into the house bill so
 
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
um that's that's something I'm I'm sorry
 
00:57:26.589 --> 00:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
go ahead that's something that Senate
 
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
has done any number of times or they the
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
other thing that happens at Committee of
 
00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
conference time is that the bill that we
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
liked as the house or the bill that they
 
00:57:38.589 --> 00:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
liked as the Senate gets put onto the
 
00:57:41.309 --> 00:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
bill that's our top priority and comes
 
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
back um uh so there's a lot of game
 
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
playing at the end um
 
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
my preference and I I I had thought of
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
that as well I mean just amending it to
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
the house version
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.750 align:start position:0%
I think
that

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
the for me the best way to deal with it
 
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
is to turn the Senate version into the
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
best version of the Senate bill that we
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
can can pass if we can pass it maybe
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
maybe we can't pass it in which case
 
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
there is that bill still over there and
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
they can do what they want to do with it
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
and it will either come back or it won't
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:29.039 align:start position:0%
I I feel an obligation to take this
 
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
language which which has certain things
 
00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
in it that at least I object to and that
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
I've heard other people here objecting
 
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
to and try and straighten those out at
 
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
least as a starting point um
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
and I have to say that my own feeling on
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
it is that whichever bill will pass is
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
the one that I'm in favor of but um but
 
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
I can't tell which bill that is yet
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
King okay um I've been listening to a
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
lot of the going back and forth and um I
 
00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
I in my opinion I generally support
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
moving forward with the best language we
 
00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
can with this Senate bill just as you
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
had mentioned representative
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
Weber the um I think the the house
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
version we hit some snags because we
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
didn't like some of the language and we
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
wanted to do interm study and it went to
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
the house and it got through um and so I
 
00:59:36.589 --> 00:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
think we're seeing the same thing with
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
this bill I will say I I will not
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
support any money Appropriations for a
 
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:43.799 align:start position:0%
lot of the reasons that have been
 
00:59:46.589 --> 00:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
brought up and then my last comment
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
which is for future legislation is I
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
think somebody really needs to take and
 
00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
this might be addressed to some of the
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
people in the audience we really need to
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
take a look at the Medicare Gates that
 
01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
providers have to go through Medicaid
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
you mean Medicaid uh the the gates that
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
they have to go through in order to get
 
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
their money and so um I and this isn't
 
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
the first bill I heard this on so that's
 
01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:15.349 align:start position:0%
the first bill I heard this on so that's
my

01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
opinion representative Lan um thank you
 
01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and I'm sorry committee
 
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
members for just arriving I was over on
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
the Senate HHS committee um and that is
 
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
also why the prime sponsor the bill was
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
unable to come over so I did speak with
 
01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
her previously about this bill um I know
 
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
that one of the biggest challenges that
 
01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:34.599 align:start position:0%
some people in the house have vers with
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
this language is they were concerned
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
that this wouldn't Co and I'm sorry if
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
any of this was covered while I was away
 
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
um was that they were concerned that
 
01:00:44.109 --> 01:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't cover LIF assist but in a
 
01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
lift assist that isn't just a transfer
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
into the shower or into a car or
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
something else that is
 
01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
non-medical um when you find somebody on
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
the floor the first thing you need to do
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
before moving them is to assess them so
 
01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
through throughout that whole assessment
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
process even in a lift assist even in
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
somebody who has fallen and and is
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
unable to get up on their themselves
 
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
because they or their spouse is not able
 
01:01:08.029 --> 01:01:08.039 align:start position:0%
to get them um back up on their feet and
 
01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:09.559 align:start position:0%
safe there's still going to be an
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
assessment there's still going to be
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
that process so that would meet the
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
general criteria of this um I do agree
 
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
that we basically have language that
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
says that you need to meet all of the
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
requirements that are internally
 
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
conflicting and I think that it would be
 
01:01:27.789 --> 01:01:27.799 align:start position:0%
necessary to tease that out and figure
 
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
out sort of the categories I don't know
 
01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:31.240 align:start position:0%
if you already have that language done
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
could I just sure representative
 
01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:35.039 align:start position:0%
representative L on up to where we got
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
to I think so the just to deal with the
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
comments that we've had to date uh on
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
line 11 um there needs to be a little
 
01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
more specifity specificity and I haven't
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
drafted it yet but uh it says the
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
providers shall be eligible for Medicaid
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
when each when and we're going to take
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
out each of the following has been um
 
01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
satisfied because they're mutually
 
01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
exclusive but some language about when
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
the provider has documented the
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
following which makes it clear that the
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
provider has to do that although we
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
we're pretty sure that they already have
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
to but let's put it in there
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
anyway um
 
01:02:21.599 --> 01:02:23.750 align:start position:0%
anyway um
the

01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that still
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
unresolved is whether it has to be as a
 
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
result of a 911 call or not and I'd love
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
to talk to Senator Apprentice about that
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
but part of my thinking was to just
 
01:02:39.269 --> 01:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
strike that one because however they got
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
called out they get called out and if
 
01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
they have been called out and provided a
 
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
service I think they ought to be
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursed but there may be a reason for
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
that staying in that I don't know so
 
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's still a question mark uh it B it
 
01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
ought to it has to be absolutely
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
mandatory that the patient has consented
 
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
to evaluation and
 
01:03:00.599 --> 01:03:02.870 align:start position:0%
to evaluation and
treatment

01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.549 align:start position:0%
treatment
then

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.069 --> 01:03:11.079 align:start position:0%
sorry but if they are inable to consent
 
01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
to any of these things the whole thing
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
is just a completely different
 
01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.430 align:start position:0%
is just a completely different
protocol

01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
protocol
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
um the next thing is and then then I
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
would say and one of the following is
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
exists so either C would be after the
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation the paramedic and the patient
 
01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
agree there's not a need for
 
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
transportation I'm taking out this shall
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
include when when resuscitation efforts
 
01:03:41.069 --> 01:03:41.079 align:start position:0%
are terminated I'm making that into a
 
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:43.720 align:start position:0%
whole another category because one of
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
these things is not like the other the
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
second one would be the patient does not
 
01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:51.799 align:start position:0%
request or actively refuses and we said
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
or rather than and actively refuses
 
01:03:54.319 --> 01:03:56.269 align:start position:0%
or rather than and actively refuses
transport

01:03:56.269 --> 01:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
transport
 
01:03:59.789 --> 01:03:59.799 align:start position:0%
and then I put E and F together saying
 
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
the patient is stable for referring to
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
the physician or other community
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
resource I take out is
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
deceased and say the p and the patient
 
01:04:11.549 --> 01:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
has the ability including mental
 
01:04:14.109 --> 01:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
capacity and transportation resources to
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
obain obain the
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
followup and then i' put one final one
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
in that is resuscitation efforts were
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
terminated because the uh patient is
 
01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
deceased and and and that just sort of
 
01:04:32.109 --> 01:04:32.119 align:start position:0%
seems to untangle it a
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
bit um that seems to untangle almost all
 
01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
of it um except that you they may not be
 
01:04:39.269 --> 01:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
consenting to the evaluation and
 
01:04:40.829 --> 01:04:40.839 align:start position:0%
treatment if they're going to have
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful resusitation um efforts so
 
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
so CL so clarifying within that the
 
01:04:48.029 --> 01:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
patient consents to evaluation and
 
01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
treatment or um unless unless what the
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
new f is the case unless f is triggered
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
f representative Seth K thank you Mr
 
01:05:05.349 --> 01:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
chair um in regards to the response
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
originated through a 911 call I might be
 
01:05:11.269 --> 01:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
amenable to the idea of changing that to
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
an emergency call so it opens up it
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
opens up like if it was a Lifeline
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
button they pushed or something but I
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
would still like to keep that because um
 
01:05:22.269 --> 01:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
it it precludes the idea that the
 
01:05:24.269 --> 01:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
ambulance is on a on a fishing
 
01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
Expedition so well and I think I'm I'm
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
seeing some head moving over there and
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
he may want to comment because he
 
01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:33.799 align:start position:0%
actually knows what he's talking about I
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
think the other thing that people were
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
concerned about was making very clear
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
that this is not in the context of just
 
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
a routine transport so I think perhaps
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
something like the emergency call
 
01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.109 align:start position:0%
something like the emergency call
language

01:05:48.109 --> 01:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
might attorney Barry put that guideline
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
back in place so I had a brief
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
conversation with director lman um
 
01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
earlier while you guys as we're
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
deliberating and that's something we
 
01:05:59.710 --> 01:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
think we can do uh we don't have to
 
01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
actually have the 911 language in there
 
01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
but we would have to have some sort of
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
emergency language in there as well and
 
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to I've been writing down your
 
01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
uh your comments representative Weber
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to put together some draft
 
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
legislation to start with so you can
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
take a look at um if that's something
 
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
you're amendable to um either that or I
 
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
can do it and send it to you you want I
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
I representative
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
Shapero um while attorney Barry is here
 
01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
um before I before I had the um
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment um to add the appropriation
 
01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:38.839 align:start position:0%
now um I did reach out to um Mr Litman
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
and he seemed um to say that it was
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
important that we added the
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
appropriation now in this committee I'm
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
not really sure why to tell you the
 
01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:50.119 align:start position:0%
truth and I don't know that you would
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
have anything to add to that um but in
 
01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
regard to representative Weber's comment
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
about whether
 
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
to vote on this amendment now to add the
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation or just vote on the policy
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
and send it to finance for them to deal
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
with the appropriation um I was
 
01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
wondering the same thing and um Mr
 
01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
Litman seemed to think that it was
 
01:07:14.829 --> 01:07:14.839 align:start position:0%
better to do it first so I don't know if
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
you have anything to add to that well
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
the Department's position has been that
 
01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ability to implement
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
this legislation without an
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation and that's the sooner we
 
01:07:26.269 --> 01:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
can get it in there the the better
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and and I hate to
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
do this because it puts it off but one
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
of the ways of fixing it without an
 
01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation is to change the effective
 
01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
date to the next budget cycle well they
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
could still do that and they could still
 
01:07:42.029 --> 01:07:42.039 align:start position:0%
do that and that's why I'd rather not do
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
that here um but um that's the other fix
 
01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
that gets the language here puts the
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
department on notice that it has to go
 
01:07:54.269 --> 01:07:54.279 align:start position:0%
into your um budget as as submitted to
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
the governor as submitted to the house
 
01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.390 align:start position:0%
the governor as submitted to the house
but

01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%

01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%

am out of breath this is my third of
 
01:32:33.790 --> 01:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
fourth bills I'm introducing and that
 
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
I'm supposed to be in committee myself
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:38.510 align:start position:0%
representative Leon's been giving usone

01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
schedule uh further record my name is
 
01:32:42.189 --> 01:32:42.199 align:start position:0%
Becky Whitley I'm honored to represent
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
Senate District 15 which includes the
 
01:32:45.629 --> 01:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
wonderful communities of conquered bow
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
and hopkington today I'm honored to
 
01:32:50.109 --> 01:32:50.119 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill
 
01:32:53.070 --> 01:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
357 which should look very familiar to
 
01:32:55.629 --> 01:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
you from last last year this bill is
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
similar to hb610 from last session which
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
passed both bodies but died in Committee
 
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
of conference due to a different and
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
unrelated issue as happens often at the
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
end of the year so just generally the
 
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
bill expands the definition of Provider
 
01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
under the therapeutic cannabis program
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
to include a Prov a provider license to
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
prescribe medication and this is the the
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
piece that's a little different in the
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
Senate uh it was amended to um indicate
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
that this should be someone who is
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
primarily responsible for the patient
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
care so the bill also requires for
 
01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:34.119 align:start position:0%
issuance of a registry identification
 
01:33:36.189 --> 01:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
card to a minor certification from two
 
01:33:38.430 --> 01:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
providers one of whom shall provide
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
pediatric care I want to note that this
 
01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
policy was recommended by the
 
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
tcob the legislatively created body
 
01:33:48.109 --> 01:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
which provides medical oversight over
 
01:33:49.870 --> 01:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:33:53.109 --> 01:33:53.119 align:start position:0%
program um the the Senate uh supported
 
01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
this bill there was little to no
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
controversy after we did that minor
 
01:33:59.310 --> 01:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment which I believe strengthens
 
01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:02.360 align:start position:0%
the bill I do have an amendment that was
 
01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
requested by the Pas I'm not sure if the
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
committee received it we did get an
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
amendment okay great it is possible that
 
01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
there is a drafting error so I would um
 
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
ask for the committee's patience as we
 
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
sort out that potential drafting error
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
um but there are folks behind me that
 
01:34:23.550 --> 01:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
can speak to that Amendment and why it
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
is is
 
01:34:27.149 --> 01:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
necessary so with that I'm happy to take
 
01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
any questions we'll of course defer
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
technical questions to the folks behind
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
me thank you very very much for your
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
consideration of Senate Bill 357
 
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative blon um thank you Mr
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you senator for
 
01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
bringing this back I know that um we've
 
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
also made good forward prog progress on
 
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
bail reform so it's good to see that all
 
01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:46.360 align:start position:0%
the good parts from that Committee of
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
conference have moved forward um I I do
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
see that um in the drafting it's because
 
01:34:53.709 --> 01:34:53.719 align:start position:0%
it replaced section four which what
 
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
should be section five but I do
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate and like your language with a
 
01:34:58.950 --> 01:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
phys assistant so okay thank you very

01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
questions okay I'm seeing none thank you
 
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
okay and my apologies if I do have to
 
01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:14.840 align:start position:0%

01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%

01:36:13.950 --> 01:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
my name is Jerry kerk and I chair the
 
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
board um so the testimony is going
 
01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
around you'll have that to take a look
 
01:36:24.750 --> 01:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
at uh
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
now yes this is the same bill of 610
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
from 2023 it was a non- gerain amendment
 
01:36:31.950 --> 01:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
that killed that um 610 and then this
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up Bill uh was a bill that was
 
01:36:36.669 --> 01:36:36.679 align:start position:0%
filed at the request of the tcob which
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
voted unanimously to support it in case
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
you're not familiar with tcob it is the
 
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh committee which is statutorily board
 
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
statutorily charged with medical
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
oversight of the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
program So currently the only providers
 
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
who can certify patients to use
 
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis in New Hampshire
 
01:36:56.590 --> 01:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
are Physicians advanced practice
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
registered nurses and physician
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
assistants TCM o wishes to expand this
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
list to include other providers who may
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
be treating a patient and that's what is
 
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
done in section one of the bill when we
 
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
first talked about this and we discussed
 
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh we we kind of made a list of
 
01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
providers we thought that we should
 
01:37:17.629 --> 01:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
consider for expansion people like
 
01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
naturopaths dentists podiatrists and
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
then we ultimately decided that rather
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
than making a list which can always run
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
the risk of leaving somebody out
 
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately it would be easier and more
 
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
straightforward to allow any provider
 
01:37:30.669 --> 01:37:30.679 align:start position:0%
who's licensed to practice uh and
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
prescribe drugs to humans and possesses
 
01:37:34.830 --> 01:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
an active registration from the US Drug
 
01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Administration to prescribe
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
Controlled Substances to be allowed to
 
01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
certify a patient the reason we chose
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
that language is that's the language
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's already in statute for each of
 
01:37:46.189 --> 01:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
the provider groups currently allowed to
 
01:37:48.510 --> 01:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
certify patients now the amendment from
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate adds the language in lines 13
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
and 14 that stipulate that that
 
01:37:55.709 --> 01:37:55.719 align:start position:0%
qualifying provider must be primarily
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for the patient's care for
 
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
that qualifying condition that's
 
01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
certainly reasonable even if it's uh a
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
physician if you're seeing a physician
 
01:38:06.669 --> 01:38:06.679 align:start position:0%
uh who certifies you who wants to
 
01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
certify you a specialist uh they
 
01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
obviously shouldn't be special or
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
certifying you outside of their
 
01:38:13.229 --> 01:38:13.239 align:start position:0%
specialty and in this case for example a
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
dentist can meet the criteria to certify
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
a patient to treat dental pain uh if
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for treating that
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
but not to qualify to treat a patient
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
for treatment of let's say their foot
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
pain because they're not the provider
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
for that so the idea was to keep it in
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
the in the proper wheelhouse section two
 
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
is a revision to reflect the reality of
 
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
Medical Care in New Hampshire because of
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
the unique risks of therapeutic cannabis
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
in children guardrails exist in statute
 
01:38:41.229 --> 01:38:41.239 align:start position:0%
that a child being considered for
 
01:38:44.589 --> 01:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
certification has to be certified by two
 
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
providers and the current statutory
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
language mandates that one of those
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
providers must be a pediatrician however
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
in many areas around our the State
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
particularly in rural areas there may
 
01:38:57.709 --> 01:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
not be a pediatrician a child may have
 
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
as their PCP a family practice provider
 
01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
who provides pediatric care so we felt
 
01:39:04.589 --> 01:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
it would be best to have the child get
 
01:39:07.390 --> 01:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
their second certification by the PCP
 
01:39:09.589 --> 01:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
providing their Pediatric Care rather
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
than have to travel to see a
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
pediatrician who is not their provider
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
to be certified and the language in
 
01:39:20.350 --> 01:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
lines 14 to 18 allow that um now we do
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
not expect that the passage of this bill
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
will result in a large number of new
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
providers to begin certifying patients
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
but rather what it will do is ease the
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
burden on patients and reflect the
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
realities of our Health Care system so
 
01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
we'd like to ask you to please pass 357
 
01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
as amended in the senate in order to
 
01:39:40.990 --> 01:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
facilitate that certification I only saw
 
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
the new Amendment today and that's why I
 
01:39:46.030 --> 01:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
brought up to Senator Whitley that I
 
01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
think there is a drafting error because
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
what it in effect does again to
 
01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
understand initially it was medical
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
docks then it expanded to ARP aprns and
 
01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
then Physicians assistance were added a
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
few years ago the the amendment at is is
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
currently drafted strikes through the
 
01:40:08.830 --> 01:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
language in four which is what allowed
 
01:40:11.189 --> 01:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
physician assistance
 
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
to certify and it folds them
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
in uh to section three but section three
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
which then is physician PA and APRN that
 
01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
has to do with our adjacent states that
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
was put in to allow uh those who are
 
01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
certified under State Licensing Laws in
 
01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:33.719 align:start position:0%
Maine mass and Vermont and part of that
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
is because of the fact that people may
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
be cared for in an adjacent area for
 
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
example I live in Conway it's a Border
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
Town some people may get their um their
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
medical care over in fryberg which is
 
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
you know Stones throw away and their doc
 
01:40:50.229 --> 01:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
there might want to certify them but
 
01:40:52.030 --> 01:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be able to because they're
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
not in the right state so this was put
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
in to allow those adjacent State
 
01:40:59.430 --> 01:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
providers to be able to certify but the
 
01:41:02.109 --> 01:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
effect of this amendment as written will
 
01:41:03.870 --> 01:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
remove the ability of Pas in New
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be able to certify so we do
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
have to clean up the language on this
 
01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure what the rational was
 
01:41:12.270 --> 01:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
to put this in except perhaps to insert
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
physician assistant under uh three
 
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
because that was not there before it
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
used to be only Physicians and aprns in
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
the adjacent States could certify it was
 
01:41:24.669 --> 01:41:24.679 align:start position:0%
an oversight when we expanded it to Pas
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
a few years ago that should have been
 
01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
put in there so that's okay to add that
 
01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
but the the language in four should not
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
be stricken and it should stay as a as
 
01:41:36.149 --> 01:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
section five so I think it is a drafting
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
error and I Senator Whit and I can work
 
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately okay representative Leon uh
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:41:50.189 --> 01:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
honorable kerk for being here and
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
bringing this Insight um as I'm looking
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
at it closer I think I spoke a little
 
01:41:55.990 --> 01:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
too quickly saying that um it shouldn't
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
have struck that out um I guess the
 
01:41:59.589 --> 01:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
biggest thing is we seem to have an
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
emerging change in physic physician
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
assistants in their scope of practice so
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
the I think the question becomes if
 
01:42:07.629 --> 01:42:07.639 align:start position:0%
physician assistants need to be
 
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
practicing under supervising physician
 
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
still because if they do then we need to
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
have them operate we may need to have
 
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
them with the language in four unless we
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to open that up to them anyways
 
01:42:20.430 --> 01:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
and if we wanted to move the language
 
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
ahead and simply allow a physician
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
position I assistant or APRN to license
 
01:42:28.109 --> 01:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
to prescribe drugs then that clarifies
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
it um but I'm starting to wonder if
 
01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
we're still leaving too many segments in
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
here if we're looking at a physician
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
physician assistant advanced practice
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
registered nurse or and other New
 
01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire provider licensed to prescribe
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
drugs to humans and who presents this
 
01:42:45.070 --> 01:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if it all can actually
 
01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
consolidate into simply one paragraph
 
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
that takes into effect all of this and
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
I'm curious to'd be willing to try and
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
work on that we actually
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
kind of talked about that I mean this is
 
01:42:58.669 --> 01:42:58.679 align:start position:0%
just gradual creep uh and again it was
 
01:43:00.589 --> 01:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
initially written as medical providers
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
and then the APNs were added Pas were
 
01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
added and so each time we just added new
 
01:43:08.109 --> 01:43:08.119 align:start position:0%
section and they are rather equivalent
 
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
language in each one of them uh that is
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
that they can treat humans and so on and
 
01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
so forth except the PA language I know
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
there is a bill that is considering
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the supervision uh issue
 
01:43:20.990 --> 01:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
and if that passes of course then this
 
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
would have to be updated anyway but
 
01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
that's how come it has this cumbersome
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
structure and we did wonder about just
 
01:43:30.189 --> 01:43:30.199 align:start position:0%
going with the current language any New
 
01:43:32.109 --> 01:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire provider licens provide drugs
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
to humans and so on and so forth that
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
language that is currently in uh the
 
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
beginning of the bill or in lines 12 to
 
01:43:42.910 --> 01:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
16 of the of the amendment and I think
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
that could work because then that would
 
01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
cover all
 
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.669 align:start position:0%
cover all
providers

01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:43:49.950 --> 01:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
um and you still have to have this
 
01:43:52.030 --> 01:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
separate uh issue for
 
01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
the no actually sorry back up that would
 
01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719 align:start position:0%
that would muddy the water just a wee
 
01:43:59.589 --> 01:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
bit perhaps because
 
01:44:01.870 --> 01:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
um if you say it has to be the person
 
01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
primarily responsible for patient's care
 
01:44:04.750 --> 01:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
related to the qualifying medical
 
01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
condition all right so let's say your
 
01:44:08.669 --> 01:44:08.679 align:start position:0%
primary care doc wants to actually uh
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
certify you to use uh therapeutic
 
01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis for back pain and you're seeing
 
01:44:15.470 --> 01:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
a back specialist well that back
 
01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
specialist is really primarily
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
responsible for your back issue but your
 
01:44:20.669 --> 01:44:20.679 align:start position:0%
PCP should still be the one who is
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
allowed to do it so
 
01:44:26.669 --> 01:44:26.679 align:start position:0%
I you can see why we we debated this and
 
01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
we could never come up with a good
 
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
solution decided just to add one more
 
01:44:33.070 --> 01:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
one more section but I think it could
 
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
conceivably be scaled down to being the
 
01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:38.510 align:start position:0%
conceivably be scaled down to being the
language

01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:44:42.510 --> 01:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
um that uh let me get it up here the
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
language that currently exists one two
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:52.350 --> 01:44:52.360 align:start position:0%
into one but then you still want five
 
01:44:54.030 --> 01:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
separately because because that gets
 
01:44:57.070 --> 01:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
those other providers who are hate to
 
01:44:58.830 --> 01:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
say this but sort of peripheral
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
naturopaths dentists
 
01:45:04.510 --> 01:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
podiatrists um because again we're we're
 
01:45:07.629 --> 01:45:07.639 align:start position:0%
stipulating their the primary
 
01:45:10.109 --> 01:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility and that's not what it
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
says in the other ones so there are
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
wording issues here followup
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative L and as a followup I
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
think I now see why you settled on the
 
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
general language of the amend Amendment
 
01:45:22.990 --> 01:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
from Senator Whitley I think we should
 
01:45:24.910 --> 01:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
scan it for any other typos that are
 
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
actual typos and not content as I
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
misunderstood yeah I mean it needs to be
 
01:45:30.750 --> 01:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
looked over a little more closely and
 
01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:32.149 align:start position:0%
looked over a little more closely and
unfortunately

01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
our our administrator uh Michael Holt
 
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
who's the administrator is out on
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
medical leave right now and so I really
 
01:45:42.589 --> 01:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
can't even clarify this cleanly with him
 
01:45:44.189 --> 01:45:44.199 align:start position:0%
um but I can certainly speak with
 
01:45:45.589 --> 01:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley about this issue a
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more too again I just got I
 
01:45:50.109 --> 01:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
just got handed this an hour ago so I
 
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
was unaware representative Seth King
 
01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you uh
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
doctor for um taking
 
01:46:00.990 --> 01:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
questions the the ACT is relative to
 
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
expanding the definition of providers
 
01:46:05.709 --> 01:46:05.719 align:start position:0%
and I'm glad you spoke more about
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
section subsection five um because that
 
01:46:11.149 --> 01:46:11.159 align:start position:0%
last part there that you also touched on
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit um more recently who is
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
primarily responsible for the patient's
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
care related to his or her qualifying
 
01:46:18.910 --> 01:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
medical condition to me that just seems
 
01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
like it's in contradiction to the rest
 
01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
of the objective of the Bill of
 
01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
liberalizing things that to me seems
 
01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
like it would make things much more
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
conservative and it would put roadblocks
 
01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:33.719 align:start position:0%
in the way of patients being able to get
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
the care that they need because you know
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
yeah you might have a general
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
practitioner and you might even have a
 
01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
specialist for your back pain but Mo
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
both of them might be extremely
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
conservative and have very negative
 
01:46:46.030 --> 01:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
views of cannabis and they might not be
 
01:46:47.950 --> 01:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
willing to give you something so that's
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
where going to like a holistic doctor
 
01:46:53.550 --> 01:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
might be the option for you to get
 
01:46:55.149 --> 01:46:55.159 align:start position:0%
access to cannabis and to me I'm
 
01:46:57.229 --> 01:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
concerned that this would this would
 
01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
negate that ability and also you know I
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'm a firm believer that medicine you
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
can't just you can't
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
just dissect the anatomy of the body and
 
01:47:09.270 --> 01:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
say well this is a hand problem
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
therefore only hand doctors can help you
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
um the whole body is connected you know
 
01:47:16.589 --> 01:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
um what goes on in your gut health can
 
01:47:19.390 --> 01:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
affect your heart health it can affect
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
you know your brain I mean it can do a
 
01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:23.679 align:start position:0%
lot so so I don't know that section
 
01:47:25.709 --> 01:47:25.719 align:start position:0%
there that part I just feel like is very
 
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
concerning to me what are your thoughts
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
on that thank you well your comments are
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
very correct and indeed that language
 
01:47:34.589 --> 01:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
was not initially in it was added at the
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
behest of one of the Senators who wanted
 
01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
to have a little more restriction on it
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
and um we sort of accepted it uh I think
 
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
realize that the words primarily
 
01:47:49.149 --> 01:47:49.159 align:start position:0%
responsible is a little
 
01:47:52.030 --> 01:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
squishy um in the sense that it doesn't
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
say so responsible for example and you
 
01:47:57.310 --> 01:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
could argue that if you've gone to an
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
naturopath for treatment of a particular
 
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
disorder because you're not pleased with
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
how you're moving along with your uh
 
01:48:09.070 --> 01:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
standard uh medical provider you are
 
01:48:11.589 --> 01:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
actually asking that naturopath to take
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility for your care so then
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
that as I understand would be acceptable
 
01:48:21.390 --> 01:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
there was again I wish um my cult were
 
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
here because there was some conversation
 
01:48:26.189 --> 01:48:26.199 align:start position:0%
with opcc about oplc about that at one
 
01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:28.719 align:start position:0%
point and apparently that's they they do
 
01:48:30.910 --> 01:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
view it as somewhat squishy as well I
 
01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
hate to use the word squishy but it's
 
01:48:36.510 --> 01:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
kind of a true but um so I think it
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
could be okay and the idea was again
 
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
that we were getting to the fact that we
 
01:48:42.270 --> 01:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
didn't want the dentist to
 
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
certify for the foot pain that just
 
01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make a whole lot of sense
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
whereas your PCP I mean remember the
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
reason we have aprns Pas and medical
 
01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:53.310 align:start position:0%
reason we have aprns Pas and medical
provid

01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
provid
 
01:48:55.870 --> 01:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
they all could be your primary provider
 
01:48:58.030 --> 01:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh my primary provider is an APRN she
 
01:49:00.669 --> 01:49:00.679 align:start position:0%
not a medical doctor and so if she were
 
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
going to certify me the fact she's an
 
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
APN would not should not interfere with
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
her ability because she's my primary doc
 
01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
but if I were seeing somebody else about
 
01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
back pain let's say and they want to
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
desertify me uh they should be able to
 
01:49:16.350 --> 01:49:16.360 align:start position:0%
do that and if they're
 
01:49:18.990 --> 01:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
a orthopedic surgeon that is they're
 
01:49:21.149 --> 01:49:21.159 align:start position:0%
going to fit no problem if they're an
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
naturopath they just have to say yeah
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
I'm taking care of for your back pain
 
01:49:28.870 --> 01:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
and some naturopaths actually do care as
 
01:49:30.589 --> 01:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
primary providers for some people as
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
well I actually when this all came up I
 
01:49:35.229 --> 01:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
contacted one of our naturopaths in town
 
01:49:37.629 --> 01:49:37.639 align:start position:0%
to quickly check with her and she was
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable and also said that if
 
01:49:40.709 --> 01:49:40.719 align:start position:0%
somebody comes to see her for treatment
 
01:49:42.629 --> 01:49:42.639 align:start position:0%
she's viewing that she's primarily
 
01:49:44.589 --> 01:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
responsible she's not just a consult
 
01:49:46.830 --> 01:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
she's actually responsible for that
 
01:49:50.510 --> 01:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up um you mentioned the
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
possibility of say the dentist uh
 
01:49:55.870 --> 01:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
certifying for foot pain um is that is
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
that a problem we're actually seeing a
 
01:49:59.950 --> 01:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
lot of or is that this is solution in
 
01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
search of a problem that doesn't really
 
01:50:03.390 --> 01:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
exist thank you no we're not seeing it
 
01:50:05.229 --> 01:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
because they can't certify anyway
 
01:50:06.669 --> 01:50:06.679 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not uh they don't
 
01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:09.719 align:start position:0%
fit the criteria for certifying so we
 
01:50:11.229 --> 01:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
are not seeing something it doesn't
 
01:50:12.990 --> 01:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
occurred but we were trying to preempt
 
01:50:14.430 --> 01:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
somebody treating outside of their
 
01:50:16.709 --> 01:50:16.719 align:start position:0%
specialty you could with all the respect
 
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
assume that if somebody started doing
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
that their Board of registration might
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh do disciplinary action for practicing

thank you for having me you all have a
 
03:32:28.950 --> 03:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:31.429 --> 03:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
waitresses definitely I'm gonna keep
 
03:32:31.439 --> 03:32:35.830 align:start position:0%
waitresses definitely I'm gonna keep
going

03:32:35.830 --> 03:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:38.349 --> 03:32:38.359 align:start position:0%
anyway apologize that's okay
 
03:32:40.269 --> 03:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner Eddie Edwards um had me
 
03:32:41.830 --> 03:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
bring this bill forward as did the
 
03:32:44.670 --> 03:32:44.680 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs um they wanted to keep
 
03:32:46.469 --> 03:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
track we don't have any
 
03:32:49.389 --> 03:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
data right now on um so it's a data
 
03:32:51.189 --> 03:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
collection instrument it was much more
 
03:32:53.550 --> 03:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
broad originally but we've trimmed it
 
03:32:56.189 --> 03:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
down to just the third section because
 
03:32:58.469 --> 03:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
we don't know anything about violations
 
03:33:00.510 --> 03:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
discovered enforcement actions taken
 
03:33:02.110 --> 03:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
hearings that were held or corrective
 
03:33:04.790 --> 03:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
actions so we just want to have more
 
03:33:07.309 --> 03:33:07.319 align:start position:0%
data um on the therapeutic cannabis
 
03:33:10.150 --> 03:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
program containment rule violations so
 
03:33:11.750 --> 03:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's all the bill is doing now very
 
03:33:13.269 --> 03:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
limited in scope compared to its
 
03:33:15.990 --> 03:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
original intent
 
03:33:19.750 --> 03:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay any questions for Senator
 
03:33:21.910 --> 03:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
Ganon represent
 
03:33:23.950 --> 03:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
McLean thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:33:25.910 --> 03:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so it looks like
 
03:33:29.750 --> 03:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of um you're adding a lot
 
03:33:32.429 --> 03:33:32.439 align:start position:0%
of uh bear with me I just had one so
 
03:33:35.990 --> 03:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
sorry um so you're going after a lot of
 
03:33:39.309 --> 03:33:39.319 align:start position:0%
information out of the atc's um was
 
03:33:44.670 --> 03:33:44.680 align:start position:0%
there a a discrepancy or a concern or um
 
03:33:47.229 --> 03:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
something that just felt we had no data
 
03:33:50.189 --> 03:33:50.199 align:start position:0%
at all so originally I I I was much more
 
03:33:52.030 --> 03:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
ambitious with the police Chiefs
 
03:33:54.550 --> 03:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
originally in this bill and um I'm very
 
03:33:58.389 --> 03:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
concerned with Road use THC Road use not
 
03:34:01.309 --> 03:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
being able to you know measure it uh so
 
03:34:04.389 --> 03:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
I had other plans um there are states
 
03:34:06.790 --> 03:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
that have limits and I was going after
 
03:34:09.429 --> 03:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
another Avenue with the majority of the
 
03:34:12.070 --> 03:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
bill uh we decided it wasn't feasible
 
03:34:14.349 --> 03:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
and this worked good for commissioner
 
03:34:16.110 --> 03:34:16.120 align:start position:0%
Edwards to collect data that they feel
 
03:34:19.229 --> 03:34:19.239 align:start position:0%
is necessary on the
 
03:34:22.710 --> 03:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
dispensaries okay other
 
03:34:25.030 --> 03:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no other questions
 
03:34:26.150 --> 03:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator thank you very much
 
03:34:27.710 --> 03:34:27.720 align:start position:0%

03:34:42.239 --> 03:34:46.469 align:start position:0%
oh that that dry sense of humor can be
deadly

03:34:46.469 --> 03:34:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:47.830 --> 03:34:47.840 align:start position:0%

one okayy Abby Rogers from the
 
03:34:57.070 --> 03:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human
 
03:35:05.429 --> 03:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:07.950 --> 03:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
off good afternoon my name is Abby
 
03:35:09.670 --> 03:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
Rogers I'm the legislative leison for
 
03:35:12.070 --> 03:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
the division of Public Health Services I
 
03:35:13.790 --> 03:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
am representing the therapeutic cannabis
 
03:35:15.710 --> 03:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
program today which serves 14,000
 
03:35:17.990 --> 03:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
patients in the state um Mike Colt is
 
03:35:19.510 --> 03:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
generally the subject matter expert he
 
03:35:21.830 --> 03:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
is out today so I am taking his place to
 
03:35:24.229 --> 03:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
provide some information where I can on
 
03:35:27.110 --> 03:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
sb419 um generally we are not but we're
 
03:35:28.469 --> 03:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
not taking a position on the bill but I
 
03:35:30.070 --> 03:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to share that uh the department
 
03:35:31.990 --> 03:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
certainly is supportive of data
 
03:35:34.150 --> 03:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
transparency uh the information that is
 
03:35:36.670 --> 03:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
currently provided um or that is being
 
03:35:38.269 --> 03:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
proposed to be added to the annual
 
03:35:40.309 --> 03:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
report is currently required by
 
03:35:42.590 --> 03:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
administrative Rule and it is posted
 
03:35:45.150 --> 03:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
conspicuously in each ATC dispensary
 
03:35:47.150 --> 03:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
location so that program regist
 
03:35:50.469 --> 03:35:50.479 align:start position:0%
registrants have easy um current access
 
03:35:54.030 --> 03:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
to this important information um it is
 
03:35:56.030 --> 03:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
important to be transparent around the
 
03:35:58.790 --> 03:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
number of inspections uh conducted
 
03:36:01.189 --> 03:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
complaints received uh investigations
 
03:36:03.030 --> 03:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
conducted statements of findings issued
 
03:36:05.229 --> 03:36:05.239 align:start position:0%
plans of Correction received and
 
03:36:07.710 --> 03:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement a actions taken but is not a
 
03:36:10.030 --> 03:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
standard practice to make public in an
 
03:36:11.950 --> 03:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
annual data report the substance of
 
03:36:14.510 --> 03:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
those documents um our requirement for
 
03:36:16.429 --> 03:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
this type of information to be published
 
03:36:18.150 --> 03:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
in this manner would be inconsistent
 
03:36:20.750 --> 03:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
with other areas of the department uh
 
03:36:22.229 --> 03:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
where inspections are conducted for
 
03:36:24.110 --> 03:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
example food food protection health
 
03:36:27.870 --> 03:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
facility licensing Etc
 
03:36:31.070 --> 03:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
um and uh we feel like certainly all the
 
03:36:32.429 --> 03:36:32.439 align:start position:0%
information would certainly be available
 
03:36:34.469 --> 03:36:34.479 align:start position:0%
through a right to no request um and
 
03:36:36.990 --> 03:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
this is consistent with other health um
 
03:36:40.309 --> 03:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
facility licensing programs um I believe
 
03:36:42.790 --> 03:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
that Mr Hol has provided some uh
 
03:36:45.110 --> 03:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
Curative Amendment language proposal to
 
03:36:46.830 --> 03:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
um a member of the committee I think
 
03:36:49.309 --> 03:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
representative Lon potentially on how we
 
03:36:51.070 --> 03:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
might be able to address this in this
 
03:36:54.189 --> 03:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
bill um I don't see her here so um I can
 
03:36:56.750 --> 03:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
let you know her fill you in on that but
 
03:36:59.590 --> 03:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
um certainly we want to provide be as
 
03:37:01.469 --> 03:37:01.479 align:start position:0%
transparent as possible and I think that
 
03:37:03.550 --> 03:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
the Curative language would just um
 
03:37:05.189 --> 03:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
clarify the bottom half of the bill to
 
03:37:07.030 --> 03:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
be consistent with you know instead of
 
03:37:10.269 --> 03:37:10.279 align:start position:0%
saying um the statements of find like to
 
03:37:12.269 --> 03:37:12.279 align:start position:0%
require actual statements of findings it
 
03:37:14.150 --> 03:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
would be limited to like the number of
 
03:37:16.150 --> 03:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
statements of finding
 
03:37:18.469 --> 03:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
um but um I'm sure she can she can feel
 
03:37:22.429 --> 03:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
you here she is now perfect so amendment
 
03:37:24.229 --> 03:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
that Michael Hol may have offered you um
 
03:37:25.950 --> 03:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
yes um if it hasn't come in then it's
 
03:37:27.950 --> 03:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
down with Karen so I can go get that
 
03:37:29.870 --> 03:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
okay so I was just finishing up with our
 
03:37:32.510 --> 03:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
last right so I'm happy to take any
 
03:37:34.189 --> 03:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
questions if you have any for me any
 
03:37:37.150 --> 03:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
questions for M Rogers representative
 
03:37:39.150 --> 03:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
McLean thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:37:41.590 --> 03:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um have you
 
03:37:43.830 --> 03:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
had any uh contact with the folks at the
 
03:37:47.389 --> 03:37:47.399 align:start position:0%
atc's to get any feed Fe back um from
 
03:37:50.389 --> 03:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
them um are they basically in support of
 
03:37:51.790 --> 03:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
the admitted language that you're
 
03:37:53.790 --> 03:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
talking about or just do you have any
 
03:37:55.750 --> 03:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
insight with what their uh response is
 
03:37:57.990 --> 03:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
to that from your discussion uh I have
 
03:37:59.710 --> 03:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there was an amendment
 
03:38:01.790 --> 03:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
that Amendment language that was suppli
 
03:38:03.309 --> 03:38:03.319 align:start position:0%
uh provided to representative L but I
 
03:38:04.309 --> 03:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
believe there's a representative from
 
03:38:05.670 --> 03:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
the atcs here could probably speak to
 
03:38:07.269 --> 03:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
that better than
 
03:38:10.590 --> 03:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
me thank you you're welcome anyone else
 
03:38:12.750 --> 03:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions or
 
03:38:19.189 --> 03:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:21.469 --> 03:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
okay once again I I don't have any other
 
03:38:23.550 --> 03:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
uh print cards no one else has signed up
 
03:38:26.750 --> 03:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
to testify does anyone else wish to test
 
03:38:28.349 --> 03:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I was just going to
 
03:38:32.269 --> 03:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
say before you close I if there are is
 
03:38:34.910 --> 03:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
something going around we perhaps might
 
03:38:37.750 --> 03:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
need to say something about it okay
 
03:38:40.910 --> 03:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
before we end and and especially while
 
03:38:43.990 --> 03:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
the department is still here it would be
 
03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
nice to know that this is the language
 
03:38:48.750 --> 03:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
that they wanted because none of the
 
03:38:50.550 --> 03:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
rest of us have heard anything about it
 
03:38:52.269 --> 03:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
so okay no I was just wanted to make
 
03:38:54.189 --> 03:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
sure if anyone else was here to testify
 
03:38:57.830 --> 03:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
fing forward but um yeah the amendment
 
03:39:00.189 --> 03:39:00.199 align:start position:0%
is coming around I just didn't want to
 
03:39:13.590 --> 03:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:16.510 --> 03:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
sure are there any extra copies of the
 
03:39:22.950 --> 03:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:25.630 --> 03:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
anywhere Miss Dyer is getting one for
 
03:39:34.590 --> 03:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:36.950 --> 03:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay Miss Rogers do you have a copy of
 
03:39:39.269 --> 03:39:39.279 align:start position:0%
the amendment I do okay yes thank you it
 
03:39:41.389 --> 03:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
it have you had a chance to review it uh
 
03:39:44.950 --> 03:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
yes I have um and what it what it does
 
03:39:47.070 --> 03:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
uh provided by Mr Holt really keeps
 
03:39:48.990 --> 03:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
intact the the original section of the
 
03:39:52.340 --> 03:39:52.350 align:start position:0%
bill up until um I believe
 
03:39:52.350 --> 03:39:53.630 align:start position:0%
bill up until um I believe
[Music]

03:39:53.630 --> 03:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:39:57.429 --> 03:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
um it adds the word um the number and
 
03:39:59.990 --> 03:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
the number in front of what was the
 
03:40:01.389 --> 03:40:01.399 align:start position:0%
number of statements and the number of
 
03:40:03.510 --> 03:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment center plans for
 
03:40:04.950 --> 03:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
the original bill so it instead of
 
03:40:07.309 --> 03:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
having the statement of findings and and
 
03:40:09.030 --> 03:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
the the um alternative treatment center
 
03:40:11.110 --> 03:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
plans it adds it to more aggregate the
 
03:40:13.710 --> 03:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
number of um statements of findings and
 
03:40:15.110 --> 03:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
the number of alternative treatments
 
03:40:17.349 --> 03:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
that are plans of Correction which does
 
03:40:19.309 --> 03:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
correlate with use of that word the
 
03:40:22.750 --> 03:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
number in the previous part of the um
 
03:40:22.760 --> 03:40:24.830 align:start position:0%
number in the previous part of the um
the

03:40:24.830 --> 03:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:40:28.150 --> 03:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
bill representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
03:40:29.590 --> 03:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you so much for being
 
03:40:33.309 --> 03:40:33.319 align:start position:0%
here um and for standing in uh my my
 
03:40:35.830 --> 03:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
question is just to clarify um in the
 
03:40:37.070 --> 03:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
way the bill is originally written
 
03:40:38.550 --> 03:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
saying the statements of findings that
 
03:40:40.590 --> 03:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
were issued that would read that the
 
03:40:42.269 --> 03:40:42.279 align:start position:0%
entire statement of findings and the
 
03:40:44.110 --> 03:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
entire record would be something that's
 
03:40:46.150 --> 03:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
put into the into the record which is
 
03:40:47.670 --> 03:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
not done with any other industry would
 
03:40:49.870 --> 03:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
that be correct that's correct I did uh
 
03:40:50.830 --> 03:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you're in the room when
 
03:40:52.510 --> 03:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
I mentioned that that's not a practice
 
03:40:54.630 --> 03:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
generally that we do with in any HHS
 
03:40:57.030 --> 03:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
reporting including for food protection
 
03:40:59.269 --> 03:40:59.279 align:start position:0%
um and and other entries it it wouldn't
 
03:41:01.790 --> 03:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
just be a standard practice for us thank
 
03:41:01.800 --> 03:41:03.269 align:start position:0%
just be a standard practice for us thank
you

03:41:03.269 --> 03:41:03.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:41:06.630 --> 03:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:15.469 --> 03:41:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:17.429 --> 03:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak and I can't
 
03:41:18.990 --> 03:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
quite make out the last name but Matt
 
03:41:23.429 --> 03:41:23.439 align:start position:0%
from Green Leaf cannabis Matt Simon oh
 
03:41:25.670 --> 03:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not sure how you get Simon out
 
03:41:27.670 --> 03:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
of that but I've seen him a few times
 
03:41:29.790 --> 03:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
before so I know it's Matt Simon thank
 
03:41:32.670 --> 03:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I apologize for my poor
 
03:41:34.950 --> 03:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
penmanship wasn't planning to testify on
 
03:41:36.429 --> 03:41:36.439 align:start position:0%
this one just an observation not a
 
03:41:38.229 --> 03:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
criticism if you've seen my my
 
03:41:41.670 --> 03:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
penmanship I have no room to understood
 
03:41:43.349 --> 03:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
so for the record Matt Simon I work for
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
granite Leaf cannabis
 
03:41:48.349 --> 03:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have a position on this bill
 
03:41:49.870 --> 03:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
I I haven't seen the
 
03:41:52.670 --> 03:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
amendment uh overall I think the
 
03:41:54.469 --> 03:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
department is been very forthcoming
 
03:41:56.189 --> 03:41:56.199 align:start position:0%
anytime there's been a request for data
 
03:41:58.030 --> 03:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
the department publishes an annual data
 
03:41:59.950 --> 03:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
report and has been very responsive I
 
03:42:01.710 --> 03:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
think to legislators who have requested
 
03:42:05.309 --> 03:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
data but I see no objection to uh the
 
03:42:06.750 --> 03:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
concept of this bill and I'll trust you
 
03:42:09.070 --> 03:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
to get the details right thanks
 
03:42:10.790 --> 03:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
03:42:12.429 --> 03:42:12.439 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you for being here
 
03:42:14.670 --> 03:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
Mr Simon um do you think that it's
 
03:42:16.830 --> 03:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
important to make sure that the details
 
03:42:19.070 --> 03:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
of any particular investigation aren't
 
03:42:21.070 --> 03:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
all published publicly in a way that's
 
03:42:22.510 --> 03:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the rest of the way
 
03:42:24.950 --> 03:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
the the department operates I would
 
03:42:28.269 --> 03:42:28.279 align:start position:0%
agree with that thank you thank
 
03:42:30.590 --> 03:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
you other
 
03:42:32.870 --> 03:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:42:35.910 --> 03:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
Plaza I have a question to the chair
 
03:42:38.189 --> 03:42:38.199 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate to execute this
 
03:42:41.790 --> 03:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
bill today no no it we just U it's not
 
03:42:45.309 --> 03:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
not it's not noticed um and I I don't
 
03:42:47.469 --> 03:42:47.479 align:start position:0%
sense that we're ready to do that we
 
03:42:49.429 --> 03:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
take the permission of both sides to do
 
03:42:51.990 --> 03:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
that I'm not ready I'd like I'd like I'd
 
03:42:53.630 --> 03:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
just like to make sure to make sure I
 
03:42:55.590 --> 03:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
didn't have a typo in this um I had it
 
03:42:57.389 --> 03:42:57.399 align:start position:0%
sent over with language that was was
 
03:42:59.429 --> 03:42:59.439 align:start position:0%
from the department but I haven't done a
 
03:43:01.189 --> 03:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
specific side by side so if I have an
 
03:43:03.590 --> 03:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
and or an or or something that's wrong I
 
03:43:05.790 --> 03:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
don't want us to then have to clean up
 
03:43:08.429 --> 03:43:08.439 align:start position:0%
afterwards and I would
 
03:43:10.550 --> 03:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
defer okay
 
03:43:14.110 --> 03:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
sure I think we're close but I also get
 
03:43:15.590 --> 03:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
no sense that this one one is going to
 
03:43:17.510 --> 03:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
take us any length great length of time
 
03:43:19.149 --> 03:43:19.159 align:start position:0%
once we get to the end so I don't think
 
03:43:21.070 --> 03:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
so either and it's not an early bill
 
03:43:21.080 --> 03:43:22.309 align:start position:0%
so either and it's not an early bill
either

03:43:22.309 --> 03:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
either
 
03:43:27.630 --> 03:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
so okay any other questions thank you Mr
 
03:43:30.149 --> 03:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
Simon Okay does anyone else wish to
 
03:43:34.550 --> 03:43:34.560 align:start position:0%

04:01:50.550 --> 04:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
Senate introducing Senate Bill 505 on
 
04:01:52.309 --> 04:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
behalf of Senator Kevin avar the Bill's
 
04:01:55.309 --> 04:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor last year the legislature
 
04:01:58.830 --> 04:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
passed HB 611 which clarified that New
 
04:02:01.189 --> 04:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law did not authorize hemp
 
04:02:03.349 --> 04:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
derived products with a THC
 
04:02:05.590 --> 04:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
concentration greater than
 
04:02:08.670 --> 04:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
0.3% on a dry weight basis this was
 
04:02:11.269 --> 04:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
necessary to fix a gap in the 2018
 
04:02:14.030 --> 04:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
Federal farm bill which legalized hemp
 
04:02:16.830 --> 04:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
but was not intended to legalize THC
 
04:02:19.510 --> 04:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
products like Delta 8 THC had stepped
 
04:02:22.269 --> 04:02:22.279 align:start position:0%
through this loophole which HB 611
 
04:02:24.309 --> 04:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
closed but that bill contains a
 
04:02:26.189 --> 04:02:26.199 align:start position:0%
prospective repeal which would take
 
04:02:29.269 --> 04:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
effect in October Senate Bill 505 would
 
04:02:31.469 --> 04:02:31.479 align:start position:0%
repeal the repeal and keep the
 
04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
clarification of high concentration THC
 
04:02:36.349 --> 04:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
products in New Hampshire statute once
 
04:02:38.790 --> 04:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
again this bill has no change in current
 
04:02:40.830 --> 04:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law it keeps the current
 
04:02:43.149 --> 04:02:43.159 align:start position:0%
law on the books past the current sunset
 
04:02:45.389 --> 04:02:45.399 align:start position:0%
of October 2024 if you have any
 
04:02:46.510 --> 04:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
questions I'll be sure to get them to

it's a pretty straightforward bill um
 
04:04:08.349 --> 04:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
it's repealing a sunset um of a of a um
 
04:04:12.790 --> 04:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
law last year that was passed so um as
 
04:04:15.469 --> 04:04:15.479 align:start position:0%
you know new futures um we appreciate

the opportunity to testify we uh work on
 
04:04:22.830 --> 04:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
health policy issues um so one of the
 
04:04:25.469 --> 04:04:25.479 align:start position:0%
issues that we often work on are um
 
04:04:28.030 --> 04:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
alcohol and drug problems um we want to
 
04:04:30.229 --> 04:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
thank senator avard for sponsoring this
 
04:04:32.750 --> 04:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
important piece of legislation um this
 
04:04:34.429 --> 04:04:34.439 align:start position:0%
particular issue that you'll hear a lot
 
04:04:37.910 --> 04:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
about is these Delta 8 Delta 9 THC
 
04:04:40.269 --> 04:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
products they're often marketed as a
 
04:04:43.710 --> 04:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
less potent alternative to marijuana and
 
04:04:45.870 --> 04:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
are some of the faster growing product
 
04:04:48.149 --> 04:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
segments in cannabis Market due to a
 
04:04:51.189 --> 04:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
loophole in the federal hemp bill um
 
04:04:54.469 --> 04:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
delta8 or Delta 9s are sold as inhalable
 
04:04:56.910 --> 04:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
smokable inestable products including
 
04:05:00.870 --> 04:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
Edibles capsules oils tinctures and they
 
04:05:03.070 --> 04:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
are increasingly sold in convenience
 
04:05:04.950 --> 04:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
stores and gas stations right here in
 
04:05:07.750 --> 04:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire these products pose
 
04:05:11.349 --> 04:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
potential health risk both CDC and the
 
04:05:13.950 --> 04:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
uh FDA have issued warnings of ser ious
 
04:05:17.189 --> 04:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events um hemp derve THD
 
04:05:19.670 --> 04:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
products again they are unregulated and
 
04:05:21.550 --> 04:05:21.560 align:start position:0%
they often have brightly colored
 
04:05:24.550 --> 04:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
packaging that appeals to younger
 
04:05:27.630 --> 04:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
audiences and alarmingly these type of
 
04:05:29.910 --> 04:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh as I said are popping up more and
 
04:05:32.510 --> 04:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
more in uh convenience stores and gas
 
04:05:34.670 --> 04:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
stations in new New Hampshire with zero
 
04:05:36.149 --> 04:05:36.159 align:start position:0%
regulation I just want to be clear
 
04:05:38.469 --> 04:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
there's no regulation of these
 
04:05:40.830 --> 04:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
products last year new futurist worked
 
04:05:42.550 --> 04:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
with Partners in support of a bell that
 
04:05:44.910 --> 04:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
prohibited the sale of these products
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
containing the hemp derive products like
 
04:05:50.429 --> 04:05:50.439 align:start position:0%
Delta 8 Delta 9 Governor sonunu signed
 
04:05:52.469 --> 04:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
the bill into law however the law has a
 
04:05:54.670 --> 04:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
Sunset date of October
 
04:05:57.670 --> 04:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
2024 if the prohibition is not continued
 
04:06:00.110 --> 04:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
after this date we'll continue to see a
 
04:06:02.110 --> 04:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
proliferation of these unregulated
 
04:06:05.149 --> 04:06:05.159 align:start position:0%
products um to be sold here in New
 
04:06:09.309 --> 04:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so s sp505 to be very clear it
 
04:06:11.349 --> 04:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
looks to permanently ban these products
 
04:06:13.950 --> 04:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire shelves we ask you to
 
04:06:16.309 --> 04:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh vote ought to pass on this bill I
 
04:06:18.349 --> 04:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
have written testimony and then I have
 
04:06:19.990 --> 04:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
information about these products from
 
04:06:22.030 --> 04:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
the public health law Center this is not
 
04:06:24.750 --> 04:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
an issue unique to New Hampshire uh
 
04:06:28.189 --> 04:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
several states have um had to uh deal
 
04:06:30.269 --> 04:06:30.279 align:start position:0%
all states have been dealing with this
 
04:06:32.269 --> 04:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
um either through their maybe
 
04:06:35.469 --> 04:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
legalization bills or a separate um
 
04:06:37.149 --> 04:06:37.159 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation that would do
 
04:06:39.349 --> 04:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
prohibitions so I'll provide that
 
04:06:42.750 --> 04:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
information to you representative Lon uh
 
04:06:44.389 --> 04:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you so much
 
04:06:47.349 --> 04:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
for being here to testify on this um my
 
04:06:49.830 --> 04:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
I'll have a followup to this do you know
 
04:06:52.389 --> 04:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
um what hearings this had in the house
 
04:06:53.670 --> 04:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
or if it was only dealt with in the
 
04:06:57.149 --> 04:06:57.159 align:start position:0%
committee of conference so there was and
 
04:06:58.710 --> 04:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
when you brought this up I I tried to
 
04:07:01.229 --> 04:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
jog my memory so this was a separate
 
04:07:03.070 --> 04:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
bill in the
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
Senate um and then I believe it did have
 
04:07:11.510 --> 04:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
it did have a house Committee
 
04:07:14.070 --> 04:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
hearing um separately just on the bill
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
alone and I want to say it was maybe it
 
04:07:19.070 --> 04:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
was 611 maybe it was something else and
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
then through those confusing times a
 
04:07:23.389 --> 04:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
couple other amendments got added to it
 
04:07:27.750 --> 04:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
but there were uh hearings on the bill
 
04:07:29.710 --> 04:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
specifically that particular bill in
 
04:07:31.750 --> 04:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
both the Senate and the house okay and
 
04:07:33.510 --> 04:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
there a followup followup um thank you
 
04:07:35.189 --> 04:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
and are you aware that as part of the
 
04:07:37.030 --> 04:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
committee of conference um the reason it
 
04:07:39.309 --> 04:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
was included as a Sunset date was
 
04:07:40.429 --> 04:07:40.439 align:start position:0%
because the commission that was
 
04:07:42.030 --> 04:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
established by that same Committee of
 
04:07:44.469 --> 04:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
conference was charged with in including
 
04:07:46.670 --> 04:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
these derivatives along with their their
 
04:07:49.429 --> 04:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization model yes so you
 
04:07:51.630 --> 04:07:51.640 align:start position:0%
just drog my memory that was I believe
 
04:07:53.590 --> 04:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons unfortunately that
 
04:07:56.830 --> 04:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
didn't happen and I think the idea was
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
let's put this office part of our larger
 
04:08:02.030 --> 04:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory schedule that's why we can um
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
repeal it or let it sunset in October
 
04:08:06.670 --> 04:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
but it's not it hasn't happened yet I
 
04:08:08.229 --> 04:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
don't know if we'll have a larger
 
04:08:11.630 --> 04:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
regulatory Market by that time so our
 
04:08:14.349 --> 04:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
suggestion is to you know keep the
 
04:08:16.790 --> 04:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
prohibition get rid of the sunset and
 
04:08:19.469 --> 04:08:19.479 align:start position:0%
when we are ready to address it in a
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
larger regulatory manner then that can
 
04:08:24.510 --> 04:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
be in that bill alone but I just feel
 
04:08:28.670 --> 04:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
it's unsafe to say okay it sunsets let's
 
04:08:30.309 --> 04:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
try to get another bill in I mean what
 
04:08:32.309 --> 04:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
if there's a gap so I would just rather
 
04:08:34.229 --> 04:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
go with this keeping the probation on
 
04:08:39.870 --> 04:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:43.070 --> 04:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
off uh thank you uh Mr chair and thank
 
04:08:45.149 --> 04:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
you for the taking my question
 
04:08:48.950 --> 04:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
so uh my understanding from testimonies
 
04:08:53.469 --> 04:08:53.479 align:start position:0%
is that um those derivatives are being
 
04:08:57.670 --> 04:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh widely sold it means that it creates
 
04:09:02.590 --> 04:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue it creates uh uh work places uh
 
04:09:06.670 --> 04:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
it creates jobs so what negatives are we
 
04:09:09.710 --> 04:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
seeing from those derivatives that
 
04:09:12.870 --> 04:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
require us to kill those jobs people are
 
04:09:14.590 --> 04:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
getting very from these products they're
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
not regulated by the FDA and kids are
 
04:09:19.469 --> 04:09:19.479 align:start position:0%
getting their hands on them so that is
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
what the outcome is I can't speak to how
 
04:09:23.830 --> 04:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
much revenue these products bring in um
 
04:09:26.149 --> 04:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
even the alternative treatment centers
 
04:09:28.309 --> 04:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
are very wary of these products wouldn't
 
04:09:31.309 --> 04:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
want to sell them so I don't think that
 
04:09:35.670 --> 04:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
um certainly the revenue is um enough if
 
04:09:38.309 --> 04:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
anything's ever enough to take that over
 
04:09:41.229 --> 04:09:41.239 align:start position:0%
somebody's life or
 
04:09:45.510 --> 04:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:57.309 --> 04:09:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:59.990 --> 04:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
you do you have written testimony yeah
 
04:10:01.149 --> 04:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
okay great thank
 
04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Matt
 
04:10:07.790 --> 04:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
Simon from Granite Leaf um
 
04:10:10.109 --> 04:10:10.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis thank you for your thank you
 
04:10:10.119 --> 04:10:11.750 align:start position:0%
cannabis thank you for your thank you
for

04:10:11.750 --> 04:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:10:14.269 --> 04:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
the players spelling of your last name
 
04:10:15.510 --> 04:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
they do a better job writing it that
 
04:10:17.309 --> 04:10:17.319 align:start position:0%
time excellent excellent I would have
 
04:10:19.149 --> 04:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
remembered anyway but very good thank
 
04:10:21.630 --> 04:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman H again for the record
 
04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
Matt Simon Granite Leaf
 
04:10:26.269 --> 04:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
cannabis um
 
04:10:28.910 --> 04:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah I've been an advocate for
 
04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
legalizing natural cannabis THC products
 
04:10:36.189 --> 04:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
for more than 15 years so it puts me in
 
04:10:39.269 --> 04:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a strange situation to
 
04:10:42.670 --> 04:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
be supporting a bill like this uh but I
 
04:10:44.990 --> 04:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
do support for reasons I'm happy to
 
04:10:47.630 --> 04:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
explain uh THC
 
04:10:51.550 --> 04:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
products should be regulated and the
 
04:10:55.309 --> 04:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
proliferation of hemp derived synthetic
 
04:10:59.309 --> 04:10:59.319 align:start position:0%
THC products that have been coming out
 
04:11:01.790 --> 04:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
since this loophole was created by the
 
04:11:04.790 --> 04:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
by the farm bill a few years ago are not
 
04:11:08.269 --> 04:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
regulated uh so nobody really knows
 
04:11:11.149 --> 04:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
what's in them and as I mentioned these
 
04:11:14.269 --> 04:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
are actually synthetic products
 
04:11:16.750 --> 04:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh they are not natural cannabis
 
04:11:19.070 --> 04:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
products hemp companies are growing
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
fields of hemp they are harvesting the
 
04:11:24.630 --> 04:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
CBD from the hemp and then they are
 
04:11:28.469 --> 04:11:28.479 align:start position:0%
soaking the CBD in an acid that converts
 
04:11:32.429 --> 04:11:32.439 align:start position:0%
the CBD into whatever the desired THC
 
04:11:32.439 --> 04:11:33.830 align:start position:0%
the CBD into whatever the desired THC
variant

04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
variant
 
04:11:36.790 --> 04:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
is uh it turns out you can convert CBD
 
04:11:39.710 --> 04:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
into delta9 THC that's the one people
 
04:11:41.469 --> 04:11:41.479 align:start position:0%
who use cannabis are familiar with you
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
can also convert it into Delta 8 THC
 
04:11:45.070 --> 04:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
Delta 10
 
04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
THC THC acetate thcp THC JD and a whole
 
04:11:52.950 --> 04:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
bunch of other thc's that I'd never
 
04:11:55.149 --> 04:11:55.159 align:start position:0%
heard of until within the last year or
 
04:11:59.710 --> 04:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
two these novel THC isomer variant as
 
04:12:02.429 --> 04:12:02.439 align:start position:0%
they're referred to in in the law and
 
04:12:03.269 --> 04:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
and this
 
04:12:05.349 --> 04:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
bill most of them have never really been
 
04:12:07.750 --> 04:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
tested on humans some of them are
 
04:12:10.710 --> 04:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
reportedly far more potent than natural
 
04:12:15.910 --> 04:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
THC so THC for example I have a thcp
 
04:12:18.189 --> 04:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
vape right here I read on the internet
 
04:12:20.990 --> 04:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
that thcp is 30 times more potent than
 
04:12:23.910 --> 04:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
Delta 9 THC I don't know if it's true or
 
04:12:25.469 --> 04:12:25.479 align:start position:0%
not but I know I bought this in
 
04:12:28.109 --> 04:12:28.119 align:start position:0%
conquered and I wasn't carded to buy it
 
04:12:30.429 --> 04:12:30.439 align:start position:0%
and I would not inhale this product
 
04:12:33.189 --> 04:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
because I have no idea what it
 
04:12:37.149 --> 04:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
is uh there is more of a risk with Vape
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
products than other types of cannabis
 
04:12:41.870 --> 04:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
products that's why it's so important
 
04:12:43.790 --> 04:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
that cannabis Vapes
 
04:12:46.229 --> 04:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
be regulated any impurities any
 
04:12:48.309 --> 04:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
contaminants that are either on the
 
04:12:50.349 --> 04:12:50.359 align:start position:0%
Cannabis or in the oil that's created
 
04:12:53.269 --> 04:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
from the Cannabis or that are byproducts
 
04:12:55.710 --> 04:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
of the synthetic conversion
 
04:12:58.149 --> 04:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
process any of that will be concentrated
 
04:13:00.229 --> 04:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
into the oil that goes into the Vape
 
04:13:01.990 --> 04:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
cartridge and then it'll be inhaled by
 
04:13:04.670 --> 04:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
the consumer so for that
 
04:13:06.950 --> 04:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
reason we are very comfortable with the
 
04:13:08.750 --> 04:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
idea of having all of these products
 
04:13:10.670 --> 04:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
have to be independently lab tested
 
04:13:13.510 --> 04:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
everything we sell at the atcs has to be
 
04:13:17.070 --> 04:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
lab tested every single batch as the way
 
04:13:19.109 --> 04:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
we were able to assure patients that
 
04:13:22.990 --> 04:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
they're not inhaling dangerous chemicals
 
04:13:25.229 --> 04:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
uh there's simply no way for us to
 
04:13:26.510 --> 04:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
regulate these products they're being
 
04:13:28.870 --> 04:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
made in other states they're being sold
 
04:13:32.149 --> 04:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the federal law is a
 
04:13:34.670 --> 04:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
murky gray area our state law does not
 
04:13:38.109 --> 04:13:38.119 align:start position:0%
have to be a murky gray area I think the
 
04:13:40.950 --> 04:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
law that passed last year is a very good
 
04:13:43.750 --> 04:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
start I think it could be
 
04:13:46.550 --> 04:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps improved upon but the goal was
 
04:13:48.070 --> 04:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
just to make sure these products are not
 
04:13:50.429 --> 04:13:50.439 align:start position:0%
being sold in gas stations convenience
 
04:13:53.389 --> 04:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
stores places where kids can easily
 
04:13:55.990 --> 04:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
access them we can't stop people from
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
getting these products or using them I
 
04:14:00.030 --> 04:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want a criminal prohibition I
 
04:14:01.510 --> 04:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want people to be arrested for
 
04:14:03.710 --> 04:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
this you can order them online have them
 
04:14:06.389 --> 04:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
delivered to your house but do we want
 
04:14:07.750 --> 04:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
them in the convenience to our next to
 
04:14:10.109 --> 04:14:10.119 align:start position:0%
the high school and my concern is that
 
04:14:12.670 --> 04:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
any negative impacts that come from
 
04:14:14.830 --> 04:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
these synthetic
 
04:14:18.590 --> 04:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
THC drugs uh will end up reflecting
 
04:14:20.870 --> 04:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
negatively on cannabis so for example
 
04:14:20.880 --> 04:14:22.830 align:start position:0%
negatively on cannabis so for example
when

04:14:22.830 --> 04:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:14:26.389 --> 04:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
somebody Vapes some thcp and has a
 
04:14:27.870 --> 04:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
negative incident they'll call Poison
 
04:14:29.750 --> 04:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
Control or go to the emergency room and
 
04:14:31.950 --> 04:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
that'll end up being blamed on cannabis
 
04:14:34.750 --> 04:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
legalization when in reality it's an
 
04:14:37.149 --> 04:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
incredibly irresponsible policy federal
 
04:14:39.469 --> 04:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
policy that allows these products to be
 
04:14:43.229 --> 04:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
produced and distributed so again we
 
04:14:44.990 --> 04:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
can't fix federal law but I would urge
 
04:14:48.309 --> 04:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
you to pass this and repeal the repeal
 
04:14:49.630 --> 04:14:49.640 align:start position:0%
until such time as we're able to
 
04:14:51.750 --> 04:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
regulate regulate these
 
04:14:53.870 --> 04:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
products thank you questions
 
04:14:55.950 --> 04:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
representative Nan thank you Mr chairman
 
04:14:57.469 --> 04:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question I just
 
04:15:00.790 --> 04:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
have I'm confused um so it's illegal
 
04:15:03.149 --> 04:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
until like next week
 
04:15:06.070 --> 04:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
correct the the ban is until next week
 
04:15:07.630 --> 04:15:07.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter I believe it's the end
 
04:15:10.229 --> 04:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
of the year oh October but you bought
 
04:15:12.550 --> 04:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
that uh over a year ago I've been
 
04:15:14.870 --> 04:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
carrying this around for a while Sor
 
04:15:16.870 --> 04:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
confused thanks I believe the lior
 
04:15:18.309 --> 04:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
commission will tell you that there are
 
04:15:21.469 --> 04:15:21.479 align:start position:0%
still sales happening that there's the
 
04:15:22.950 --> 04:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
businesses are getting terrible legal
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
advice basically their lawyers are
 
04:15:25.990 --> 04:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
telling them these products are ferally
 
04:15:28.309 --> 04:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
legal all the products have disclaimers
 
04:15:31.990 --> 04:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
on them they say it's less than. 3% THC
 
04:15:34.469 --> 04:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
it's not uh you know this one for
 
04:15:37.710 --> 04:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
example is 92% Delta 8 THC but it claims
 
04:15:39.950 --> 04:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
to be fully compliant with the farm bill
 
04:15:42.630 --> 04:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
so you know that don't believe
 
04:15:44.510 --> 04:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
everything you read on a label of a
 
04:15:46.109 --> 04:15:46.119 align:start position:0%
product you're planning to inhale would
 
04:15:48.910 --> 04:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
be my advice to anybody by things that
 
04:15:52.229 --> 04:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
are produced and regulated systems and
 
04:15:53.910 --> 04:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh cannabis advocacy organizations like
 
04:15:56.469 --> 04:15:56.479 align:start position:0%
normal for example normal is the the
 
04:15:58.309 --> 04:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
organization that advocates for cannabis
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
consumers rights and they oppose these
 
04:16:04.750 --> 04:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
these products they think any product
 
04:16:06.510 --> 04:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
with THC in it should be regulated for
 
04:16:09.070 --> 04:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
the safety of consumers so I don't see
 
04:16:10.590 --> 04:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
this as a freedom issue I don't even see
 
04:16:12.429 --> 04:16:12.439 align:start position:0%
it as a cannabis issue I see it as more
 
04:16:15.750 --> 04:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
of an e of the synthetic drug debates
 
04:16:18.510 --> 04:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
that we've had previously in this in
 
04:16:21.710 --> 04:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
this body uh and this is just another
 
04:16:23.830 --> 04:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
synthetic work around people want
 
04:16:25.750 --> 04:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
natural cannabis and they're settling
 
04:16:27.550 --> 04:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
for this stuff because natural cannabis
 
04:16:29.790 --> 04:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
isn't legal yet
 
04:16:32.389 --> 04:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
thanks other
 
04:16:35.109 --> 04:16:35.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative McLean thank
 
04:16:36.349 --> 04:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:16:41.469 --> 04:16:41.479 align:start position:0%
question so um I'm just trying to so
 
04:16:43.469 --> 04:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
around us other states
 
04:16:44.710 --> 04:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
is is
 
04:16:47.389 --> 04:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
this are there similar bands in other
 
04:16:49.389 --> 04:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
states like Vermont Massachusetts around
 
04:16:54.070 --> 04:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
us and so uh since the ban has go in
 
04:16:57.149 --> 04:16:57.159 align:start position:0%
place if that's the case is there other
 
04:16:59.590 --> 04:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
places that uh people can go to I
 
04:17:01.349 --> 04:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
understand that that is not a regulated
 
04:17:02.750 --> 04:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
product but I'm assuming it's
 
04:17:06.149 --> 04:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
manufactured in a factory um
 
04:17:10.229 --> 04:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
so can you maybe talk to what is the the
 
04:17:11.750 --> 04:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
the fabric around us in terms of
 
04:17:14.630 --> 04:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
Regulation and also so the safety of
 
04:17:17.429 --> 04:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
that relative to maybe some Street Delta
 
04:17:21.910 --> 04:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
8 THC did you have any feel for
 
04:17:24.469 --> 04:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question so this
 
04:17:26.950 --> 04:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
is a very emerging area of policy states
 
04:17:28.189 --> 04:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
are scrambling to deal with it they're
 
04:17:30.030 --> 04:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with it in different ways
 
04:17:32.870 --> 04:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
Vermont expressly prohibited all uh hemp
 
04:17:35.910 --> 04:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
derive THC unless it is specifically
 
04:17:37.710 --> 04:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
approved by the the Cannabis control
 
04:17:39.830 --> 04:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
board so they invite company if you want
 
04:17:41.710 --> 04:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
to sell one of these products you just
 
04:17:43.790 --> 04:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
submit it to the for for approval and
 
04:17:45.429 --> 04:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
they they have to approve it and if they
 
04:17:46.910 --> 04:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
approve it you can sell it I don't know
 
04:17:48.389 --> 04:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
if they've approved anything or not but
 
04:17:50.630 --> 04:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's I think that is an incredibly
 
04:17:52.910 --> 04:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
responsible approach to regulating these
 
04:17:55.109 --> 04:17:55.119 align:start position:0%
products I think they need to be if
 
04:17:56.790 --> 04:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
we're if we're going to have seed to
 
04:17:58.710 --> 04:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
sale regulation of natural cannabis that
 
04:18:00.229 --> 04:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
these products should be held to at
 
04:18:02.269 --> 04:18:02.279 align:start position:0%
least that standard if not a much higher
 
04:18:03.710 --> 04:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
standard and in fact some of these
 
04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
specific products probably should never
 
04:18:07.510 --> 04:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
be legal I mean they're frankly they
 
04:18:11.070 --> 04:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
might be very dangerous we don't know uh
 
04:18:12.990 --> 04:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
when I see something's 30 times more
 
04:18:16.229 --> 04:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
potent than Delta 9 DHC I I get a little
 
04:18:16.239 --> 04:18:17.950 align:start position:0%
potent than Delta 9 DHC I I get a little
bit

04:18:17.950 --> 04:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
bit
 
04:18:21.349 --> 04:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
concerned well just just to kind of
 
04:18:24.429 --> 04:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
clarify so from a harm reduction
 
04:18:26.830 --> 04:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
perspective if I'm looking one of the
 
04:18:30.070 --> 04:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
selling points of legalizing cannabis is
 
04:18:32.870 --> 04:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to have nice safe not laced
 
04:18:35.710 --> 04:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
with fentanyl cannabis and so that's
 
04:18:37.990 --> 04:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's the push so what I'm trying to
 
04:18:39.990 --> 04:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
understand is that product there that
 
04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
you have on your desk relative to Street
 
04:18:45.269 --> 04:18:45.279 align:start position:0%
even though that's not regulated in the
 
04:18:48.389 --> 04:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
same way is there are they both the same
 
04:18:50.550 --> 04:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
in other words they're they're both is
 
04:18:54.030 --> 04:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
deadly or not as deadly or you have
 
04:18:55.469 --> 04:18:55.479 align:start position:0%
basically because it's so new you have
 
04:18:57.950 --> 04:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
no data I guess is the question from a
 
04:19:00.429 --> 04:19:00.439 align:start position:0%
harm reduction perspective the only way
 
04:19:03.429 --> 04:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
to know what is in this Vape cartridge
 
04:19:05.590 --> 04:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
is to have it tested by an independent
 
04:19:08.469 --> 04:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
lab and there has been uh there have
 
04:19:10.189 --> 04:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
been groups that have gone around buy
 
04:19:11.750 --> 04:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
buy a bunch of these take them to the
 
04:19:13.830 --> 04:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
independent lab have them tested the
 
04:19:16.429 --> 04:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
results are all over the place so some
 
04:19:18.109 --> 04:19:18.119 align:start position:0%
of the products are actually what they
 
04:19:21.109 --> 04:19:21.119 align:start position:0%
say they are and they don't contain
 
04:19:23.510 --> 04:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
terrible contaminants but an awful lot
 
04:19:26.630 --> 04:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
of them do have very dangerous
 
04:19:30.510 --> 04:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
contaminants very shocking levels uh and
 
04:19:32.950 --> 04:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
for that matter the the Delta 8 content
 
04:19:35.429 --> 04:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
is often labeled very inaccurately uh
 
04:19:37.670 --> 04:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
there's very often Delta 9 THC even
 
04:19:40.349 --> 04:19:40.359 align:start position:0%
though there's not supposed to be uh
 
04:19:41.950 --> 04:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
these are being produced in States like
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
Florida and
 
04:19:45.469 --> 04:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
where it's easy to get a license to be a
 
04:19:47.950 --> 04:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
hemp grower and it's easy to produce
 
04:19:49.149 --> 04:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
these products and there's no
 
04:19:51.670 --> 04:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
requirement for lab testing so they're
 
04:19:54.109 --> 04:19:54.119 align:start position:0%
complying with state laws and they're
 
04:19:55.790 --> 04:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
complying at least with their lawyers
 
04:19:58.910 --> 04:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
advice on what federal law is uh again
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
we can't fix that these aren't New
 
04:20:01.750 --> 04:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire companies making these
 
04:20:02.830 --> 04:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
products I don't know of any New
 
04:20:05.070 --> 04:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire company that's that's making
 
04:20:07.790 --> 04:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
these products but uh we have retailers
 
04:20:10.389 --> 04:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
who are in the position of companies are
 
04:20:12.269 --> 04:20:12.279 align:start position:0%
trying to say hey sell this sell this
 
04:20:16.030 --> 04:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's great it's legal and it isn't
 
04:20:18.030 --> 04:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
we need that Clarity in state law so
 
04:20:19.590 --> 04:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
that retailers know what they can and
 
04:20:22.590 --> 04:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
can't do thank you thank you
 
04:20:25.389 --> 04:20:25.399 align:start position:0%
representative Paz off thank you Mr
 
04:20:26.950 --> 04:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:20:30.590 --> 04:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
question so I I'm here in previous
 
04:20:32.830 --> 04:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
testimony in question I here about
 
04:20:35.309 --> 04:20:35.319 align:start position:0%
taking somebody's life and about deadly
 
04:20:39.109 --> 04:20:39.119 align:start position:0%
products so do we have any data how many
 
04:20:41.910 --> 04:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents are dead because
 
04:20:43.229 --> 04:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
of poison
 
04:20:48.670 --> 04:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
by this modified th THC derivatives or
 
04:20:50.590 --> 04:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
maybe National
 
04:20:53.149 --> 04:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
statistics yeah so there are statistics
 
04:20:55.870 --> 04:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
from other states I don't I I think it's
 
04:20:57.790 --> 04:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
very hard for somebody in poison control
 
04:20:59.750 --> 04:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
or somebody in an emergency room to know
 
04:21:01.149 --> 04:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
whether the product that somebody
 
04:21:02.990 --> 04:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
consumed was a natural cannabis product
 
04:21:05.830 --> 04:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
or a synthetic THC product a lot of
 
04:21:07.750 --> 04:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
people I talk to think these are natural
 
04:21:09.429 --> 04:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
products they're using them every day
 
04:21:11.070 --> 04:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
and they think it's a natural cannabis
 
04:21:13.109 --> 04:21:13.119 align:start position:0%
product it's not so
 
04:21:14.710 --> 04:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
I think it just gets reported at the
 
04:21:17.309 --> 04:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
emergency room as uh this person used
 
04:21:19.910 --> 04:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis or marijuana I think poison
 
04:21:21.670 --> 04:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
control is probably the same way so it's
 
04:21:24.590 --> 04:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
really hard to disambiguate uh that data
 
04:21:25.830 --> 04:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
but there have certainly been an
 
04:21:29.349 --> 04:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
increase in in calls to poison control
 
04:21:33.070 --> 04:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
and uh issues associated with these
 
04:21:36.349 --> 04:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
products uh Nationwide uh since since
 
04:21:38.429 --> 04:21:38.439 align:start position:0%
the farm bill and it's just hard to pin
 
04:21:41.269 --> 04:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
down how big that increase is because it
 
04:21:44.510 --> 04:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
coincides with can cannabis becoming
 
04:21:48.950 --> 04:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
more available as well other
 
04:21:51.109 --> 04:21:51.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:21:54.309 --> 04:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
Nel thank you Mr chairman thanks again I
 
04:21:56.269 --> 04:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
I we had this discussion earlier but I
 
04:21:58.109 --> 04:21:58.119 align:start position:0%
just feel obligated to point out the
 
04:22:00.510 --> 04:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
same problems occur with CBD in terms of
 
04:22:03.189 --> 04:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
marketing and verification and you know
 
04:22:05.710 --> 04:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
you already know that but I just feel it
 
04:22:07.550 --> 04:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a it's a big problem and we
 
04:22:09.750 --> 04:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
really need to be more responsible so I
 
04:22:10.670 --> 04:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
guess I'm not supposed to make a
 
04:22:12.990 --> 04:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
statement but I just did
 
04:22:14.790 --> 04:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
I would believe that representative Nel
 
04:22:14.800 --> 04:22:17.109 align:start position:0%
I would believe that representative Nel

Association of chiefs of police in
 
04:23:00.630 --> 04:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and I was totally
 
04:23:03.670 --> 04:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
cheating by asking to go last because I
 
04:23:05.910 --> 04:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
was hoping someone would be able to um
 
04:23:09.630 --> 04:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
explain this more clearly so the uh we
 
04:23:11.349 --> 04:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
would agree with the testimony from new
 
04:23:15.030 --> 04:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
Futures and with Matt um I simply want
 
04:23:17.269 --> 04:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
to hand in our testimony in support of
 
04:23:19.950 --> 04:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
the bill um what I've presented is our
 
04:23:22.269 --> 04:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
testimony also a couple of handouts
 
04:23:24.349 --> 04:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
based on what you've heard today uh
 
04:23:28.030 --> 04:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
things to know about Delta 8 um and also
 
04:23:32.070 --> 04:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
I did include um I included an article
 
04:23:34.030 --> 04:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
about increases in availability of
 
04:23:37.070 --> 04:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis products containing Delta 8 THC
 
04:23:39.870 --> 04:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
and reported cases of Adverse Events and
 
04:23:43.269 --> 04:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
I did include House Bill uh
 
04:23:45.790 --> 04:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
611 um I didn't have the Senate Bill
 
04:23:47.790 --> 04:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
representative lay on but I do have the
 
04:23:49.910 --> 04:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
house bill that is there so you can see
 
04:23:51.870 --> 04:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
where the there would be a prospective
 
04:23:55.309 --> 04:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
repeal this fall um and I guess also to
 
04:23:57.469 --> 04:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
answer the there is some data in here
 
04:24:00.070 --> 04:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
from our testimony from last year the
 
04:24:02.830 --> 04:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
FDA received 104 reports of Adverse
 
04:24:05.630 --> 04:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
Events in patients who consumed delta8
 
04:24:09.149 --> 04:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
THC products between December 1 2020 and
 
04:24:13.349 --> 04:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
February 28 2022 so a little bit ated of
 
04:24:17.429 --> 04:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
these 104 Adverse Events reports 77%
 
04:24:19.990 --> 04:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
involved adults 8% involved pediatric
 
04:24:22.389 --> 04:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
patients less than 18 years of age and
 
04:24:25.309 --> 04:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
15% did not report age and it went goes
 
04:24:27.590 --> 04:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
on to give some information about how
 
04:24:30.710 --> 04:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
many required intervention um Adverse
 
04:24:33.309 --> 04:24:33.319 align:start position:0%
Events just to continue to show how
 
04:24:35.510 --> 04:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
dangerous these products are included
 
04:24:37.990 --> 04:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
but we're not limited to hallucinations
 
04:24:41.109 --> 04:24:41.119 align:start position:0%
vomiting Trevor Tremor anxiety dizziness
 
04:24:43.030 --> 04:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
confusion and loss of
 
04:24:46.429 --> 04:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
Consciousness um and I think um that's
 
04:24:48.830 --> 04:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
it um we did explain a little bit about
 
04:24:51.389 --> 04:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
the farm bill of 2018 and the fourth
 
04:24:55.030 --> 04:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph as well so with that if I can
 
04:24:57.710 --> 04:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
answer a question I'd be happy to but
 
04:25:00.389 --> 04:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony representative Paz
 
04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
off thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:25:06.870 --> 04:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I wonder if some
 
04:25:10.229 --> 04:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
of the problems that we heard uh about
 
04:25:13.630 --> 04:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
could already be addressed with
 
04:25:17.469 --> 04:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
uh whether it's repealed or not because
 
04:25:21.630 --> 04:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding if the Delta 9 is uh
 
04:25:24.950 --> 04:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
regulated and if the if the label says
 
04:25:27.870 --> 04:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
it's delta8 but if there significant
 
04:25:31.109 --> 04:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
amount of Delta 9 it's probably already
 
04:25:33.670 --> 04:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
illegal to sell it and similar if there
 
04:25:36.670 --> 04:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
are some if it says Delta 8 but if there
 
04:25:39.550 --> 04:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
are some uh contamin
 
04:25:43.030 --> 04:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
contamination in the product that uh
 
04:25:46.229 --> 04:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
creates vomiting or some other uh
 
04:25:49.070 --> 04:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
adverse effects for the clients I think
 
04:25:51.870 --> 04:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
it would be already illegal to sell
 
04:25:54.870 --> 04:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
something with uh harmful
 
04:25:57.030 --> 04:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
contaminants well I think our testimony
 
04:25:59.030 --> 04:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
is that it's unregulated now and we're
 
04:26:00.750 --> 04:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
concerned for the safety of our citizens
 
04:26:03.469 --> 04:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
so we would for now want to keep the
 
04:26:08.670 --> 04:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
prohibition in place thank you other
 
04:26:11.070 --> 04:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lon uh thank
 
04:26:12.550 --> 04:26:12.560 align:start position:0%

04:26:13.990 --> 04:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
for being here thank you for including
 
04:26:16.830 --> 04:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
the final language of 6112 sure it's a
 
04:26:18.750 --> 04:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
good reminder of everything that came
 
04:26:21.070 --> 04:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
out of that Committee of conference yeah
 
04:26:23.389 --> 04:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
um do you know if there was a separate
 
04:26:25.590 --> 04:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
Senate bill or if it was only heard as
 
04:26:28.550 --> 04:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
part of an amendment to 6 when you ask
 
04:26:30.510 --> 04:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
Kate I'm sorry that I forgot to ask Mr
 
04:26:32.229 --> 04:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
Simon that I've been searching on the
 
04:26:33.710 --> 04:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
database to see if there was something
 
04:26:35.349 --> 04:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
for him I looked too I couldn't find it
 
04:26:37.109 --> 04:26:37.119 align:start position:0%
but I know there was it was Senate Bill
 
04:26:39.550 --> 04:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
180 oh 180 okay thank you I couldn't
 
04:26:40.750 --> 04:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
find out I didn't know if it had a
 
04:26:46.030 --> 04:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:46.040 --> 04:26:47.469 align:start position:0%
 
in

04:26:47.469 --> 04:26:47.479 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:26:52.870 --> 04:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
180 was it 2022 or 20 um if so last year
 
04:26:52.880 --> 04:26:54.910 align:start position:0%
180 was it 2022 or 20 um if so last year
so

04:26:54.910 --> 04:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:26:57.630 --> 04:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
2023 okay and this was signed into law
 
04:26:59.630 --> 04:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
yeah this is 20123 as well yeah I
 
04:27:02.269 --> 04:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
remember I I was on I Shar conference so
 
04:27:04.030 --> 04:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
I definitely remember that I just don't
 
04:27:05.630 --> 04:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
remember it having a hearing so thank
 
04:27:08.030 --> 04:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
you I will look into that because um it
 
04:27:09.590 --> 04:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
was a pretty big policy change which is
 
04:27:11.189 --> 04:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
why we sunsetted it but thank you very
 
04:27:12.910 --> 04:27:12.920 align:start position:0%

airplane

04:27:50.790 --> 04:27:50.800 align:start position:0%

04:28:05.710 --> 04:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:08.590 --> 04:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
moment sorry I naviga way Page I just
 
04:28:21.389 --> 04:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:23.670 --> 04:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
um online there were 23 in support and
 
04:28:26.910 --> 04:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
four opposed and um actually you mind if
 
04:28:28.149 --> 04:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
I just say one other thing from the
 
04:28:30.389 --> 04:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
committee of conference um so the reason
 
04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
that the Sunset date was on this was
 
04:28:34.389 --> 04:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
because the committee of conference took
 
04:28:36.309 --> 04:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
the one that expanded it from just from
 
04:28:37.510 --> 04:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
the pain so you wouldn't have to have
 
04:28:39.510 --> 04:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
spine surgery or try opioids before
 
04:28:41.910 --> 04:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
having cannabis as an option this had
 
04:28:44.149 --> 04:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
the commission there was charged with
 
04:28:46.750 --> 04:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
drafting legalization for cannabis
 
04:28:49.309 --> 04:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
legalization on it and that was supposed
 
04:28:51.870 --> 04:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
to include um regulations on hemp
 
04:28:54.229 --> 04:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
derived products and that's why as a
 
04:28:55.830 --> 04:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
good faith effort there was an intention
 
04:28:57.109 --> 04:28:57.119 align:start position:0%
that that was supposed to be included in
 
04:28:59.109 --> 04:28:59.119 align:start position:0%
the legal in the legislation for
 
04:29:00.870 --> 04:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
legalization and that was one of the
 
04:29:03.510 --> 04:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
charges to that commission so the fact
 
04:29:04.950 --> 04:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
that it's come separate and and there
 
04:29:06.870 --> 04:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't a bill filed um you know this
 
04:29:08.910 --> 04:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
really is I think intimately tied with
 
04:29:11.229 --> 04:29:11.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization because these
 
04:29:13.070 --> 04:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
really only exist because people don't
 
04:29:15.630 --> 04:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
have access to cannabis in the state so
 
04:29:18.389 --> 04:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
that's why there was a sunset so thank
 
04:29:20.710 --> 04:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
you okay with that I am going to close
 
04:29:24.870 --> 04:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on S SP 455 FN excuse
 
04:29:26.429 --> 04:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
me uh s
 
04:29:29.429 --> 04:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
sp505 and open the public hearing on S
 
04:29:33.349 --> 04:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
SP 455 two minutes two minutes oh well
 
04:29:35.870 --> 04:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
it's 202 there I thought so it's like 1
 
04:29:38.990 --> 04:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
minute by Apple okay all right we'll be
 
04:29:45.070 --> 04:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:46.389 --> 04:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
need to have we'll need to have
 
04:29:47.950 --> 04:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
facilities fix that
 
04:29:52.189 --> 04:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
clock I once nipped up to fix the clock
 
04:29:54.710 --> 04:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
and leapt up on a chair and tried to
 
04:29:56.630 --> 04:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
pull it down so I could fix it realized
 
04:29:59.229 --> 04:29:59.239 align:start position:0%
it was hardwired into the electric wire
 
04:30:01.630 --> 04:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
and I very nearly ripped the live wires
 
04:30:04.910 --> 04:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
out of the back of the clock so I don't
 
04:30:08.309 --> 04:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
touch anything like that anymore sorry
 
04:30:10.269 --> 04:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
for my freak out earlier I don't know is
 
04:30:15.910 --> 04:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:18.790 --> 04:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
it it was a fairly loud noise and it was
 
04:30:20.790 --> 04:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
in fact in my younger days I used to go
 
04:30:22.790 --> 04:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
to conventions and a standard part of
 
04:30:24.389 --> 04:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
the convention was that somebody was out
 
04:30:26.990 --> 04:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
of the fire alarm so I I learned to just
 
04:30:28.750 --> 04:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
sleep for those things Unfortunately
 
04:30:31.309 --> 04:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
they were all always bogus uh if that
 
04:30:38.670 --> 04:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:41.109 --> 04:30:41.119 align:start position:0%
up and it's an interesting point I mean
 
04:30:44.109 --> 04:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
we used to do drills evacuating this
 
04:30:45.990 --> 04:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
building and the other thing is that
 
04:30:49.149 --> 04:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
there are certain rooms that are shelter
 
04:30:51.229 --> 04:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
in place rooms for people with no
 
04:30:53.550 --> 04:30:53.560 align:start position:0%
mobility issues and we don't we haven't
 
04:30:55.590 --> 04:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
talked about that for a number of years
 
04:30:57.469 --> 04:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
now yeah I've been here this is my
 
04:30:58.790 --> 04:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
fourth year I've never had we've never
 
04:31:00.630 --> 04:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
had a fire drill since I've been here
 
04:31:02.790 --> 04:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
well representative salaway is no longer
 
04:31:04.429 --> 04:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
on this committee because he would have
 
04:31:07.429 --> 04:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
insisted on one but uh it it was
 
04:31:08.990 --> 04:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
actually mentioned to the speaker
 
04:31:12.030 --> 04:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
recently as as something that perhaps we
 
04:31:13.870 --> 04:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
be going back to
 
04:31:18.149 --> 04:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
because um I when I started it was in
 
04:31:20.349 --> 04:31:20.359 align:start position:0%
this room and the committee was chaired
 
04:31:23.149 --> 04:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
by representative David Cody who had
 
04:31:26.189 --> 04:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
significant mobility issues and for whom
 
04:31:28.469 --> 04:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
getting downstairs would have been I was
 
04:31:30.429 --> 04:31:30.439 align:start position:0%
on two I was on two committees with him
 
04:31:32.990 --> 04:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
last term I've never met him except on
 
04:31:37.630 --> 04:31:37.640 align:start position:0%
except on zoom and and he he but there
 
04:31:40.149 --> 04:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
was a room and it used to be prominently
 
04:31:40.159 --> 04:31:41.950 align:start position:0%
was a room and it used to be prominently
posted

04:31:41.950 --> 04:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
posted
 
04:31:44.950 --> 04:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
said shelter in place and that was the
 
04:31:47.149 --> 04:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
room that the conquered fire department
 
04:31:50.550 --> 04:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
knew to check that window first because
 
04:31:52.550 --> 04:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's where people that needed help
 
04:31:57.550 --> 04:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
getting out would be so and and I just
 
04:32:00.630 --> 04:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
we haven't talked about it at all since
 
04:32:04.630 --> 04:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
so the the term after that I was on Edna
 
04:32:07.990 --> 04:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
and I had two EMTs on the committee and
 
04:32:10.070 --> 04:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
I figured if anybody had Mobility
 
04:32:12.229 --> 04:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
problems they' they'd be dealing with it
 
04:32:14.670 --> 04:32:14.680 align:start position:0%
and getting them out so it was not going
 
04:32:17.670 --> 04:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
to be my personal responsibility to make
 
04:32:19.070 --> 04:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
sure people
 
04:32:21.349 --> 04:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
were taken care
 
04:32:25.149 --> 04:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
of okay back staircas is that does that
 
04:32:28.229 --> 04:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
open up it comes out it's it's comes out
 
04:32:32.590 --> 04:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
over the lob parking garage onto the
 
04:32:34.750 --> 04:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
deck of the parking garage and the only
 
04:32:36.109 --> 04:32:36.119 align:start position:0%
thing you need to know is you're not
 
04:32:38.309 --> 04:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
coming back that way unless you because
 
04:32:40.309 --> 04:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
it's not keyed or anything once it
 
04:32:42.070 --> 04:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
closes and closes you have to come back
 
04:32:44.030 --> 04:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
in the door and start over again we can
 
04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
go from this side we can go we can go
 
04:32:49.670 --> 04:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
out and I often do because I fortunate
 
04:32:51.429 --> 04:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
enough to be
 
04:32:54.750 --> 04:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
parked right under where the table we
 
04:32:57.550 --> 04:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
s okay I think we're I know it's over
 
04:33:00.429 --> 04:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
so okay let's
 
04:33:06.230 --> 04:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
reconvene and um the next bill up it is
 
04:33:09.750 --> 04:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:13.629 --> 04:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
p.m. uh next up is Senate Bill 4555 FN
 
04:33:16.709 --> 04:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
and I'll recognize the prime sponsor uh
 
04:33:22.990 --> 04:33:23.000 align:start position:0%

opportunity today to introduce
 
04:33:45.429 --> 04:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 455 for the record my name
 
04:33:47.070 --> 04:33:47.080 align:start position:0%

London so first I just want to tell you
 
04:34:01.551 --> 04:34:01.561 align:start position:0%
a little bit about why this bill is of
 
04:34:04.789 --> 04:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
interest to me in my so I'm and some of
 
04:34:06.629 --> 04:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
you I've spoken with you before you know
 
04:34:08.310 --> 04:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
that I have a background as a paramedic
 
04:34:10.070 --> 04:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
but in my my
 
04:34:12.670 --> 04:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
full-time work with a not for profit for
 
04:34:14.150 --> 04:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
The Last 5 Years called the American
 
04:34:15.910 --> 04:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
trauma Society I've been working with
 
04:34:18.029 --> 04:34:18.039 align:start position:0%
the trauma survivors Network that's one
 
04:34:20.990 --> 04:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
of our programs and within that space um
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
I have come to know the limb loss
 
04:34:26.109 --> 04:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
Community quite well and limb limb loss
 
04:34:27.910 --> 04:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
is not always because of trauma trauma
 
04:34:29.990 --> 04:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
is one of the reasons why it can be
 
04:34:32.349 --> 04:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
because of a A congenital defect and it
 
04:34:34.949 --> 04:34:34.959 align:start position:0%
can because be because of cancer but
 
04:34:37.109 --> 04:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
these are folks who have suffered limb
 
04:34:41.070 --> 04:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
loss and they are in need of a
 
04:34:43.590 --> 04:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
prosthetic device or an orthotic device
 
04:34:46.189 --> 04:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
and I have some folks with me from um
 
04:34:48.429 --> 04:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
seos Prosthetics and Orthotics who are
 
04:34:50.070 --> 04:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
going to talk about the differences
 
04:34:51.789 --> 04:34:51.799 align:start position:0%
between those one is supportive and one
 
04:34:54.789 --> 04:34:54.799 align:start position:0%
is actually a replacement for a limb so
 
04:34:57.830 --> 04:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
that they can you know connect in their
 
04:35:01.109 --> 04:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
community be active work you know
 
04:35:03.230 --> 04:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
quality you know quality of their lives
 
04:35:05.709 --> 04:35:05.719 align:start position:0%
and what we found out over time here in
 
04:35:08.709 --> 04:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that we have been we
 
04:35:11.349 --> 04:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
haven't been U you know we've been what
 
04:35:14.470 --> 04:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
I consider not woefully U reimbursing on
 
04:35:16.429 --> 04:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid side for this and
 
04:35:18.910 --> 04:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
considering how this actually not just
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
impacts their lives but impacts the
 
04:35:22.150 --> 04:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
communities that they live and work
 
04:35:24.070 --> 04:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
within I think we have an opportunity
 
04:35:28.670 --> 04:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
here to change this um so that's why I
 
04:35:31.590 --> 04:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
bring this before you what we have um
 
04:35:33.390 --> 04:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
been able to assess in now director
 
04:35:35.830 --> 04:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
Litman is not here today um John
 
04:35:37.750 --> 04:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
Williams from HHS told me that it was
 
04:35:40.750 --> 04:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
completely okay for me to say that HHS
 
04:35:43.629 --> 04:35:43.639 align:start position:0%
does support this bill um and what
 
04:35:45.269 --> 04:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
director Litman was able to assess is
 
04:35:48.830 --> 04:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
that we were at 80% of Medicare for
 
04:35:52.150 --> 04:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and so what we did
 
04:35:54.109 --> 04:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
considered is the incremental approach
 
04:35:56.990 --> 04:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
which has seemed to work in this with
 
04:35:58.269 --> 04:35:58.279 align:start position:0%
this kind of setting before and we're
 
04:36:00.590 --> 04:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
thinking about moving our um our
 
04:36:03.349 --> 04:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate up so we're looking or the
 
04:36:06.709 --> 04:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
ask here is to go from 80% to 90% to
 
04:36:10.750 --> 04:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
cover uh the pro at that rate to cover
 
04:36:14.551 --> 04:36:14.561 align:start position:0%
orthotic and prosthetic devices um so
 
04:36:16.789 --> 04:36:16.799 align:start position:0%
that is that's that's basically why
 
04:36:18.910 --> 04:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
we're here there is a manag care
 
04:36:21.830 --> 04:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
contract um that has actually driven the
 
04:36:24.189 --> 04:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
situation to where it is now that was
 
04:36:27.189 --> 04:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
signed off on that pushed the price down
 
04:36:29.750 --> 04:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
or the reimbursement down even further
 
04:36:32.269 --> 04:36:32.279 align:start position:0%
so what this will do is by raising it
 
04:36:34.910 --> 04:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to raising the base at the
 
04:36:36.269 --> 04:36:36.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:36:38.670 --> 04:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid level coming from there
 
04:36:40.949 --> 04:36:40.959 align:start position:0%
will actually be able to raise the
 
04:36:42.910 --> 04:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement on the Managed Care side
 
04:36:45.629 --> 04:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
as well so I appreciate the opportunity
 
04:36:47.029 --> 04:36:47.039 align:start position:0%
I think this is import this is very
 
04:36:49.429 --> 04:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
important for the limb loss community
 
04:36:52.189 --> 04:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
and again I you know it's one of the you
 
04:36:54.269 --> 04:36:54.279 align:start position:0%
know it's one of my passions in my work
 
04:36:56.750 --> 04:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
that I do here and the you know the New
 
04:36:58.750 --> 04:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature as well as in my
 
04:37:00.670 --> 04:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
you know my career as a you know
 
04:37:03.390 --> 04:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
paramedic traumacare professional so I'm
 
04:37:04.709 --> 04:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that you
 
04:37:07.029 --> 04:37:07.039 align:start position:0%
may have and if I can't I'm sure from a
 
04:37:08.629 --> 04:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
technical perspective the folks behind
 
04:37:11.470 --> 04:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
me are really great at doing this repr
 
04:37:11.480 --> 04:37:12.510 align:start position:0%
me are really great at doing this repr
representative

04:37:12.510 --> 04:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:37:14.789 --> 04:37:14.799 align:start position:0%
Shapero thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:37:17.910 --> 04:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question
 
04:37:22.230 --> 04:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
um if if reimbursement rates are low and
 
04:37:25.189 --> 04:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
it prevents people from getting new and
 
04:37:27.750 --> 04:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
effective equipment I'm I'm completely
 
04:37:31.990 --> 04:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
empathic to that idea
 
04:37:35.470 --> 04:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
however you know we hear regularly about
 
04:37:38.230 --> 04:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates being low so we can't get
 
04:37:40.310 --> 04:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
dentists to join the dental program
 
04:37:43.230 --> 04:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
because Medicaid rates are too low um
 
04:37:46.349 --> 04:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
there's a mental health crisis including
 
04:37:49.150 --> 04:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that we can't um the mental
 
04:37:53.070 --> 04:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
health centers can't um compete to hire
 
04:37:55.470 --> 04:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
people because primarily because
 
04:37:58.269 --> 04:37:58.279 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates are low and um they're
 
04:38:01.029 --> 04:38:01.039 align:start position:0%
Medicaid dependent we had
 
04:38:04.629 --> 04:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
a an a physician on this very committee
 
04:38:06.670 --> 04:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
talk about earlier this morning about
 
04:38:08.709 --> 04:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
how a lot of providers don't even build
 
04:38:12.390 --> 04:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and they just do it um
 
04:38:15.470 --> 04:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
that the bureaucratic demands were were
 
04:38:17.990 --> 04:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
more than the reimbursement they got so
 
04:38:20.470 --> 04:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
my question really
 
04:38:22.949 --> 04:38:22.959 align:start position:0%
is shouldn't this be done across the
 
04:38:26.750 --> 04:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
board for Medicaid rates um why would we
 
04:38:31.551 --> 04:38:31.561 align:start position:0%
take one specific area and um make it
 
04:38:34.390 --> 04:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
90% of Medicare which Medicare people
 
04:38:37.150 --> 04:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
say Medicare is inadequate as well but
 
04:38:39.910 --> 04:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
in any case why would we do this for one
 
04:38:42.590 --> 04:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
particular area of reimburse rather than
 
04:38:45.349 --> 04:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
across the board thank you for your
 
04:38:49.189 --> 04:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
question U it you know it would be in in
 
04:38:51.990 --> 04:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
the best set of circumstances I would be
 
04:38:54.269 --> 04:38:54.279 align:start position:0%
sitting in front of you talking about um
 
04:38:55.990 --> 04:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
you know durable medical equipment
 
04:38:57.910 --> 04:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
therapies and modalities across the
 
04:39:00.590 --> 04:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
board um the reality is that was you
 
04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
know quite honestly was not I wasn't
 
04:39:06.310 --> 04:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
approached across the board but what I
 
04:39:08.670 --> 04:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
will share with you is that and I think
 
04:39:09.709 --> 04:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
you already know this because you've
 
04:39:13.070 --> 04:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
done work in this area is that last year
 
04:39:17.629 --> 04:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
um we were able to raise rates um and
 
04:39:18.830 --> 04:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
and you know I could speak to the
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
Emergency Medical Services side of this
 
04:39:22.510 --> 04:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
but this was Workforce across the board
 
04:39:25.189 --> 04:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
to BR get more folks into the workforce
 
04:39:27.789 --> 04:39:27.799 align:start position:0%
so that we could have you know we had
 
04:39:31.470 --> 04:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
services available and that it was not
 
04:39:33.869 --> 04:39:33.879 align:start position:0%
it was worth it was worth the time and
 
04:39:36.670 --> 04:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
it provided the access to build Medicaid
 
04:39:39.070 --> 04:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
like we got it up to 100% And that's the
 
04:39:40.590 --> 04:39:40.600 align:start position:0%
first time you know for Emergency
 
04:39:43.430 --> 04:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
Medical Services for 17 years they were
 
04:39:45.430 --> 04:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
at 38% of Medicaid and I remember
 
04:39:47.628 --> 04:39:47.638 align:start position:0%
running an ambulance service when it it
 
04:39:49.708 --> 04:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
really we some we were like should you
 
04:39:51.470 --> 04:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
know what's going to H we we would Bill
 
04:39:54.670 --> 04:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
and get a check back for like $5 um so I
 
04:39:56.270 --> 04:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
think we have started to Trend with
 
04:39:58.230 --> 04:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
recognition in that direction and we did
 
04:40:00.910 --> 04:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
it in the workforce so giving you that
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
background I would love you know I would
 
04:40:04.230 --> 04:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
like to look at this broader right now
 
04:40:06.110 --> 04:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
this is the group that's come performing
 
04:40:08.510 --> 04:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
that has this need um and so I'm willing
 
04:40:10.190 --> 04:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
to advance this for them and this might
 
04:40:12.350 --> 04:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
help us get a larger group involved and
 
04:40:15.070 --> 04:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
have this discussion further thank you
 
04:40:18.030 --> 04:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
follow so I'm not really sure about this
 
04:40:20.868 --> 04:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
the the rate increases which I
 
04:40:24.350 --> 04:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
think well started being very low but
 
04:40:25.708 --> 04:40:25.718 align:start position:0%
they still the rate increases were
 
04:40:28.190 --> 04:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
dramatic and are very positive thing did
 
04:40:29.628 --> 04:40:29.638 align:start position:0%
they just
 
04:40:29.638 --> 04:40:31.230 align:start position:0%
they just
affect

04:40:31.230 --> 04:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
affect
 
04:40:34.750 --> 04:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
um services that providers performed or
 
04:40:37.390 --> 04:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
did they did those rate increases also
 
04:40:40.070 --> 04:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
affect things like prosthetic devices
 
04:40:41.750 --> 04:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't and medical equipment
 
04:40:44.070 --> 04:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
services that were performed is my
 
04:40:45.868 --> 04:40:45.878 align:start position:0%
understanding um I think that we would
 
04:40:47.150 --> 04:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
probably be in a different place today
 
04:40:49.310 --> 04:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
and not even having this conversation if
 
04:40:51.590 --> 04:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
it was in the other direction um I
 
04:40:53.390 --> 04:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
always think of it honestly if I may
 
04:40:54.910 --> 04:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
like being holistically that it's all
 
04:40:57.270 --> 04:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
one but the truth and reimbursement is
 
04:40:59.550 --> 04:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
that it's not so that's a great question
 
04:41:01.070 --> 04:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much you're
 
04:41:03.110 --> 04:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
04:41:05.150 --> 04:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
McLean thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:41:07.470 --> 04:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
for taking uh my question I'm kind of in
 
04:41:09.830 --> 04:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
the same you know headp space as
 
04:41:13.350 --> 04:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro but um one of the
 
04:41:17.230 --> 04:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
things is that 80% already is a higher
 
04:41:20.590 --> 04:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
rate than is being reimbursed in other
 
04:41:23.430 --> 04:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
areas so maybe historically you could
 
04:41:25.990 --> 04:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
just kind of tell us what are some of
 
04:41:29.190 --> 04:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
the things that have led to us being
 
04:41:32.110 --> 04:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursed at 80% as opposed to other
 
04:41:34.670 --> 04:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
areas um and and why we already at a
 
04:41:36.670 --> 04:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
high right there and I'm just curious to
 
04:41:38.910 --> 04:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
know why that is thank you for your
 
04:41:41.990 --> 04:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
question representative McAn oh so I
 
04:41:44.150 --> 04:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
think 100% is actually where we want to
 
04:41:47.350 --> 04:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
be in the end but I in respect to your
 
04:41:48.788 --> 04:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
question I think the best thing for me
 
04:41:51.070 --> 04:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
to do is let the folks from the orthotic
 
04:41:52.470 --> 04:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
and prosthetic Community they can
 
04:41:54.590 --> 04:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
address the the history I think which
 
04:41:56.750 --> 04:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
would be really drilled down for you
 
04:41:58.390 --> 04:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
okay In
 
04:42:00.510 --> 04:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
fairness other questions sorry I
 
04:42:02.270 --> 04:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be tapping my hands it's been
 
04:42:05.788 --> 04:42:05.798 align:start position:0%
a long day seeing no questions no other
 
04:42:07.270 --> 04:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
questions so okay thank you thank you
 
04:42:08.590 --> 04:42:08.600 align:start position:0%
chair thank you everyone it's always
 
04:42:18.550 --> 04:42:18.560 align:start position:0%

04:42:27.030 --> 04:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
Prosthetics have you asked for five
 
04:42:28.390 --> 04:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
minutes if you could keep it closer to
 
04:42:31.510 --> 04:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
three or so it' be better yeah thank
 
04:42:34.628 --> 04:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
you uh my name is Samantha torus uh
 
04:42:36.310 --> 04:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to be here I
 
04:42:38.110 --> 04:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
am the practice manager at seos
 
04:42:40.708 --> 04:42:40.718 align:start position:0%
Prosthetics uh we're a local uh locally
 
04:42:43.750 --> 04:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
owned an ampute owned uh prosthetic and
 
04:42:45.750 --> 04:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
orthotic provider in the SE Coast New
 
04:42:48.390 --> 04:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire area we also service areas
 
04:42:51.750 --> 04:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
around um the seos including Maine
 
04:42:53.910 --> 04:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and out even as far as
 
04:42:57.310 --> 04:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
Raymond eping um I know you had some
 
04:42:59.788 --> 04:42:59.798 align:start position:0%
questions about payments I hope I can
 
04:43:02.550 --> 04:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
clarify some of that for you so our
 
04:43:04.868 --> 04:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
reimbursements are really not at 80% of
 
04:43:07.070 --> 04:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
Medicare I would say they're about 30 to
 
04:43:09.948 --> 04:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
40% below the current Medicare rate
 
04:43:11.910 --> 04:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
which I know Medicare is increased the
 
04:43:14.150 --> 04:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
past few years which has been great um
 
04:43:15.670 --> 04:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the Medicaid
 
04:43:17.788 --> 04:43:17.798 align:start position:0%
reimbursements have not increased since
 
04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
July of 2021 for Prosthetics and
 
04:43:22.750 --> 04:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
Orthotics and durable medical
 
04:43:26.270 --> 04:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
equipment um our fees are considered
 
04:43:29.030 --> 04:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
bundled payments so they include
 
04:43:31.070 --> 04:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
appointments they include the device
 
04:43:34.070 --> 04:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
cost typically our orthotic patients are
 
04:43:36.628 --> 04:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
seen for a minimum of about two visits
 
04:43:39.070 --> 04:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
um our prosthetic patients can be seen
 
04:43:41.430 --> 04:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 8 to 10 visits and these
 
04:43:43.670 --> 04:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
visits are about half an hour to an hour
 
04:43:47.470 --> 04:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
long um so I just want to also note that
 
04:43:50.150 --> 04:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
we have about 800 Medicaid patients uh
 
04:43:51.788 --> 04:43:51.798 align:start position:0%
as part of our database and patients
 
04:43:53.948 --> 04:43:53.958 align:start position:0%
that we see
 
04:43:57.590 --> 04:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
um to kind of just explain it plainly um
 
04:43:59.948 --> 04:43:59.958 align:start position:0%
one of our knee braces that we provide
 
04:44:03.070 --> 04:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
that cost us
 
04:44:07.110 --> 04:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
$568 uh MediCare reimburses at
 
04:44:10.430 --> 04:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
$958 again this includes device cost and
 
04:44:12.110 --> 04:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
appointment fee
 
04:44:16.070 --> 04:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Medicaid reimburses at
 
04:44:18.390 --> 04:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
$524 and that means the Managed Care
 
04:44:20.948 --> 04:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
organizations who are about 20% below
 
04:44:23.550 --> 04:44:23.560 align:start position:0%
that uh they reimburse at
 
04:44:25.830 --> 04:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
$419 so right there when we see a
 
04:44:28.550 --> 04:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid patient we can't cover the cost
 
04:44:30.390 --> 04:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
of the device to see them and we're not
 
04:44:33.670 --> 04:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
being paid for the services
 
04:44:36.270 --> 04:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
provided so it's my hope that this
 
04:44:38.030 --> 04:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
committee will appreciate the value that
 
04:44:40.868 --> 04:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
we bring to our community in trying to
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
get get them back moving and on their
 
04:44:45.868 --> 04:44:45.878 align:start position:0%
feet and I hope that you'll consider
 
04:44:48.230 --> 04:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
increasing the reimbursements for us so
 
04:44:50.270 --> 04:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I can take any
 
04:44:52.948 --> 04:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
questions if you need uh representative
 
04:44:54.990 --> 04:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
04:44:57.830 --> 04:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um my introduction in
 
04:44:59.270 --> 04:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was I was the medical
 
04:45:00.990 --> 04:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
director at Easter Seals and we ran an
 
04:45:03.230 --> 04:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
onp Clinic back in the Glory Days when
 
04:45:05.310 --> 04:45:05.320 align:start position:0%
we were converting from metal to plastic
 
04:45:07.830 --> 04:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
which was an awesome time because we got
 
04:45:11.150 --> 04:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
to be very creative um I in discussion
 
04:45:12.470 --> 04:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
that I've had with other people I think
 
04:45:14.670 --> 04:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
it's really important and maybe you're
 
04:45:16.868 --> 04:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
follow you're going to speak too yeah to
 
04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
talk about what Orthotics actually is
 
04:45:21.270 --> 04:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
because um you know it's not just an
 
04:45:23.350 --> 04:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
off-the-shelf thing you do fabricate
 
04:45:25.430 --> 04:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
there correct yes yeah and actually um
 
04:45:26.948 --> 04:45:26.958 align:start position:0%
both Chris and Chris behind me they're
 
04:45:28.990 --> 04:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
co-owners um they're practitioners
 
04:45:31.788 --> 04:45:31.798 align:start position:0%
they're making the devices so um devices
 
04:45:33.628 --> 04:45:33.638 align:start position:0%
for Orthotics can range from foot
 
04:45:35.510 --> 04:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
Orthotics into your shoes all the way up
 
04:45:38.350 --> 04:45:38.360 align:start position:0%
to neck braces back braces knee braces
 
04:45:41.190 --> 04:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
um and they are custom fit and um
 
04:45:43.390 --> 04:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
customized for the patient that we see
 
04:45:44.788 --> 04:45:44.798 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of time that goes
 
04:45:48.110 --> 04:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
involved am I correct there is y so when
 
04:45:50.470 --> 04:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
you talked about hours or I'm sorry can
 
04:45:52.830 --> 04:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
I follow up um when you talked about
 
04:45:55.150 --> 04:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
hours before that's just face Toof face
 
04:45:56.670 --> 04:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
hours you're not talking about
 
04:45:59.948 --> 04:45:59.958 align:start position:0%
fabrication hours as well correct and
 
04:46:02.470 --> 04:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
you fabri oh sorry never mind okay
 
04:46:04.430 --> 04:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative Shapero thank you Mr
 
04:46:07.350 --> 04:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
chairman so if I heard you
 
04:46:09.868 --> 04:46:09.878 align:start position:0%
correctly you used one example of a
 
04:46:14.390 --> 04:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
device that that cost you mhm like $500
 
04:46:16.310 --> 04:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
and something dollars but you only got
 
04:46:18.350 --> 04:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursed by
 
04:46:18.360 --> 04:46:20.310 align:start position:0%
reimbursed by
Medicaid

04:46:20.310 --> 04:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
04:46:22.590 --> 04:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
524 and then you got reimbursed by
 
04:46:24.628 --> 04:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for 400 and something the
 
04:46:27.390 --> 04:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
Managed Care organizations and that did
 
04:46:29.990 --> 04:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
not and you didn't get any further
 
04:46:31.868 --> 04:46:31.878 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for the hours you spent
 
04:46:33.910 --> 04:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
actually meeting with the people for
 
04:46:37.270 --> 04:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
whatever diagnosis or
 
04:46:41.590 --> 04:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
um kind of developing the plan to so
 
04:46:44.830 --> 04:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious how your business
 
04:46:46.750 --> 04:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
survives that I mean how do you what do
 
04:46:49.830 --> 04:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
you do do you not do you not provide
 
04:46:52.270 --> 04:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
services to Medicaid patients do you do
 
04:46:54.990 --> 04:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
it and take a loss we do it we take a
 
04:46:58.548 --> 04:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
loss and it's getting harder every year
 
04:47:01.110 --> 04:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
because the cost of goods is going up um
 
04:47:03.030 --> 04:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
you know maybe five years ago it wasn't
 
04:47:06.670 --> 04:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
as bad um postco world our supply chain
 
04:47:09.628 --> 04:47:09.638 align:start position:0%
is crazy and the cost of goods has gone
 
04:47:12.310 --> 04:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
up quite a bit and it is really hard and
 
04:47:13.750 --> 04:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's why we reached out to sener
 
04:47:16.708 --> 04:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
Apprentice for that followup followup
 
04:47:20.110 --> 04:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
does that result in any way in raising
 
04:47:23.350 --> 04:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
the costs for other people who maybe
 
04:47:25.350 --> 04:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
have private insurance or paying out of
 
04:47:27.470 --> 04:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
pocket because you have to you have to
 
04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
survive we're pretty set with the
 
04:47:31.590 --> 04:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
contracts that we have we get reimbursed
 
04:47:33.230 --> 04:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
based on what we've agreed to with those
 
04:47:35.788 --> 04:47:35.798 align:start position:0%
separate um commercial insurances so we
 
04:47:37.708 --> 04:47:37.718 align:start position:0%
really don't have a chance to overbill
 
04:47:40.110 --> 04:47:40.120 align:start position:0%
anyone our coding structure is very
 
04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
strict about that so thank you
 
04:47:44.750 --> 04:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative Weber did you have your
 
04:47:47.070 --> 04:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
hand up uh no my question I did but my
 
04:47:48.990 --> 04:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
question could answer to thank you
 
04:47:51.230 --> 04:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative Nel thank you Mr chairman
 
04:47:53.190 --> 04:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
thanks again for taking my another
 
04:47:55.548 --> 04:47:55.558 align:start position:0%
question does this also include like
 
04:47:57.548 --> 04:47:57.558 align:start position:0%
wheelchair seating orthoses and things
 
04:47:59.390 --> 04:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
like that as well or it doesn't we're
 
04:48:01.270 --> 04:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
strictly Prosthetics and
 
04:48:04.190 --> 04:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
Orthotics if this bill pass can I ask a
 
04:48:06.470 --> 04:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
follow if the bill pass would that in
 
04:48:08.470 --> 04:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
include that for other vendors I'm not
 
04:48:11.110 --> 04:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
entirely sure how they bill um our
 
04:48:14.670 --> 04:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
coding is set by hick pit codes um I
 
04:48:15.910 --> 04:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
think I'd have to do a little bit more
 
04:48:17.628 --> 04:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
research just not in my wheelhouse for
 
04:48:20.470 --> 04:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
that yeah other
 
04:48:23.190 --> 04:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative mlan just super
 
04:48:24.670 --> 04:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
quick so actually your testimony
 
04:48:27.150 --> 04:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
answered a lot of my questions great um
 
04:48:29.230 --> 04:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
but um just to kind of follow up on
 
04:48:31.110 --> 04:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro do you know what
 
04:48:33.390 --> 04:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
the breakdown is in terms since you you
 
04:48:34.868 --> 04:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
know you can't recover cost anyway
 
04:48:35.990 --> 04:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
because it's kind of fixed across the
 
04:48:38.990 --> 04:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
board um actually so I guess it's kind
 
04:48:41.150 --> 04:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
of irrelevant in terms of who who is
 
04:48:43.830 --> 04:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
private insurance versus um what's
 
04:48:45.708 --> 04:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
Medicaid what is the what is the breakup
 
04:48:47.190 --> 04:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
I guess it's kind of irrelevant to you
 
04:48:49.310 --> 04:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
anyways isn't it yeah it doesn't so I
 
04:48:50.628 --> 04:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
withdraw my
 
04:48:52.830 --> 04:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
question other
 
04:48:55.150 --> 04:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
questions saying none thank you thank
 
04:49:01.310 --> 04:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:04.750 --> 04:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
much also signed up to speak is C
 
04:49:08.070 --> 04:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
crossdale from seast
 
04:49:10.030 --> 04:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
Prosthetics sorry did I call somebody
 
04:49:12.190 --> 04:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
out of order or
 
04:49:14.470 --> 04:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
no if you could give it to around three
 
04:49:17.310 --> 04:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
minutes sir appreciate it absolutely
 
04:49:19.270 --> 04:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Mr
 
04:49:21.990 --> 04:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
chairman um as one of the co-owners of
 
04:49:25.070 --> 04:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
seos orthotics and prics I think the the
 
04:49:26.510 --> 04:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
thing that's become critically important
 
04:49:30.070 --> 04:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
for us is the not just the decreasing
 
04:49:32.350 --> 04:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement over the past few years
 
04:49:34.030 --> 04:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
but the the simple fact that as we get
 
04:49:36.150 --> 04:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
more and more Medicare patients quite a
 
04:49:38.548 --> 04:49:38.558 align:start position:0%
lot of them have Medicaid as a secondary
 
04:49:41.750 --> 04:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
payer uh and of course you know
 
04:49:43.548 --> 04:49:43.558 align:start position:0%
traditionally Medicaid always paid that
 
04:49:46.910 --> 04:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
20% co-pay for medb devices and of
 
04:49:49.708 --> 04:49:49.718 align:start position:0%
course over the past few years that's
 
04:49:51.590 --> 04:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
been literally zero we've been getting
 
04:49:54.590 --> 04:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
nothing because obviously the um
 
04:49:58.670 --> 04:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
Medicare 80% was 100% of Medicaid as it
 
04:50:02.470 --> 04:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
was uh then rated so we get we we have
 
04:50:04.788 --> 04:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
to just forego that 20% and with
 
04:50:06.948 --> 04:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
increasing number of Medicare patients
 
04:50:09.150 --> 04:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
going forward that's putting an extra
 
04:50:11.628 --> 04:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
strain on the whole business um if I
 
04:50:14.230 --> 04:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
could also answer one question I heard a
 
04:50:16.430 --> 04:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
little earlier was uh how do we make up
 
04:50:19.110 --> 04:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
the deficit we we really have no options
 
04:50:21.150 --> 04:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
to make up the deficits we we have no
 
04:50:24.070 --> 04:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
way to sort of set what we charge we
 
04:50:26.670 --> 04:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
have no way to also negotiate with our
 
04:50:29.310 --> 04:50:29.320 align:start position:0%
suppliers what we can pay for devices we
 
04:50:32.590 --> 04:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
are a very small business um you know
 
04:50:34.150 --> 04:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
pretty much dealing with some fairly
 
04:50:37.110 --> 04:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
fine margins um the best thing we've
 
04:50:39.390 --> 04:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
been able to do over the past few years
 
04:50:42.788 --> 04:50:42.798 align:start position:0%
is to be extr extremely selective about
 
04:50:45.270 --> 04:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
what components we can afford to buy to
 
04:50:47.350 --> 04:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
provide to people but there does come a
 
04:50:48.788 --> 04:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
point where you want to be very careful
 
04:50:50.708 --> 04:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
you're not fitting a substandard part to
 
04:50:52.670 --> 04:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
somebody especially you know in a
 
04:50:52.680 --> 04:50:53.548 align:start position:0%
somebody especially you know in a
medical

04:50:53.548 --> 04:50:53.558 align:start position:0%
medical
 
04:50:56.310 --> 04:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
environment um I think another thing I
 
04:50:57.868 --> 04:50:57.878 align:start position:0%
would like to do is just indulge you for
 
04:50:59.628 --> 04:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
a couple of minutes on just an anecdotal
 
04:51:03.070 --> 04:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
story uh just to give an example um I
 
04:51:05.350 --> 04:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
had a Gentleman Just this morning he's
 
04:51:08.390 --> 04:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
um classic example he's he's one of many
 
04:51:10.590 --> 04:51:10.600 align:start position:0%
examples he he just happened to be my
 
04:51:12.628 --> 04:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
patient this morning um he had a very
 
04:51:14.990 --> 04:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
severe Road accident many years ago
 
04:51:16.868 --> 04:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
ended up losing his leg at the knee
 
04:51:20.910 --> 04:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
level on the left side um during his um
 
04:51:22.948 --> 04:51:22.958 align:start position:0%
you know early years he was able to be
 
04:51:25.350 --> 04:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
fitted with the prosthesis he was able
 
04:51:27.070 --> 04:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
to go back to work he was a single
 
04:51:29.390 --> 04:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
father bringing up two daughters in
 
04:51:31.270 --> 04:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
later years his mother got very very
 
04:51:33.270 --> 04:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
seriously ill she was obviously in her
 
04:51:34.948 --> 04:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
later years in life and so he had to
 
04:51:37.470 --> 04:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
look after his mother and so he he
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
eventually had to give up work and was
 
04:51:41.310 --> 04:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
relying on medication paid pretty much
 
04:51:43.788 --> 04:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
for all his Provisions during the time
 
04:51:45.708 --> 04:51:45.718 align:start position:0%
he was looking after his mother uh
 
04:51:47.390 --> 04:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
during that time obviously he needed
 
04:51:49.510 --> 04:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
plenty of prosthetic attention and he
 
04:51:51.868 --> 04:51:51.878 align:start position:0%
would come to us and the the
 
04:51:53.350 --> 04:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates were were very
 
04:51:56.070 --> 04:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
scarily low we really weren't able to do
 
04:51:58.390 --> 04:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
much except just try to maintain what he
 
04:52:00.548 --> 04:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
was doing for as long as possible just
 
04:52:02.110 --> 04:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
keep him on his feet so he could keep
 
04:52:03.470 --> 04:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
looking after his mom and his two
 
04:52:05.430 --> 04:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
daughters and the hope that eventually
 
04:52:08.310 --> 04:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
he he would go back to work um during
 
04:52:10.030 --> 04:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
that period of time we we obviously did
 
04:52:12.590 --> 04:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
have to take a loss uh because you know
 
04:52:15.310 --> 04:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
Prosthetics is expensive and over the
 
04:52:18.070 --> 04:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
past well year and a half we've seen
 
04:52:21.470 --> 04:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
cost of goods increased by approximately
 
04:52:24.510 --> 04:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
89% which has not been reflected in any
 
04:52:26.948 --> 04:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
reimbursements um luckily we were able
 
04:52:29.230 --> 04:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
to keep him going his his mother
 
04:52:30.910 --> 04:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
eventually did die his daughters have
 
04:52:33.390 --> 04:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
grown up and have moved on now um and
 
04:52:35.628 --> 04:52:35.638 align:start position:0%
he's just a single guy living on his own
 
04:52:37.070 --> 04:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
but because we're able to keep him on
 
04:52:39.670 --> 04:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
his feet he did eventually go back to
 
04:52:42.708 --> 04:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
work he works at a ski resort he's not
 
04:52:45.548 --> 04:52:45.558 align:start position:0%
doing anything athletic he's 71 now but
 
04:52:47.948 --> 04:52:47.958 align:start position:0%
he would prefer to work and so he now
 
04:52:49.910 --> 04:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
works in the administrative offices for
 
04:52:52.310 --> 04:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
the ski resort so he pays for his own
 
04:52:54.030 --> 04:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
insurance he's been off Medicaid for
 
04:52:56.628 --> 04:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
quite a while now and and so he's you
 
04:52:58.510 --> 04:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
know a happy productive member of
 
04:53:00.910 --> 04:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
society so ultimately he is saving money
 
04:53:03.350 --> 04:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
to the state in the long term if he were
 
04:53:05.030 --> 04:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
to be wheelchair bound he would be on
 
04:53:07.430 --> 04:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid add infin item so I think he's
 
04:53:09.270 --> 04:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
a good example of the many patients we
 
04:53:13.390 --> 04:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:15.590 --> 04:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
stances I think that's all I really want
 
04:53:17.430 --> 04:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
to add to this if there's any questions
 
04:53:19.110 --> 04:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any questions
 
04:53:21.110 --> 04:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
04:53:22.910 --> 04:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks again for taking my
 
04:53:26.030 --> 04:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
question um whenever we watch TV and we
 
04:53:30.030 --> 04:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
see like the um you know the um adapted
 
04:53:31.708 --> 04:53:31.718 align:start position:0%
games and things like that we see some
 
04:53:35.590 --> 04:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
really cool leg types um um I'm just
 
04:53:38.350 --> 04:53:38.360 align:start position:0%
wondering if in this en in reimbursement
 
04:53:39.670 --> 04:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
environment and I don't want to use the
 
04:53:41.910 --> 04:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
word cut corner but I'm going to use it
 
04:53:44.390 --> 04:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
do you have to cut Corners to use um
 
04:53:47.150 --> 04:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
devices of lesser value for that
 
04:53:48.830 --> 04:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
particular age group merely because of
 
04:53:50.910 --> 04:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement that you
 
04:53:54.270 --> 04:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
got um I also hate to use the word cut c
 
04:53:56.590 --> 04:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I didn't mean the word but yeah um
 
04:53:59.990 --> 04:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
basically compromise um yeah I mean we
 
04:54:01.830 --> 04:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
there is some compromise involved I mean
 
04:54:04.548 --> 04:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
basically for specific L code sets which
 
04:54:06.190 --> 04:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
is how we both of these things there'll
 
04:54:08.310 --> 04:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
be a range of things like knees or feet
 
04:54:09.628 --> 04:54:09.638 align:start position:0%
or something like this and we can
 
04:54:11.708 --> 04:54:11.718 align:start position:0%
usually pick the most suitable one out
 
04:54:14.230 --> 04:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
of that range of feet uh that's
 
04:54:16.628 --> 04:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
available but with uh reimbursements
 
04:54:19.390 --> 04:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
levels the way they are now you know the
 
04:54:22.190 --> 04:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
highest end of that range is is not
 
04:54:24.628 --> 04:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
usually something we can we can offer we
 
04:54:26.350 --> 04:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
can get something close and it would do
 
04:54:28.070 --> 04:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
them for a while but it wouldn't be a
 
04:54:30.390 --> 04:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
great long-term solution we just have to
 
04:54:31.750 --> 04:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
hope that we can keep them going long
 
04:54:34.830 --> 04:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
enough that we you know we can sustain
 
04:54:36.548 --> 04:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
looking after them the best way we can
 
04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
over the next few years I mean the thing
 
04:54:40.910 --> 04:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
about you know Prosthetics is you know
 
04:54:43.910 --> 04:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
that patient is with you for life either
 
04:54:46.708 --> 04:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
yours or theirs so you know in in all
 
04:54:48.390 --> 04:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
honesty you have you you don't want to
 
04:54:49.788 --> 04:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
cut Corners because sooner or later
 
04:54:51.548 --> 04:54:51.558 align:start position:0%
they're going to say you didn't give me
 
04:54:52.670 --> 04:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
the best thing available and they'll
 
04:54:55.628 --> 04:54:55.638 align:start position:0%
move on which is fair so we always have
 
04:54:57.270 --> 04:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
to look after them the best we can but
 
04:55:00.030 --> 04:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
it is a judgment as to exactly you know
 
04:55:02.670 --> 04:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
how much quality componentry we can
 
04:55:04.868 --> 04:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
include because they'll come a point
 
04:55:06.788 --> 04:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
where we we just lose so much that as a
 
04:55:09.150 --> 04:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
business we would cease to exist yeah
 
04:55:11.150 --> 04:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
thanks other question questions
 
04:55:13.670 --> 04:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you Mr
 
04:55:15.788 --> 04:55:15.798 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking questions
 
04:55:17.830 --> 04:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
I'm really optimistic about charitable
 
04:55:19.948 --> 04:55:19.958 align:start position:0%
donations and things like that um there
 
04:55:22.990 --> 04:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
was this one lady a few months ago I saw
 
04:55:25.390 --> 04:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
in the news she lost all four limbs in
 
04:55:28.548 --> 04:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
one day from like sepsis or something
 
04:55:30.510 --> 04:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
and since then she's raised like
 
04:55:33.750 --> 04:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
$300,000 through GoFundMe to pay for
 
04:55:36.830 --> 04:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
like everything um do you have any
 
04:55:38.868 --> 04:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
system like that set up where you could
 
04:55:41.030 --> 04:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
either do you know charitable
 
04:55:42.868 --> 04:55:42.878 align:start position:0%
crowdfunding donations for individuals
 
04:55:45.230 --> 04:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
or just maybe your business in general
 
04:55:47.070 --> 04:55:47.080 align:start position:0%
you you put out uh something like that
 
04:55:48.868 --> 04:55:48.878 align:start position:0%
and you say look we're running about
 
04:55:50.670 --> 04:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
just making up numbers here $100,000
 
04:55:52.788 --> 04:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
shortfall every year if we could get
 
04:55:54.788 --> 04:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
that you know you might have thousands
 
04:55:56.670 --> 04:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
of people donating $5 a year and there
 
04:55:58.230 --> 04:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
and next thing you know you're covered I
 
04:56:00.990 --> 04:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
mean charity is so easy nowadays um what
 
04:56:02.788 --> 04:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
are your thoughts on that thanks there
 
04:56:04.590 --> 04:56:04.600 align:start position:0%
are definitely a lot of organizations
 
04:56:06.910 --> 04:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
that do focus on just those things but
 
04:56:08.750 --> 04:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
we as a business don't really try to get
 
04:56:10.110 --> 04:56:10.120 align:start position:0%
involved in the charitable side of
 
04:56:12.708 --> 04:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
things I think it's kind of a an Effy
 
04:56:14.628 --> 04:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
road to go down because of you know
 
04:56:17.990 --> 04:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
having to keep very tight um control
 
04:56:20.110 --> 04:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
over where you allocate what money you
 
04:56:22.628 --> 04:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
know um we we help the patients the best
 
04:56:25.750 --> 04:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
we can by um you know we have even X
 
04:56:28.110 --> 04:56:28.120 align:start position:0%
patients donating things that we can
 
04:56:30.270 --> 04:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
often recycle but you know we're limited
 
04:56:32.830 --> 04:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
by what we can do as a business as far
 
04:56:34.470 --> 04:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
as getting involved with the
 
04:56:37.310 --> 04:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
Charities um you know and again a lot of
 
04:56:39.990 --> 04:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
our patients probably aren't you know
 
04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
the most most exciting examples that
 
04:56:43.310 --> 04:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
Charities want to get involved with some
 
04:56:45.150 --> 04:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
of them have other co-morbidities
 
04:56:47.510 --> 04:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're not going to lead exciting lives
 
04:56:49.590 --> 04:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
their goal is to get to the grocery
 
04:56:51.670 --> 04:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
store and back again without needing any
 
04:56:53.750 --> 04:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
assistance uh and some of them do have
 
04:56:56.590 --> 04:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
you know work that they want to maintain
 
04:56:58.628 --> 04:56:58.638 align:start position:0%
um it's it's not you know we do know
 
04:57:00.110 --> 04:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
Charities and we can put them in touch
 
04:57:02.510 --> 04:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
with Charities but then we we cut off
 
04:57:03.708 --> 04:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
from there we're not really getting
 
04:57:05.788 --> 04:57:05.798 align:start position:0%
involved with the
 
04:57:07.910 --> 04:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
Charities representative
 
04:57:10.270 --> 04:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
pazo thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:57:12.510 --> 04:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh I don't know
 
04:57:16.548 --> 04:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
this system so excuse me if it's a basic
 
04:57:19.628 --> 04:57:19.638 align:start position:0%
question uh to part are you allowed to
 
04:57:25.030 --> 04:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
deny or delay a client and uh uh are you
 
04:57:29.070 --> 04:57:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:29.080 --> 04:57:31.548 align:start position:0%
 
COR

04:57:31.548 --> 04:57:31.558 align:start position:0%
COR
 
04:57:34.628 --> 04:57:34.638 align:start position:0%
um I mean we can either deny treatment
 
04:57:36.868 --> 04:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
all together or not but we we have to
 
04:57:39.470 --> 04:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
have a good concrete reason to do that
 
04:57:41.350 --> 04:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
um generally someone comes to us with no
 
04:57:42.990 --> 04:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
insurance whatsoever we're going to work
 
04:57:44.750 --> 04:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
pretty diligently to try and find them
 
04:57:47.190 --> 04:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
some kind of funding whether it's maybe
 
04:57:50.548 --> 04:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
through vote rehab or or or some charity
 
04:57:52.470 --> 04:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
some something like this that we can we
 
04:57:55.830 --> 04:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
can refer them to um so we have been
 
04:57:57.948 --> 04:57:57.958 align:start position:0%
very lucky that we've never had to deny
 
04:58:02.430 --> 04:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
treatment on cost grounds um but again
 
04:58:05.030 --> 04:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know pragmatically speaking we we
 
04:58:07.548 --> 04:58:07.558 align:start position:0%
just have to be cognizant of the fact
 
04:58:09.150 --> 04:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
that we're going to take some something
 
04:58:10.708 --> 04:58:10.718 align:start position:0%
of a hit on that
 
04:58:12.310 --> 04:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
and we we have to try and minimize the
 
04:58:14.230 --> 04:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
hit you know because unfortunately if we
 
04:58:15.590 --> 04:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
were to try and do that for every single
 
04:58:17.030 --> 04:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
patient we would have already been out
 
04:58:19.868 --> 04:58:19.878 align:start position:0%
of business by now yeah the margins are
 
04:58:22.110 --> 04:58:22.120 align:start position:0%
just too fine with Medicaid and you know
 
04:58:25.150 --> 04:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
Medicaid patients are increasing so and
 
04:58:27.990 --> 04:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
and as you know our practice manager
 
04:58:30.470 --> 04:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
sort of explained when it comes to you
 
04:58:32.150 --> 04:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
know dealing with Medicaid a lot more
 
04:58:33.750 --> 04:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
patient patients are now being pushed
 
04:58:36.470 --> 04:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
onto Medicaid Advantage Plans which
 
04:58:40.230 --> 04:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
again are another 20% below Medicaid so
 
04:58:42.230 --> 04:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
that point you are definitely paying
 
04:58:44.590 --> 04:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
more just to order the device than
 
04:58:46.070 --> 04:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
you're ever going to be reimbursed for
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
it and that doesn't include things like
 
04:58:50.708 --> 04:58:50.718 align:start position:0%
shipping or warranties or follow-ups or
 
04:58:52.910 --> 04:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
adjustments right there are multiple
 
04:58:54.750 --> 04:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
appointments needed and at that stage
 
04:58:56.670 --> 04:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
we've accepted the fact that pretty much
 
04:58:58.910 --> 04:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
those are free by that
 
04:59:01.110 --> 04:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
stage representative
 
04:59:04.390 --> 04:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
naram thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
04:59:07.868 --> 04:59:07.878 align:start position:0%
for taking my question do you um service
 
04:59:10.868 --> 04:59:10.878 align:start position:0%
veterans yes we do have a VA contracts
 
04:59:13.868 --> 04:59:13.878 align:start position:0%
and we do serve as veterans okay and do
 
04:59:17.070 --> 04:59:17.080 align:start position:0%
they pay better they they do I mean we
 
04:59:18.190 --> 04:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
have a contract with the VA at the
 
04:59:20.270 --> 04:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
moment that's about 5% less than
 
04:59:23.910 --> 04:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
Medicare 5% less 5% they pay 100% of
 
04:59:26.150 --> 04:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
whatever the the cost is okay thank you
 
04:59:29.270 --> 04:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
very much other
 
04:59:32.628 --> 04:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you thank you
 
04:59:32.638 --> 04:59:36.270 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you thank you
thank

04:59:36.270 --> 04:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:39.350 --> 04:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Christoph
 
04:59:42.110 --> 04:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh Christopher phips and so you've asked
 
04:59:43.750 --> 04:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
for 5 to 10 minutes if you could keep it
 
04:59:45.788 --> 04:59:45.798 align:start position:0%
closer to three I'd really appreciate it
 
04:59:48.590 --> 04:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
sure yeah thank you for uh for having us
 
04:59:51.070 --> 04:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
here today so I'm Chris Phillips I'm a
 
04:59:53.510 --> 04:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
the co-owner of seos Prosthetics I'm
 
04:59:56.750 --> 04:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
also a congenital amputee from birth uh
 
04:59:59.310 --> 04:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
so I grew up um my parents were lucky to
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
have good insurance and I was um you
 
05:00:04.628 --> 05:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
know able to get grade care uh growing
 
05:00:06.628 --> 05:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
up and then went into the industry to to
 
05:00:08.430 --> 05:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
really try to help people like myself we
 
05:00:10.628 --> 05:00:10.638 align:start position:0%
do a lot of children it's work through
 
05:00:12.470 --> 05:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
the Monarch school which uh brings
 
05:00:13.948 --> 05:00:13.958 align:start position:0%
students from all over the state to
 
05:00:16.628 --> 05:00:16.638 align:start position:0%
Rochester uh they're severely uh
 
05:00:18.708 --> 05:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
disabled we do a lot of bracing for for
 
05:00:20.590 --> 05:00:20.600 align:start position:0%
those kids most of them are on some type
 
05:00:23.670 --> 05:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
of managed Medicaid at least uh either
 
05:00:26.030 --> 05:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
full Medicaid or secondary Medicaid to
 
05:00:28.230 --> 05:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
their parents insurance to cover the you
 
05:00:29.750 --> 05:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
know excess cost such as high
 
05:00:32.590 --> 05:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
deductibles and things like that so I've
 
05:00:34.990 --> 05:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
been doing this uh in New Hampshire for
 
05:00:38.708 --> 05:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
about 20 years now um and certainly I've
 
05:00:40.270 --> 05:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
owned a co-own this business business
 
05:00:43.590 --> 05:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
for 10 years U with with Chris
 
05:00:47.430 --> 05:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
crosdale and seems like in the last 5 to
 
05:00:49.590 --> 05:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
six years every year we have a
 
05:00:51.390 --> 05:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether we're going to
 
05:00:55.430 --> 05:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
continue seeing Medicaid patients um and
 
05:00:57.590 --> 05:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
I have people from Monarch school I have
 
05:01:01.390 --> 05:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
my uh pediatric um physical therapists
 
05:01:02.788 --> 05:01:02.798 align:start position:0%
you know every year asking me if we're
 
05:01:03.910 --> 05:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
going to keep
 
05:01:07.110 --> 05:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
going um and every year we look at the
 
05:01:09.190 --> 05:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
numbers and we realize that we're
 
05:01:12.190 --> 05:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
basically implementing the Medicaid
 
05:01:14.868 --> 05:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
Program uh you know through our own
 
05:01:17.510 --> 05:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
personal funding basically to keep
 
05:01:19.310 --> 05:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
seeing these kids and seeing these
 
05:01:21.750 --> 05:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
people that uh really need our
 
05:01:21.760 --> 05:01:23.310 align:start position:0%
people that uh really need our
services

05:01:23.310 --> 05:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:01:25.628 --> 05:01:25.638 align:start position:0%
um and I I just feel like that there's
 
05:01:27.708 --> 05:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
going to be a year pretty soon where
 
05:01:29.350 --> 05:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
we're just not going to be able to do
 
05:01:31.150 --> 05:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
that and I I do think that if you look
 
05:01:34.110 --> 05:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
at the other o companies in the state
 
05:01:36.070 --> 05:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
we're a pretty small group there's only
 
05:01:37.708 --> 05:01:37.718 align:start position:0%
five or six of us in the state and we're
 
05:01:40.230 --> 05:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
being taken over uh the smaller
 
05:01:42.310 --> 05:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
companies uh are being taken over by
 
05:01:44.270 --> 05:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
larger corporations and they're making
 
05:01:48.510 --> 05:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
decisions not to take Medicaid so you'll
 
05:01:50.628 --> 05:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
see and and we've you know honestly we
 
05:01:52.750 --> 05:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
made the decision probably four or five
 
05:01:55.030 --> 05:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
years ago to not take wellsense which
 
05:01:56.708 --> 05:01:56.718 align:start position:0%
was one of the manage Medica AIDS
 
05:01:58.110 --> 05:01:58.120 align:start position:0%
because of the bureaucracy to get
 
05:02:04.110 --> 05:02:04.120 align:start position:0%
through pre-authorizations and oh um and
 
05:02:05.350 --> 05:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
so we take New Hampshire Healthy
 
05:02:08.270 --> 05:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
Families and then straight Medicaid and
 
05:02:11.590 --> 05:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
um and with this this increase which is
 
05:02:13.590 --> 05:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
still only 10% because remember the
 
05:02:15.990 --> 05:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
managed cares are allowed to take a 20%
 
05:02:18.670 --> 05:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
cut off of that 10% so right now they're
 
05:02:20.948 --> 05:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
taking 40 plus percent off of of
 
05:02:22.788 --> 05:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
Medicare but if we could get the extra
 
05:02:25.270 --> 05:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
10% then it would only be a 30% decrease
 
05:02:27.190 --> 05:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
which is still not great but it is a
 
05:02:30.830 --> 05:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
little bit better um we had talked about
 
05:02:32.190 --> 05:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
trying to pick up a contract with
 
05:02:33.708 --> 05:02:33.718 align:start position:0%
wellsense again because a lot of the
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
children that we see you know have
 
05:02:36.948 --> 05:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
wellsense instead of New Hampshire
 
05:02:38.990 --> 05:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
Healthy Families so a goal would be to
 
05:02:40.830 --> 05:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
you know continue to provide care for
 
05:02:42.788 --> 05:02:42.798 align:start position:0%
these kids and for these folks that you
 
05:02:44.310 --> 05:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
know have these other Medicaid it's not
 
05:02:46.150 --> 05:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
just kids I see a lot of amputees that
 
05:02:48.590 --> 05:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
have Medicaid as well
 
05:02:52.548 --> 05:02:52.558 align:start position:0%
um but my concern is that uh you know if
 
05:02:56.030 --> 05:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
if this funding isn't uh increased that
 
05:02:57.868 --> 05:02:57.878 align:start position:0%
you know we're a small company we have
 
05:02:57.878 --> 05:02:58.708 align:start position:0%
you know we're a small company we have
six

05:02:58.708 --> 05:02:58.718 align:start position:0%
six
 
05:03:01.910 --> 05:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
employees uh and at some point uh which
 
05:03:03.390 --> 05:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
I think would be fairly soon we're going
 
05:03:06.910 --> 05:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
to make that decision um you know to not
 
05:03:09.390 --> 05:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
take Medicaid again or in going forward
 
05:03:11.030 --> 05:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're here and that's why
 
05:03:12.910 --> 05:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
we reached out to uh Senator apprentice
 
05:03:16.230 --> 05:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you for that time thank you uh
 
05:03:17.670 --> 05:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel and then
 
05:03:19.750 --> 05:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thanks
 
05:03:21.390 --> 05:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question thanks for all
 
05:03:24.868 --> 05:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
you do I really appreciate that so um if
 
05:03:28.070 --> 05:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
not you then where will these people
 
05:03:32.070 --> 05:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
go right so I do believe that there's a
 
05:03:35.310 --> 05:03:35.320 align:start position:0%
uh our competitors on the Sea Coast
 
05:03:37.470 --> 05:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
there's only one so far it's Hangar
 
05:03:39.190 --> 05:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
Prosthetics and I don't believe they
 
05:03:45.788 --> 05:03:45.798 align:start position:0%
take medic at this time um so uh so they
 
05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
would most likely go to if they were on
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast they would have to go to
 
05:03:53.150 --> 05:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
conquered uh we have other patients
 
05:03:54.670 --> 05:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
where there's some services that we
 
05:03:54.680 --> 05:03:55.628 align:start position:0%
where there's some services that we
don't

05:03:55.628 --> 05:03:55.638 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:03:58.990 --> 05:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
provide uh that that go up to Littleton
 
05:04:00.948 --> 05:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
from the Sea Coast to see you know
 
05:04:03.350 --> 05:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
certain providers so I do think you know
 
05:04:05.510 --> 05:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
if there's only five or six of us in the
 
05:04:07.110 --> 05:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
state and we're all in different
 
05:04:07.120 --> 05:04:08.430 align:start position:0%
state and we're all in different
geographical

05:04:08.430 --> 05:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
geographical
 
05:04:10.230 --> 05:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
locations um
 
05:04:11.548 --> 05:04:11.558 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a burden for those
 
05:04:12.830 --> 05:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
people to
 
05:04:15.430 --> 05:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
travel representative
 
05:04:19.190 --> 05:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
Shapero thank you Mr chair so could you
 
05:04:24.310 --> 05:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
explain a little bit um for me about the
 
05:04:26.030 --> 05:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
distinct you said that you
 
05:04:28.788 --> 05:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
take at least maybe two of the three
 
05:04:31.750 --> 05:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
managed care companies and also straight
 
05:04:34.310 --> 05:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so when someone's not on
 
05:04:36.270 --> 05:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid but they're not um enrolled
 
05:04:38.510 --> 05:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
with one of the managed care companies
 
05:04:40.708 --> 05:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
so could you explain to
 
05:04:43.510 --> 05:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
me the distinction between when you
 
05:04:47.750 --> 05:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
build the state directly for someone on
 
05:04:49.868 --> 05:04:49.878 align:start position:0%
on straight Medicaid versus one of the
 
05:04:51.510 --> 05:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
managed care companies and what's the
 
05:04:53.910 --> 05:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
distinction in how much you get paid yes
 
05:04:56.868 --> 05:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
so I might have to rely on Samantha but
 
05:04:59.510 --> 05:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
but it's my understanding that you know
 
05:05:03.310 --> 05:05:03.320 align:start position:0%
straight State Medicaid is
 
05:05:06.510 --> 05:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
20% at currently is 20% below the
 
05:05:08.708 --> 05:05:08.718 align:start position:0%
Medicare allowable so if we were
 
05:05:11.270 --> 05:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
building you know know $100 they would
 
05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
reimburse $80 and you know and it's how
 
05:05:15.990 --> 05:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
it used to be before the managed cares
 
05:05:17.670 --> 05:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
came we talked to someone directly in
 
05:05:19.430 --> 05:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
the state we got prior authorization we
 
05:05:21.990 --> 05:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
sent a bill and we got that contracted
 
05:05:24.628 --> 05:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
rate which was you know certainly below
 
05:05:27.150 --> 05:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
so right now if we're um seeing someone
 
05:05:28.670 --> 05:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire Healthy Families
 
05:05:31.948 --> 05:05:31.958 align:start position:0%
we're doing a prior authorization uh so
 
05:05:33.990 --> 05:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking to someone in another
 
05:05:37.510 --> 05:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
state usually not sure um we're getting
 
05:05:39.590 --> 05:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
a prioritization we're waiting we're
 
05:05:41.190 --> 05:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
submitting documentation and then
 
05:05:42.948 --> 05:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
they're going to approve that
 
05:05:45.548 --> 05:05:45.558 align:start position:0%
hopefully and then we would get
 
05:05:49.628 --> 05:05:49.638 align:start position:0%
reimbursed at least 40% below Medicare
 
05:05:54.670 --> 05:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
so the current managed Medicaid is
 
05:05:58.548 --> 05:05:58.558 align:start position:0%
allowed to Bild by the state 20% below
 
05:06:02.230 --> 05:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
the State Medicaid level so that's 40%
 
05:06:03.628 --> 05:06:03.638 align:start position:0%
below Medicaid
 
05:06:05.910 --> 05:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
Medicare 40% that's where you get that
 
05:06:08.548 --> 05:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
knee brace situation where we're getting
 
05:06:08.558 --> 05:06:10.830 align:start position:0%
knee brace situation where we're getting
reimbursed

05:06:10.830 --> 05:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursed
 
05:06:13.190 --> 05:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
$60 less than the actual cost of the
 
05:06:15.230 --> 05:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
device I've seen that patient two to
 
05:06:18.390 --> 05:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
three times for 30 to 40 minutes each
 
05:06:22.510 --> 05:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
time uh to evaluate to measure to then
 
05:06:25.470 --> 05:06:25.480 align:start position:0%
fit the device uh or if it's a custom
 
05:06:27.868 --> 05:06:27.878 align:start position:0%
made device then I'm seeing them to cast
 
05:06:29.628 --> 05:06:29.638 align:start position:0%
I'm filling that with plaster or
 
05:06:33.270 --> 05:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
scanning that in three uh 3D printing
 
05:06:35.030 --> 05:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
and then I'm fabricating it by hand and
 
05:06:36.750 --> 05:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
then I'm coming back and fitting it and
 
05:06:38.030 --> 05:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
then we're seeing them usually for a
 
05:06:40.670 --> 05:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
followup as well so
 
05:06:44.708 --> 05:06:44.718 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up so I know that the
 
05:06:48.030 --> 05:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
idea of having
 
05:06:51.590 --> 05:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
um Medicaid be managed by these
 
05:06:53.750 --> 05:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
companies is that it will be more
 
05:06:53.760 --> 05:06:55.868 align:start position:0%
companies is that it will be more
efficient

05:06:55.868 --> 05:06:55.878 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
05:07:00.110 --> 05:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
um and save money um but in your
 
05:07:03.190 --> 05:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
situation you're taking a you you're
 
05:07:05.948 --> 05:07:05.958 align:start position:0%
having more of a deficit from because
 
05:07:08.350 --> 05:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
they're there so I'm I know you're a
 
05:07:10.390 --> 05:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
small company and there only a few of
 
05:07:13.070 --> 05:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
you so this is maybe an unrealistic
 
05:07:16.030 --> 05:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
question but has there been any attempt
 
05:07:19.510 --> 05:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
to kind of address this issue with
 
05:07:22.190 --> 05:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
directly to DHHS to the to the
 
05:07:24.868 --> 05:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
Department of Medicaid um or whatever
 
05:07:27.750 --> 05:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
they're called um and and and what kind
 
05:07:31.030 --> 05:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
of um feedback have you gotten yes so
 
05:07:34.670 --> 05:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
Samantha and I had a um a meeting with
 
05:07:37.910 --> 05:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS maybe two and a half years ago
 
05:07:41.868 --> 05:07:41.878 align:start position:0%
sorry um and uh and we explained exactly
 
05:07:43.830 --> 05:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
that situation we provided data we had
 
05:07:45.548 --> 05:07:45.558 align:start position:0%
Excel spreadsheets showing all the
 
05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
different coding we build all of the
 
05:07:48.788 --> 05:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
reimbursements and all the time that we
 
05:07:51.910 --> 05:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
estimated that each of those um device
 
05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
fittings Incorporated from high high
 
05:07:56.628 --> 05:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
level Prosthetics all the way down to
 
05:07:58.830 --> 05:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
simple you know Foo Orthotics that go
 
05:08:03.990 --> 05:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
into shoes um and it was all basically
 
05:08:06.750 --> 05:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
all in a deficit and we explained you
 
05:08:08.310 --> 05:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
know the managed cares were taking the
 
05:08:11.750 --> 05:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
20% uh and they were very understanding
 
05:08:14.910 --> 05:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
and very sympathetic and then we never
 
05:08:17.510 --> 05:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
heard from them again so that's part of
 
05:08:20.548 --> 05:08:20.558 align:start position:0%
the reason that we have reached out um
 
05:08:23.910 --> 05:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know to U Senator Apprentice thank
 
05:08:26.830 --> 05:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
you yeah Senator Nagel again thank you
 
05:08:30.070 --> 05:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thanks for taking my question
 
05:08:32.788 --> 05:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
so when I was at Easter Seals we had a
 
05:08:34.990 --> 05:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
it was a small vendor that had a shop on
 
05:08:41.070 --> 05:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
site and um um this was 30 years ago so
 
05:08:43.670 --> 05:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
we lost money on Medicaid period the way
 
05:08:45.628 --> 05:08:45.638 align:start position:0%
we made money though was the wham bam
 
05:08:47.670 --> 05:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am quick off the shelf
 
05:08:50.670 --> 05:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
Braes and um what I've observed over the
 
05:08:53.070 --> 05:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
last 20 years is that a lot of non
 
05:08:55.708 --> 05:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
orthotist non prosus people are actually
 
05:08:58.230 --> 05:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
selling those things fitting those
 
05:09:01.070 --> 05:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
things in my observation taking money
 
05:09:04.628 --> 05:09:04.638 align:start position:0%
away from you correct is is that a real
 
05:09:06.310 --> 05:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
thing that you're observing does that
 
05:09:07.868 --> 05:09:07.878 align:start position:0%
affect your bottom line and your ability
 
05:09:09.830 --> 05:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
to stay afloat
 
05:09:12.548 --> 05:09:12.558 align:start position:0%
it it's it's a good question and it's
 
05:09:16.430 --> 05:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's a catch22 because uh you know a lot
 
05:09:17.670 --> 05:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
of these things are being fit in
 
05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
Orthopedic offices which is you know and
 
05:09:22.030 --> 05:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
we've kind of accepted that as a
 
05:09:24.070 --> 05:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
profession that wrist splints and
 
05:09:26.110 --> 05:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
aircast boots and things that you know
 
05:09:27.868 --> 05:09:27.878 align:start position:0%
you break my my son broke his toe
 
05:09:29.030 --> 05:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
yesterday so he's going to be in an
 
05:09:32.830 --> 05:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
aircast boot tomorrow uh I'll try to fit
 
05:09:34.628 --> 05:09:34.638 align:start position:0%
it but he could easily get that at an
 
05:09:38.990 --> 05:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
orthopedic Physician's office um and so
 
05:09:41.430 --> 05:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
we've really tried to differentiate
 
05:09:44.110 --> 05:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
oursel as a profession to do more custom
 
05:09:46.948 --> 05:09:46.958 align:start position:0%
fabricated devices so especially our
 
05:09:49.708 --> 05:09:49.718 align:start position:0%
office and and some uh some OMP
 
05:09:51.750 --> 05:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
facilities blend like all this DME
 
05:09:53.390 --> 05:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
equipment as well and they have kind of
 
05:09:55.190 --> 05:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
two separate entities in their under the
 
05:09:58.110 --> 05:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
one roof but our practice you know
 
05:10:01.270 --> 05:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
because I think Chris's background is a
 
05:10:03.590 --> 05:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
prosthetist my background is an amput
 
05:10:05.628 --> 05:10:05.638 align:start position:0%
and and wanting to do more custom
 
05:10:08.910 --> 05:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
fabricated uh devices we haven't really
 
05:10:08.920 --> 05:10:10.030 align:start position:0%
fabricated uh devices we haven't really
been

05:10:10.030 --> 05:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:10:13.270 --> 05:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
um too concerned about a lot of that uh
 
05:10:15.948 --> 05:10:15.958 align:start position:0%
quick fit stuff but it it's certainly
 
05:10:17.430 --> 05:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
when you look at knee bracing and a
 
05:10:19.230 --> 05:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
little bit of the higher end things it
 
05:10:20.868 --> 05:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
does take money out of out of the
 
05:10:20.878 --> 05:10:22.350 align:start position:0%
does take money out of out of the
business

05:10:22.350 --> 05:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
business
 
05:10:26.430 --> 05:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
but other questions representative Paz
 
05:10:28.910 --> 05:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
off thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:10:32.310 --> 05:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question so sometimes we need
 
05:10:36.510 --> 05:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
to consider effectiveness of uh
 
05:10:40.390 --> 05:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
intervention and I wonder how effective
 
05:10:44.230 --> 05:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
your devices because sometimes we spend
 
05:10:46.788 --> 05:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
money on things that are not very
 
05:10:49.590 --> 05:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
effective like the state uh was spending
 
05:10:52.708 --> 05:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
still spending money to advertise covid
 
05:10:54.548 --> 05:10:54.558 align:start position:0%
vaccine to stop the transmission of
 
05:10:57.350 --> 05:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
covid virus but it doesn't stop so you
 
05:10:59.310 --> 05:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there are some
 
05:11:02.270 --> 05:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
alignments and followups with
 
05:11:05.110 --> 05:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
prosthetics so if there's alignments it
 
05:11:09.310 --> 05:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
means that uh it was not effective so uh
 
05:11:13.590 --> 05:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
or was it effective so is what
 
05:11:15.548 --> 05:11:15.558 align:start position:0%
what what
 
05:11:18.788 --> 05:11:18.798 align:start position:0%
the yeah could you speak to the Quality
 
05:11:21.110 --> 05:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
sure that's a great question so when we
 
05:11:22.750 --> 05:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
see uh
 
05:11:25.350 --> 05:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
amput um a lot of times they're walking
 
05:11:27.548 --> 05:11:27.558 align:start position:0%
for the first time so basically we're
 
05:11:30.590 --> 05:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
fitting a device uh customade device so
 
05:11:32.750 --> 05:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
when you fit a socket to someone that's
 
05:11:35.430 --> 05:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
missing a limb uh that limb is going to
 
05:11:38.830 --> 05:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
change so it's not going to be the same
 
05:11:41.230 --> 05:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
two weeks later so they might have a
 
05:11:43.910 --> 05:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
different thrust to the way they walk
 
05:11:45.110 --> 05:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
and so part
 
05:11:46.948 --> 05:11:46.958 align:start position:0%
of I don't want to go down the whole
 
05:11:49.390 --> 05:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
billing problem with o andp but because
 
05:11:52.110 --> 05:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
you're paid on a lump sum for that
 
05:11:54.750 --> 05:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
device all those follow-ups go with that
 
05:11:57.390 --> 05:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
visit so for a brace like Samantha said
 
05:11:59.070 --> 05:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
it might be two or three visits for a
 
05:12:01.030 --> 05:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up they might have a a spot that
 
05:12:02.708 --> 05:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
it rubs because it's custommade they
 
05:12:04.510 --> 05:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
might have some volume fluctuation or
 
05:12:06.190 --> 05:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
something like that and you might need
 
05:12:07.990 --> 05:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
to heat or pad that device and that's
 
05:12:10.110 --> 05:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
part of that original payment we're not
 
05:12:13.510 --> 05:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
charging that again so in a pris it's
 
05:12:16.470 --> 05:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
very common for someone to change the
 
05:12:18.350 --> 05:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
way they walk as they get used to
 
05:12:19.590 --> 05:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
something and so you would need to
 
05:12:21.590 --> 05:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
realign it and that's part of that
 
05:12:23.670 --> 05:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
followup and with prosthetic patients
 
05:12:25.788 --> 05:12:25.798 align:start position:0%
you know like Samantha mentioned
 
05:12:28.310 --> 05:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes we see people six seven times
 
05:12:30.070 --> 05:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
during that period of
 
05:12:32.150 --> 05:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
care uh you know as they're getting used
 
05:12:34.350 --> 05:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
to that device and that's part of that
 
05:12:34.360 --> 05:12:35.750 align:start position:0%
to that device and that's part of that
original

05:12:35.750 --> 05:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
original
 
05:12:39.470 --> 05:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
payment okay uh representative mlan
 
05:12:41.470 --> 05:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so just to follow up
 
05:12:43.868 --> 05:12:43.878 align:start position:0%
on that then so she was saying that the
 
05:12:45.990 --> 05:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
the hardware itself just the hardware
 
05:12:50.350 --> 05:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
was $500 so your actual cost for the
 
05:12:52.948 --> 05:12:52.958 align:start position:0%
whole deal then factoring all this in
 
05:12:55.350 --> 05:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
you're getting reimbursed you said
 
05:12:58.030 --> 05:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
$524 but what is your total cost you
 
05:12:59.868 --> 05:12:59.878 align:start position:0%
know in terms of not just the hardware
 
05:13:02.030 --> 05:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
but just to give me a feel for where
 
05:13:03.510 --> 05:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
you're at right and and we thanks for
 
05:13:05.150 --> 05:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
the question we'd be happy to send you
 
05:13:07.070 --> 05:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
that that spreadsheet as well because
 
05:13:08.670 --> 05:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
what that did was we broke down our
 
05:13:11.350 --> 05:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
costs to basically what it costs for an
 
05:13:13.628 --> 05:13:13.638 align:start position:0%
hour of my time including the overhead
 
05:13:15.470 --> 05:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
of the office including Samantha
 
05:13:17.910 --> 05:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
including our two front desk people
 
05:13:19.430 --> 05:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
including the fabrication we tried to
 
05:13:22.670 --> 05:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
narrow that down and and put a general
 
05:13:26.190 --> 05:13:26.200 align:start position:0%
um you know cost to each 45 minute
 
05:13:28.510 --> 05:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
interaction and I think we came up with
 
05:13:32.390 --> 05:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
about a $200 an hour you know so if I'm
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
seeing some for 30 minutes that's an
 
05:13:36.708 --> 05:13:36.718 align:start position:0%
extra $100 that would be added on so if
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
I saw them for fitting and I saw or
 
05:13:40.310 --> 05:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
valuation and fitting so you're you're
 
05:13:43.270 --> 05:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
talking about another1 to $150 of just
 
05:13:47.310 --> 05:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
time on top of that cost of that device
 
05:13:47.320 --> 05:13:48.990 align:start position:0%
time on top of that cost of that device
yeah

05:13:48.990 --> 05:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:13:51.230 --> 05:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
follow that's like
 
05:13:51.240 --> 05:13:53.390 align:start position:0%
follow that's like
seven

05:13:53.390 --> 05:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
seven
 
05:13:59.868 --> 05:13:59.878 align:start position:0%
600 on top could be yes yeah other
 
05:14:04.150 --> 05:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you thank
 
05:14:07.310 --> 05:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
you I just have to clarify uh Michael
 
05:14:09.868 --> 05:14:09.878 align:start position:0%
Bradley you signed up for 290 5 I think
 
05:14:12.350 --> 05:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
you I'm assuming you mean 495 is that
 
05:14:15.510 --> 05:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
correct yes excuse me Mr chair 495 okay
 
05:14:17.548 --> 05:14:17.558 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll call on you in a few minutes
 
05:14:20.150 --> 05:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
um but um I have no one else signed up
 
05:14:24.230 --> 05:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
to testify on 455 FN uh Christina could
 
05:14:26.390 --> 05:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
you tell me how many I'm sorry to brag
 
05:14:33.150 --> 05:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:36.868 --> 05:14:36.878 align:start position:0%
sheet when in favor okay thank you I
 
05:14:38.830 --> 05:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
don't know how many signed up online but
 
05:14:40.590 --> 05:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh obviously that's available if anyone
 
05:14:43.150 --> 05:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
wants to find out I'm going to close the
 
05:14:47.590 --> 05:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing on SB 455 FN at this
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
time sorry representative Shapiro thank
 
05:14:52.990 --> 05:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I I would just like to ask
 
05:14:56.030 --> 05:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
that um questions that are irrelevant to
 
05:14:58.430 --> 05:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
the bill that we're talking about um
 
05:15:00.510 --> 05:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
specifically the reference to covid
 
05:15:04.070 --> 05:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines um be reigned in um not only
 
05:15:06.590 --> 05:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
are they not relevant to the bill we're
 
05:15:09.670 --> 05:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
talking about but I think there's
 
05:15:11.548 --> 05:15:11.558 align:start position:0%
you know I I I know there's difference
 
05:15:13.548 --> 05:15:13.558 align:start position:0%
of opinion but many of us feel they're
 
05:15:15.150 --> 05:15:15.160 align:start position:0%
grossly inacurate he did kind of shift
 
05:15:17.548 --> 05:15:17.558 align:start position:0%
his question more to a more relevant
 
05:15:19.510 --> 05:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
stage but I understand what you're
 
05:15:19.520 --> 05:15:21.430 align:start position:0%
stage but I understand what you're
saying

05:15:21.430 --> 05:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
saying
 
05:15:24.948 --> 05:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
um okay um again I'm closing the public
 
05:15:28.590 --> 05:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
hearing on S SP 455 FN it is after 2:30
 
05:15:29.830 --> 05:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
so we're going to open the public
 
05:15:33.430 --> 05:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on S sp495 FN and recognize the
 
05:15:36.470 --> 05:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor Senator Carson uh who's
 
05:15:38.990 --> 05:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
not only uh the majority leader of the
 
05:15:41.350 --> 05:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
Senate but my Senator so welcome Senator
 
05:15:43.830 --> 05:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
harison good afternoon Mr chair good
 
05:15:46.110 --> 05:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chairman and good afternoon
 
05:15:48.150 --> 05:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
members of the House Health and Human
 
05:15:50.430 --> 05:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
Services committee for the record my
 
05:15:52.230 --> 05:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
name is Sharon Carson and I have the
 
05:15:54.948 --> 05:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
pleasure to represent Senate District 14
 
05:15:56.830 --> 05:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
comprising the towns of Auburn London
 
05:15:59.070 --> 05:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
Derry and Hudson and I have for your
 
05:16:01.430 --> 05:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
consideration this afternoon Senate Bill
 
05:16:04.350 --> 05:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
495 which is relative to certification
 
05:16:07.708 --> 05:16:07.718 align:start position:0%
of Alcohol and Other Drug use uh drug
 
05:16:10.030 --> 05:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
use treatment facilities
 
05:16:13.150 --> 05:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
um I think we all know that our uh
 
05:16:15.230 --> 05:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment system has grown
 
05:16:18.030 --> 05:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
exponentially over the last decade
 
05:16:20.030 --> 05:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
thanks to the hard work of many
 
05:16:22.830 --> 05:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
thousands of individuals now receive
 
05:16:25.110 --> 05:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
Treatment Services each day from dozens
 
05:16:26.390 --> 05:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
of Provider
 
05:16:28.670 --> 05:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
organizations we want to believe that
 
05:16:30.830 --> 05:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
all of our treatment providers offers
 
05:16:33.628 --> 05:16:33.638 align:start position:0%
offers the best quality and the highest
 
05:16:36.948 --> 05:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
quality Treatment available but many do
 
05:16:39.350 --> 05:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
but quite frankly in fact
 
05:16:42.150 --> 05:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
we really don't know for sure individual
 
05:16:44.708 --> 05:16:44.718 align:start position:0%
practitioners are licensed as our
 
05:16:46.990 --> 05:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
residential treatment facilities but the
 
05:16:49.030 --> 05:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
fact is the vast majority of Outpatient
 
05:16:51.708 --> 05:16:51.718 align:start position:0%
Treatment organizations do not register
 
05:16:54.350 --> 05:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
with the state in any way because of
 
05:16:56.788 --> 05:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
this lack of oversight we don't know who
 
05:16:59.110 --> 05:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
these treatment organizations are or
 
05:17:01.628 --> 05:17:01.638 align:start position:0%
where they operate and we surely can't
 
05:17:03.670 --> 05:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
be sure that they all adhere to the best
 
05:17:06.868 --> 05:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
practice and follow evidence-based
 
05:17:09.708 --> 05:17:09.718 align:start position:0%
practices at A Min minimum this leads to
 
05:17:12.990 --> 05:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
a wide range of quality of treatment
 
05:17:15.030 --> 05:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
services available to individuals in
 
05:17:17.868 --> 05:17:17.878 align:start position:0%
need at worst it can leave the door open
 
05:17:20.590 --> 05:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
to abuse and misconduct by some of our
 
05:17:22.990 --> 05:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
lesser treatment providers which can
 
05:17:25.430 --> 05:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
weaken our entire treatment system and
 
05:17:27.990 --> 05:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
aggravate the challenges facing some of
 
05:17:31.190 --> 05:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
our most vulnerable friends family and
 
05:17:34.070 --> 05:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
neighbors Senate Bill 495 looks to
 
05:17:35.788 --> 05:17:35.798 align:start position:0%
address this lack of oversight and
 
05:17:38.350 --> 05:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
strengthen patient protection in two
 
05:17:38.360 --> 05:17:39.430 align:start position:0%
strengthen patient protection in two
ways

05:17:39.430 --> 05:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
ways
 
05:17:40.830 --> 05:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
first it would ask the Department of
 
05:17:42.750 --> 05:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to develop a
 
05:17:45.670 --> 05:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
certification system for our Outpatient
 
05:17:47.948 --> 05:17:47.958 align:start position:0%
Treatment providers so the state has a
 
05:17:50.708 --> 05:17:50.718 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive record of which
 
05:17:53.350 --> 05:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
organizations are providing treatment in
 
05:17:56.230 --> 05:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
our state and has a tool to ensure that
 
05:17:58.110 --> 05:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
they are sticking to best practice and
 
05:18:00.030 --> 05:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
providing patients with the services
 
05:18:02.788 --> 05:18:02.798 align:start position:0%
they need secondly it would strengthen
 
05:18:05.030 --> 05:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
lines of reporting misconduct by
 
05:18:07.510 --> 05:18:07.520 align:start position:0%

specifically receiving investigating and
 
05:18:18.030 --> 05:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
addressing allegations of
 
05:18:20.708 --> 05:18:20.718 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing certainly the the current
 
05:18:24.230 --> 05:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's office in within DHS does it
 
05:18:27.868 --> 05:18:27.878 align:start position:0%
all and can address allegation but still
 
05:18:30.430 --> 05:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
a culture of Silence exists within the

the bill in a way that makes it
 
05:18:52.548 --> 05:18:52.558 align:start position:0%
impactful and workable for the
 
05:18:54.990 --> 05:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
Department in its current form we
 
05:18:57.190 --> 05:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
believe it will go far to lift up our
 
05:18:59.628 --> 05:18:59.638 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment Network and
 
05:19:01.628 --> 05:19:01.638 align:start position:0%

05:19:14.590 --> 05:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
state overcome the ongoing addiction
 
05:19:17.070 --> 05:19:17.080 align:start position:0%

defer to them I for some well some
 
05:19:46.510 --> 05:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
reason I had a bill at 2 230 and 3 and
 
05:19:49.190 --> 05:19:49.200 align:start position:0%

Services good afternoon I'm Jenny O
 
05:20:32.390 --> 05:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
Higgins I'm a senior policy Analyst at
 
05:20:35.350 --> 05:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
DHHS for Behavioral Health um Senator
 
05:20:37.948 --> 05:20:37.958 align:start position:0%
Carson was able able to cover very much
 
05:20:40.670 --> 05:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
of my similar comments as she mentioned
 
05:20:43.230 --> 05:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
we have worked closely with the Senate
 
05:20:45.350 --> 05:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
committees in order to get the bill to a
 
05:20:49.270 --> 05:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
place um where it it needs to be so in
 
05:20:51.230 --> 05:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
its initial iteration there were a
 
05:20:53.190 --> 05:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
couple of um specific technical
 
05:20:54.990 --> 05:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
challenges that we have worked out
 
05:20:57.670 --> 05:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
throughout that process and been able to
 
05:21:00.270 --> 05:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that the bill will be workable
 
05:21:02.190 --> 05:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
um we are looking forward to engaging
 
05:21:04.310 --> 05:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
already in Ru making with some of the
 
05:21:05.990 --> 05:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
treatment providers we've begun
 
05:21:08.390 --> 05:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
conversations with them as mentioned
 
05:21:10.708 --> 05:21:10.718 align:start position:0%
there is you know oversight of
 
05:21:13.990 --> 05:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
individual clinicians through oplc um
 
05:21:16.150 --> 05:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
and the um budman's office in its
 
05:21:18.990 --> 05:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
current form um provides protection for
 
05:21:22.190 --> 05:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
all those programs under DHHS however we
 
05:21:25.230 --> 05:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
have you know 65 outpatient substance
 
05:21:27.350 --> 05:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
use providers um registered with
 
05:21:30.830 --> 05:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and of those we contract with
 
05:21:33.750 --> 05:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
um only nine uh as the Bureau of drug
 
05:21:36.190 --> 05:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
and alcohol services and so in its
 
05:21:39.310 --> 05:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
original form this the part of the bill
 
05:21:41.948 --> 05:21:41.958 align:start position:0%
that allows DHHS to do a certification
 
05:21:43.830 --> 05:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
of those outpatient facilities
 
05:21:46.150 --> 05:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
specifically tied it to if we have
 
05:21:48.750 --> 05:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
funding with them and so that is a very
 
05:21:50.708 --> 05:21:50.718 align:start position:0%
small number of those that we know to be
 
05:21:53.030 --> 05:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
out in the community in existence so
 
05:21:55.190 --> 05:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
this bill does allow the certification
 
05:21:57.708 --> 05:21:57.718 align:start position:0%
broadly to look at all of the Outpatient
 
05:22:00.708 --> 05:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
Treatment and look at its quality um and
 
05:22:02.590 --> 05:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
be able to have that that certification
 
05:22:05.430 --> 05:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
piece in place um and make sure that
 
05:22:07.150 --> 05:22:07.160 align:start position:0%
we're not duplicating the efforts that
 
05:22:10.030 --> 05:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
already exist under licens
 
05:22:12.310 --> 05:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank
 
05:22:17.030 --> 05:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:19.470 --> 05:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you for taking my question
 
05:22:20.830 --> 05:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
because I'm really
 
05:22:24.430 --> 05:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
bewildered um because as I
 
05:22:27.030 --> 05:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
read what's in front of
 
05:22:31.868 --> 05:22:31.878 align:start position:0%
me um I'm having a hard time
 
05:22:35.510 --> 05:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
understanding where exactly it's
 
05:22:38.948 --> 05:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
saying what we're doing
 
05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
you said the stuff that this is in
 
05:22:42.990 --> 05:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
addition to stuff that's already
 
05:22:46.510 --> 05:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
licensed but if I look at the way it's
 
05:22:50.270 --> 05:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
the bill is drafted on lines 8 through
 
05:22:54.948 --> 05:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
11 uh what is already in statute is a
 
05:22:57.910 --> 05:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
certification and licensing appears to
 
05:23:01.070 --> 05:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
be new because it's what the the the
 
05:23:05.270 --> 05:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
additional language is is or licensed by
 
05:23:09.070 --> 05:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
so this is a new license and what I'm
 
05:23:11.350 --> 05:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
having a hard time
 
05:23:11.360 --> 05:23:12.990 align:start position:0%
having a hard time
understanding

05:23:12.990 --> 05:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
05:23:13.000 --> 05:23:14.548 align:start position:0%
understanding
is

05:23:14.548 --> 05:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:23:17.990 --> 05:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's it says licensed
 
05:23:21.910 --> 05:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
under rules adopted pursuant to 541a
 
05:23:23.350 --> 05:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
well that's just the administrative
 
05:23:26.750 --> 05:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
procedures act so that's Ru making but
 
05:23:30.110 --> 05:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say where the requirement of
 
05:23:32.590 --> 05:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
the license comes from and I assume that
 
05:23:36.990 --> 05:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
the license should be coming from 172
 
05:23:40.670 --> 05:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
colon 2A but but I'm just not
 
05:23:43.510 --> 05:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
understanding how this licensing works
 
05:23:47.350 --> 05:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
or exactly which kind of uh facilities
 
05:23:50.548 --> 05:23:50.558 align:start position:0%
were talking about and I'm sorry for my
 
05:23:53.230 --> 05:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
ignorance but I'm guessing that I've had
 
05:23:54.788 --> 05:23:54.798 align:start position:0%
I have that problem maybe some other
 
05:23:56.750 --> 05:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
people here do too absolutely thank you
 
05:23:58.510 --> 05:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
for asking so your explanation would be
 
05:24:00.628 --> 05:24:00.638 align:start position:0%
very helpful absolutely so in the
 
05:24:02.430 --> 05:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
section that you're referring
 
05:24:06.190 --> 05:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
to the lines 8 through 11 is talking
 
05:24:07.990 --> 05:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
about the definition of a certified
 
05:24:10.310 --> 05:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
substance abuse treatment facility so
 
05:24:12.948 --> 05:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
what we're saying here is that
 
05:24:16.190 --> 05:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
previously it had been defined including
 
05:24:18.390 --> 05:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
funding in part or in whole by the
 
05:24:20.910 --> 05:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
office of drug and abuse alcohol and
 
05:24:22.708 --> 05:24:22.718 align:start position:0%
drug abuse really now known as the
 
05:24:25.548 --> 05:24:25.558 align:start position:0%
Bureau of drug and alcohol abuse so the
 
05:24:28.470 --> 05:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
um if you had that funding we could
 
05:24:33.150 --> 05:24:33.160 align:start position:0%
certify you because only nine facilities
 
05:24:35.628 --> 05:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
receive that funding and we know there
 
05:24:38.430 --> 05:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
to be 65 that are just Medicaid enrolled
 
05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
we don't know the landscape of those
 
05:24:41.830 --> 05:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
that are not Medicaid enrolled and they
 
05:24:44.310 --> 05:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
of those 65 there's over 100 locations
 
05:24:45.788 --> 05:24:45.798 align:start position:0%
right so we know there to be a substance
 
05:24:48.070 --> 05:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
use landscape for which we are unable to
 
05:24:50.590 --> 05:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
certify so this bill would allow for us
 
05:24:52.910 --> 05:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
to certify more broadly what we're
 
05:24:56.190 --> 05:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
including in here is not um a new
 
05:24:58.910 --> 05:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
license why we added or licens means
 
05:25:00.990 --> 05:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
that the certification that we're
 
05:25:03.390 --> 05:25:03.400 align:start position:0%
looking to add here for outpatient Would
 
05:25:05.548 --> 05:25:05.558 align:start position:0%
Not Duplicate those facilities that are
 
05:25:09.030 --> 05:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
already licensed under 151 so that's the
 
05:25:11.708 --> 05:25:11.718 align:start position:0%
the rule making is of our licensing unit
 
05:25:14.350 --> 05:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
is 151 and that it would include
 
05:25:16.910 --> 05:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
residential substance use treatment so
 
05:25:18.470 --> 05:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
residential substance use treatment
 
05:25:21.190 --> 05:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
already has that oversight certification
 
05:25:23.548 --> 05:25:23.558 align:start position:0%
would be for the outpatient and by
 
05:25:26.110 --> 05:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
definition we're saying that both would
 
05:25:28.750 --> 05:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
be considered if if you're licensed
 
05:25:31.270 --> 05:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
you're exempt from certification but
 
05:25:34.910 --> 05:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
talking about across our substance use
 
05:25:36.910 --> 05:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
um treatment
 
05:25:39.628 --> 05:25:39.638 align:start position:0%
Continuum we would be talking about them
 
05:25:41.910 --> 05:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
as licensed or certified because this
 
05:25:44.110 --> 05:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
allows you to have to not have to get a
 
05:25:45.510 --> 05:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
certification if you're already licensed
 
05:25:49.070 --> 05:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
under a residential rules so follow what
 
05:25:51.708 --> 05:25:51.718 align:start position:0%
could I ask why my why it doesn't say
 
05:25:53.430 --> 05:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
that I mean it would be very helpful to
 
05:25:56.350 --> 05:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
me if it actually said and I'm not
 
05:25:58.750 --> 05:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
trying to make things more complicated
 
05:26:01.788 --> 05:26:01.798 align:start position:0%
and maybe I'm just being
 
05:26:04.470 --> 05:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
particularly thick about a process that
 
05:26:09.868 --> 05:26:09.878 align:start position:0%
I I just don't understand but um
 
05:26:12.788 --> 05:26:12.798 align:start position:0%
I'm still very literally looking at the
 
05:26:15.110 --> 05:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
words that are on the page and you use a
 
05:26:16.708 --> 05:26:16.718 align:start position:0%
different vocabulary when you're
 
05:26:20.990 --> 05:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
explaining it to me um this is adding
 
05:26:23.990 --> 05:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
the licensing language to just the
 
05:26:26.350 --> 05:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
definitional piece but on page two line
 
05:26:28.548 --> 05:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
two you'll see that it says that those
 
05:26:30.310 --> 05:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
that are that you wouldn't need a
 
05:26:32.510 --> 05:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
certification includes facilities liced
 
05:26:34.110 --> 05:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
05:26:37.670 --> 05:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
151 okay thank you and why is that
 
05:26:39.708 --> 05:26:39.718 align:start position:0%
language not also
 
05:26:42.628 --> 05:26:42.638 align:start position:0%
included upfront in in in the
 
05:26:44.708 --> 05:26:44.718 align:start position:0%
definitional part when you go and
 
05:26:47.230 --> 05:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
reference and it not that it can't be if
 
05:26:49.110 --> 05:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
that would clarify this issue but when
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
you look at where we use the terminology
 
05:26:53.310 --> 05:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
of certified substance abuse treatment
 
05:26:55.670 --> 05:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
facility throughout the rest of the RSA
 
05:26:57.548 --> 05:26:57.558 align:start position:0%
we thought that the definition needed to
 
05:26:59.708 --> 05:26:59.718 align:start position:0%
be inclusive of those that are licensed
 
05:27:01.390 --> 05:27:01.400 align:start position:0%
because they also already have the
 
05:27:03.470 --> 05:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
additional oversite okay so the
 
05:27:05.430 --> 05:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
definitional change is just including
 
05:27:07.310 --> 05:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
that if you are certified or licensed
 
05:27:09.310 --> 05:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
you are cons Ed a certified substance
 
05:27:11.070 --> 05:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
beuse treatment facility okay
 
05:27:12.750 --> 05:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
essentially you would be considered
 
05:27:14.948 --> 05:27:14.958 align:start position:0%
certified by having a license right so
 
05:27:16.670 --> 05:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
that those certification and licensure
 
05:27:19.470 --> 05:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
would be okay thank you very much and
 
05:27:21.150 --> 05:27:21.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for walking me through that
 
05:27:22.788 --> 05:27:22.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative kofalt would
 
05:27:24.910 --> 05:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up thank you Mr
 
05:27:26.150 --> 05:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
05:27:29.070 --> 05:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
question so
 
05:27:32.990 --> 05:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
um do you have statistics showing sort
 
05:27:35.708 --> 05:27:35.718 align:start position:0%
of the the the problem with the current
 
05:27:39.190 --> 05:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
system so we've heard several mention
 
05:27:41.910 --> 05:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
of patient safety or the need for
 
05:27:41.920 --> 05:27:43.470 align:start position:0%
of patient safety or the need for
scientific

05:27:43.470 --> 05:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
scientific
 
05:27:46.470 --> 05:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
approaches um what's wrong with the
 
05:27:48.270 --> 05:27:48.280 align:start position:0%
current system and do you have
 
05:27:50.670 --> 05:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
statistics that can support that
 
05:27:53.390 --> 05:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
assertion I think that you'll hear more
 
05:27:56.190 --> 05:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
about the gaps in oversight from our
 
05:27:58.110 --> 05:27:58.120 align:start position:0%
Advocates and treatment providers that
 
05:28:00.150 --> 05:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
are here to speak to that today because
 
05:28:02.948 --> 05:28:02.958 align:start position:0%
DHHS does not currently have oversight
 
05:28:05.510 --> 05:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
of those facilities we would not be
 
05:28:10.590 --> 05:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:12.868 --> 05:28:12.878 align:start position:0%
so you would not be receiving complaints
 
05:28:14.590 --> 05:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
about them is what you're saying we
 
05:28:16.070 --> 05:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
don't have any oversight over the
 
05:28:18.190 --> 05:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
outpatient facilities except for those
 
05:28:21.510 --> 05:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
whom with we con we we fund okay today
 
05:28:23.948 --> 05:28:23.958 align:start position:0%
and so we would not have the information
 
05:28:27.270 --> 05:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
about those gaps in Services okay this
 
05:28:31.150 --> 05:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
is meant to correct that thank you um
 
05:28:35.190 --> 05:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
so if there are if if the goal is
 
05:28:38.788 --> 05:28:38.798 align:start position:0%
to get oversight of services that you
 
05:28:40.948 --> 05:28:40.958 align:start position:0%
are not
 
05:28:43.190 --> 05:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
currently um
 
05:28:46.190 --> 05:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
funding how far does this reach and I I
 
05:28:47.750 --> 05:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
I sort of read the definition of a
 
05:28:49.948 --> 05:28:49.958 align:start position:0%
facility and it it feels like a circular
 
05:28:55.270 --> 05:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
definition so um is the local AA group
 
05:28:57.548 --> 05:28:57.558 align:start position:0%
that meets in the church basement now
 
05:29:02.190 --> 05:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
required to be certified by DHHS is a
 
05:29:06.110 --> 05:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
local church group or or church facility
 
05:29:08.830 --> 05:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
that's providing some kind of um um
 
05:29:11.708 --> 05:29:11.718 align:start position:0%
services for people with substance abuse
 
05:29:14.948 --> 05:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
problems going now subject to DHHS um
 
05:29:16.868 --> 05:29:16.878 align:start position:0%
oversight so this is for clinical
 
05:29:18.788 --> 05:29:18.798 align:start position:0%
treatment so what you've described I
 
05:29:21.510 --> 05:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
would I would call recovery
 
05:29:23.830 --> 05:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
supports so this treat this would be for
 
05:29:25.548 --> 05:29:25.558 align:start position:0%
clinical treatment under substance
 
05:29:27.470 --> 05:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder treatment for
 
05:29:28.830 --> 05:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
outpatient so it would include
 
05:29:31.270 --> 05:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
outpatient facilities uh intensive
 
05:29:33.150 --> 05:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
outpatient facilities and partial
 
05:29:35.430 --> 05:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
hospitalization programs those levels of
 
05:29:39.070 --> 05:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
care defined by the ASM criteria area
 
05:29:41.510 --> 05:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
that are not residential and the reason
 
05:29:42.910 --> 05:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
not residential is because they're
 
05:29:42.920 --> 05:29:44.470 align:start position:0%
not residential is because they're
already

05:29:44.470 --> 05:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:29:46.868 --> 05:29:46.878 align:start position:0%
licensed uh representative Shapero and
 
05:29:48.868 --> 05:29:48.878 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
05:29:51.150 --> 05:29:51.160 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:29:54.910 --> 05:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
for taking this question um on page 2
 
05:29:58.070 --> 05:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
line 20 it says the commissioner May
 
05:30:00.270 --> 05:30:00.280 align:start position:0%
accept gifts grants donations and other
 
05:30:03.910 --> 05:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
funding for from any source and shall
 
05:30:06.910 --> 05:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
deposit those all such Revenue received
 
05:30:10.110 --> 05:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
into the fund to do these
 
05:30:12.510 --> 05:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
certifications do I take that to mean
 
05:30:16.070 --> 05:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
that this program of certifying
 
05:30:16.080 --> 05:30:17.590 align:start position:0%
that this program of certifying
these

05:30:17.590 --> 05:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:30:21.070 --> 05:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
um these Services is going to be reliant
 
05:30:21.080 --> 05:30:23.948 align:start position:0%
um these Services is going to be reliant
on

05:30:23.948 --> 05:30:23.958 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:30:26.030 --> 05:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
donations I believe that that is
 
05:30:28.150 --> 05:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
standard language for the creation of a
 
05:30:30.070 --> 05:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
fund I would have to ask our finance
 
05:30:32.230 --> 05:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
director but that is Who provided the
 
05:30:34.390 --> 05:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
language for the fund and so I believe
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
that this is standard language for when
 
05:30:38.190 --> 05:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
we create a fund in our statute and I'm
 
05:30:39.628 --> 05:30:39.638 align:start position:0%
happy to go back and make sure I have
 
05:30:43.788 --> 05:30:43.798 align:start position:0%
that answer correct but the um fees
 
05:30:47.310 --> 05:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
would help to pay for the certification
 
05:30:50.230 --> 05:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
longer term we would need staff to
 
05:30:51.990 --> 05:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
implement this which is why the bill
 
05:30:53.948 --> 05:30:53.958 align:start position:0%
does call out you know with sufficient
 
05:30:55.510 --> 05:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
funding that we would be able to
 
05:30:55.520 --> 05:30:58.070 align:start position:0%
funding that we would be able to
implement

05:30:58.070 --> 05:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
implement
 
05:31:01.230 --> 05:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
certification thank you followup follow
 
05:31:03.750 --> 05:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
um yes I would appreciate that makes
 
05:31:05.230 --> 05:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
sense to me if it's just standard
 
05:31:07.190 --> 05:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
language but I would I would be
 
05:31:09.948 --> 05:31:09.958 align:start position:0%
interested in learning about that um the
 
05:31:13.788 --> 05:31:13.798 align:start position:0%
other thing question I have is um the
 
05:31:15.868 --> 05:31:15.878 align:start position:0%
position of the
 
05:31:18.830 --> 05:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman I wonder how that would be
 
05:31:21.670 --> 05:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
integrated with the oversight by
 
05:31:23.910 --> 05:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
licensing boards
 
05:31:26.990 --> 05:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
so if you got a complaint about a
 
05:31:27.000 --> 05:31:28.948 align:start position:0%
so if you got a complaint about a
particular

05:31:28.948 --> 05:31:28.958 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:31:31.270 --> 05:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
organization and the clinicians who are
 
05:31:33.910 --> 05:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
working in that organization but maybe
 
05:31:36.190 --> 05:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
they're licensed social workers or
 
05:31:38.708 --> 05:31:38.718 align:start position:0%
licensed substance Mis
 
05:31:40.948 --> 05:31:40.958 align:start position:0%
clinicians how would
 
05:31:45.230 --> 05:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
the um boards at oplc and the
 
05:31:48.310 --> 05:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman office work together or would
 
05:31:51.788 --> 05:31:51.798 align:start position:0%
they yes our current licensing and udman
 
05:31:54.070 --> 05:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
offices do already interact with
 
05:31:56.548 --> 05:31:56.558 align:start position:0%
oversight boards so they there is a
 
05:31:58.548 --> 05:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
relationship that's already established
 
05:32:00.750 --> 05:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
this this position is just added to our
 
05:32:02.868 --> 05:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
existing Ombudsman so they would
 
05:32:05.310 --> 05:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
continue to follow best practices as
 
05:32:07.548 --> 05:32:07.558 align:start position:0%
they do today but it would the position
 
05:32:09.830 --> 05:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
would have some expertise or training
 
05:32:11.910 --> 05:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
specific to the behavioral health field
 
05:32:13.670 --> 05:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
so they would share
 
05:32:16.510 --> 05:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
information wherever legally possible or
 
05:32:21.510 --> 05:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
where necessary yes is representative uh
 
05:32:24.190 --> 05:32:24.200 align:start position:0%
Merchant sorry
 
05:32:27.510 --> 05:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you M sigin for taking the
 
05:32:30.670 --> 05:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
question I understand the facility but
 
05:32:33.868 --> 05:32:33.878 align:start position:0%
that's really kind of a building um so
 
05:32:35.350 --> 05:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
the facility doesn't really provide the
 
05:32:38.430 --> 05:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
services clinicians but don't clinicians
 
05:32:40.110 --> 05:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
because of license have boards that are
 
05:32:42.030 --> 05:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
responsible to so isn't there some level
 
05:32:45.310 --> 05:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
of oversight today that oversees the
 
05:32:47.788 --> 05:32:47.798 align:start position:0%
clinicians not the facility but the
 
05:32:49.750 --> 05:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
clinical staff in that facility would
 
05:32:51.708 --> 05:32:51.718 align:start position:0%
they not have some sort of supervision
 
05:32:53.868 --> 05:32:53.878 align:start position:0%
or I understanding there's no
 
05:32:55.590 --> 05:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
supervision by respective licensing
 
05:32:57.948 --> 05:32:57.958 align:start position:0%
boards no they do the existing state
 
05:33:01.910 --> 05:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
regulations through oplc um and through
 
05:33:04.948 --> 05:33:04.958 align:start position:0%
our licensing you know units do help to
 
05:33:07.390 --> 05:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
protect individuals um and to monitor
 
05:33:10.030 --> 05:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
that of care for the clinician and then
 
05:33:12.868 --> 05:33:12.878 align:start position:0%
the piece that licensing our our current
 
05:33:15.110 --> 05:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
licensing would look at the facilities
 
05:33:17.470 --> 05:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
and safety and quality of services and
 
05:33:19.590 --> 05:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
then the the clinicians are still held
 
05:33:22.110 --> 05:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
to the standards from the oplc so we do
 
05:33:25.470 --> 05:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
have this in existing law but we don't
 
05:33:27.590 --> 05:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
have the oversight for just outpatient
 
05:33:29.070 --> 05:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
so we're looking to mimic some of the
 
05:33:32.190 --> 05:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
oversight that exists for
 
05:33:36.350 --> 05:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
residential follow thank you Mr chair so
 
05:33:38.628 --> 05:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
that I'm clear
 
05:33:40.708 --> 05:33:40.718 align:start position:0%
this is looking to like if you go into a
 
05:33:42.670 --> 05:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
hospital my understanding with the
 
05:33:45.788 --> 05:33:45.798 align:start position:0%
hospitals you're looking at the hospital
 
05:33:48.190 --> 05:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
facility it's a facility oversite not so
 
05:33:50.628 --> 05:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
much the clinicians in the facility so
 
05:33:52.030 --> 05:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
therefore you're looking to be sure it
 
05:33:55.190 --> 05:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's clean it's safe and and so forth
 
05:33:57.590 --> 05:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's more of a building certification
 
05:33:59.470 --> 05:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
than it is the clinicians I want to be
 
05:34:00.910 --> 05:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
clear that we're talking about the
 
05:34:03.150 --> 05:34:03.160 align:start position:0%
facility not per se the clinicians
 
05:34:04.670 --> 05:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
because they're actually being overseen
 
05:34:07.750 --> 05:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
by the respective licensing board it it
 
05:34:10.990 --> 05:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
does include in the same in I mean M
 
05:34:13.430 --> 05:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
much of the details will be um worked
 
05:34:15.868 --> 05:34:15.878 align:start position:0%
out through the ru making process but
 
05:34:18.868 --> 05:34:18.878 align:start position:0%
the idea theoretically is to have to
 
05:34:22.110 --> 05:34:22.120 align:start position:0%
look in many ways at RSA 151 in the way
 
05:34:24.948 --> 05:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
that we license residential and so it
 
05:34:26.948 --> 05:34:26.958 align:start position:0%
would not be individual clinicians
 
05:34:29.628 --> 05:34:29.638 align:start position:0%
there's carve out specific for hospitals
 
05:34:31.750 --> 05:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
specifically for those that are are
 
05:34:35.070 --> 05:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
already licensed through residential um
 
05:34:38.030 --> 05:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
and Facilities that you know already
 
05:34:39.510 --> 05:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
have those kinds of oversight our
 
05:34:41.150 --> 05:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
community mental health system things
 
05:34:43.470 --> 05:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
like that so this is for a practice of
 
05:34:45.868 --> 05:34:45.878 align:start position:0%
clinicians and where they're where
 
05:34:47.190 --> 05:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
they're seeing
 
05:34:49.510 --> 05:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
clients Senator Weber thank you for your
 
05:34:51.070 --> 05:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
patience sorry about that that's quite
 
05:34:53.990 --> 05:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
all right um they're they're all good
 
05:34:56.990 --> 05:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
questions so
 
05:35:01.470 --> 05:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
um what I'm trying to understand and my
 
05:35:03.990 --> 05:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
first question comes off of the uh
 
05:35:05.788 --> 05:35:05.798 align:start position:0%
question from representative
 
05:35:08.230 --> 05:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
Shapiro uh if I'm looking
 
05:35:11.310 --> 05:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
on the first page line
 
05:35:14.190 --> 05:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
26 uh and again it's the subject to
 
05:35:16.390 --> 05:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
available funding the the commissioner
 
05:35:18.948 --> 05:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
shall establish personent who
 
05:35:22.670 --> 05:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
rules um the rules that this is going to
 
05:35:25.150 --> 05:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
operate under so if there's no funding
 
05:35:27.910 --> 05:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
not only will will there not there won't
 
05:35:29.030 --> 05:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
be rules and there won't be
 
05:35:31.110 --> 05:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
certification unless there is funding
 
05:35:33.310 --> 05:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
forthcoming in some way that we have not
 
05:35:37.190 --> 05:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
yet defined is that correct yes so
 
05:35:39.030 --> 05:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
initially the you know we've looked at
 
05:35:40.830 --> 05:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
this bill in a couple different
 
05:35:43.868 --> 05:35:43.878 align:start position:0%
iterations and it does require staff for
 
05:35:46.948 --> 05:35:46.958 align:start position:0%
us to then do the certification however
 
05:35:49.910 --> 05:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
we believe that in its current form this
 
05:35:53.110 --> 05:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
bill does allow us to begin the rulem
 
05:35:55.350 --> 05:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
process without adoption of the rules
 
05:35:57.030 --> 05:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
until those positions are in place
 
05:35:59.230 --> 05:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
through the budget year but it allows us
 
05:36:01.230 --> 05:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
to begin to work with stakeholders and
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
with treatment providers to write the
 
05:36:05.230 --> 05:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
rules so that we can figure out some of
 
05:36:07.628 --> 05:36:07.638 align:start position:0%
the real detail work of what the certif
 
05:36:10.230 --> 05:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
ification should include and work with
 
05:36:12.830 --> 05:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
oplc and many of the the licensing unit
 
05:36:14.270 --> 05:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
many of the questions you're asking
 
05:36:16.670 --> 05:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
today it's can we get in the weeds to do
 
05:36:20.030 --> 05:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
that work that may take quite a while
 
05:36:23.150 --> 05:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
and then look at um how to budget for
 
05:36:24.708 --> 05:36:24.718 align:start position:0%
positions that could do the
 
05:36:27.070 --> 05:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
certification okay that's that's making
 
05:36:28.868 --> 05:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
much more sense to me thank you very
 
05:36:31.390 --> 05:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
much for that so the actual positions
 
05:36:33.708 --> 05:36:33.718 align:start position:0%
would then come in the next budget cycle
 
05:36:36.110 --> 05:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
so that one would
 
05:36:38.990 --> 05:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
hope right got it but you but you would
 
05:36:41.030 --> 05:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
have a leg up on being prepared and
 
05:36:43.310 --> 05:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
knowing the scope of what those
 
05:36:45.310 --> 05:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
positions are and what would be needed
 
05:36:48.910 --> 05:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
so if I may have a second completely
 
05:36:51.830 --> 05:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
non-related non-follow-up question we
 
05:36:55.708 --> 05:36:55.718 align:start position:0%
were talking also about the licensing
 
05:36:59.708 --> 05:36:59.718 align:start position:0%
for the folks who actually provide the
 
05:37:03.030 --> 05:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
services which you're doing through oplc
 
05:37:06.430 --> 05:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm noticing on page three on page
 
05:37:11.110 --> 05:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
29 and page 30 the complete
 
05:37:14.708 --> 05:37:14.718 align:start position:0%
repeal of the the definition of
 
05:37:17.510 --> 05:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
certified alcohol and drug abuse
 
05:37:20.510 --> 05:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
counselor and relative to the definition
 
05:37:22.470 --> 05:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
of a designated drug counselor and I
 
05:37:26.708 --> 05:37:26.718 align:start position:0%
haven't looked up those actual statutory
 
05:37:30.230 --> 05:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
sections but are we are we completely
 
05:37:32.750 --> 05:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
doing away with those particular
 
05:37:34.788 --> 05:37:34.798 align:start position:0%
licenses and if
 
05:37:38.750 --> 05:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
so with what are we replacing them
 
05:37:42.390 --> 05:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
so we're just we just simply don't call
 
05:37:45.628 --> 05:37:45.638 align:start position:0%
them that anymore and so the language is
 
05:37:48.190 --> 05:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
Antiquated and so we could replace the
 
05:37:51.390 --> 05:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
language in this RSA with that as that
 
05:37:54.548 --> 05:37:54.558 align:start position:0%
is mimics oplc and what the current real
 
05:37:57.670 --> 05:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
lure is okay so there are other things
 
05:37:59.270 --> 05:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
that supersede that and we're just
 
05:38:01.750 --> 05:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the archaic language
 
05:38:03.948 --> 05:38:03.958 align:start position:0%
exactly okay thank you very
 
05:38:06.990 --> 05:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
much other questions representa
 
05:38:08.548 --> 05:38:08.558 align:start position:0%
representative South
 
05:38:11.190 --> 05:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chair I have two
 
05:38:14.150 --> 05:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
questions about this um my first one is
 
05:38:18.868 --> 05:38:18.878 align:start position:0%
on um page one uh line 8 um to piggy
 
05:38:20.788 --> 05:38:20.798 align:start position:0%
back a little bit on something that was
 
05:38:25.350 --> 05:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:29.150 --> 05:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
um there's two types of you know
 
05:38:31.830 --> 05:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
institutions ones that take government
 
05:38:35.548 --> 05:38:35.558 align:start position:0%
money and then ones that don't and in my
 
05:38:37.548 --> 05:38:37.558 align:start position:0%
understanding this correctly that this
 
05:38:40.110 --> 05:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
is going to allow those who don't want
 
05:38:42.190 --> 05:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
to take government money just you know
 
05:38:44.990 --> 05:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
private organizations from now being
 
05:38:47.270 --> 05:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
labeled as certified substance abuse
 
05:38:49.150 --> 05:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities this is going to
 
05:38:52.190 --> 05:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
have greater buy in for them they yes
 
05:38:54.190 --> 05:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
you would be as a private entity would
 
05:38:57.708 --> 05:38:57.718 align:start position:0%
under this be need to be required to be
 
05:39:00.350 --> 05:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
certified to practice in New
 
05:39:04.510 --> 05:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right well it's it's it's
 
05:39:06.350 --> 05:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
actually I don't know I feel like it's a
 
05:39:08.548 --> 05:39:08.558 align:start position:0%
little bit little bit more than that
 
05:39:10.390 --> 05:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
because now it's basically it's getting
 
05:39:12.350 --> 05:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
it's striking out that part saying that
 
05:39:15.190 --> 05:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's funded in part by or in whole so
 
05:39:18.270 --> 05:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
it's just allowing more facilities to be
 
05:39:22.270 --> 05:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
labeled um they can operate today in New
 
05:39:24.310 --> 05:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with no oversight so this
 
05:39:26.990 --> 05:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
allows the department to certify those
 
05:39:29.468 --> 05:39:29.478 align:start position:0%
agencies that do or do not receive state
 
05:39:32.708 --> 05:39:32.718 align:start position:0%
funding okay um and then my second
 
05:39:35.430 --> 05:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
question is on page three Roman numeral
 
05:39:39.390 --> 05:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
uh Roman numeral 2 um um it it basically
 
05:39:40.830 --> 05:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
also sounds
 
05:39:44.190 --> 05:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
like it is a takeover right because
 
05:39:46.910 --> 05:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to have two types of
 
05:39:48.468 --> 05:39:48.478 align:start position:0%
Institutions let's just say some that
 
05:39:49.830 --> 05:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
are Orthodox and some that are
 
05:39:52.788 --> 05:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
unorthodox maybe the unorthodox ones are
 
05:39:56.390 --> 05:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
religious based or some other way I
 
05:39:57.628 --> 05:39:57.638 align:start position:0%
can't even think of right now but
 
05:39:59.868 --> 05:39:59.878 align:start position:0%
there's different ways of skinning this
 
05:40:01.628 --> 05:40:01.638 align:start position:0%
cat so to speak and it sounds like in
 
05:40:03.510 --> 05:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
order to be able to even continue doing
 
05:40:05.948 --> 05:40:05.958 align:start position:0%
that they're going to have to become
 
05:40:05.958 --> 05:40:07.590 align:start position:0%
that they're going to have to become
orthodox

05:40:07.590 --> 05:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
orthodox
 
05:40:09.590 --> 05:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
um do you see it that
 
05:40:12.230 --> 05:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
way I do not because this is clinical
 
05:40:14.830 --> 05:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
treatment and so there is a practice
 
05:40:16.868 --> 05:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
that needs that to in order to have a
 
05:40:19.590 --> 05:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
high quality of care they just like
 
05:40:22.070 --> 05:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
every other type of Health Care should
 
05:40:25.030 --> 05:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that that quality is high and
 
05:40:27.590 --> 05:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
so therefore I think they would fall
 
05:40:31.070 --> 05:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
within the the rules as written in terms
 
05:40:33.230 --> 05:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
of the way that we currently license
 
05:40:35.510 --> 05:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
facilities and then our certification
 
05:40:39.070 --> 05:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
rules would mimic you criteria set forth
 
05:40:43.628 --> 05:40:43.638 align:start position:0%
by the the federal accreditations and um
 
05:40:46.350 --> 05:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
operations under that ASM criteria so I
 
05:40:48.350 --> 05:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
think it would be asking folks to come
 
05:40:50.868 --> 05:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
up to an appropriate clinical standard
 
05:40:53.030 --> 05:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that people get the care
 
05:40:54.788 --> 05:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
that they
 
05:40:57.070 --> 05:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
deserve I don't know I just I don't
 
05:40:58.830 --> 05:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
fully I guess I'm struggling to wrap my
 
05:41:01.270 --> 05:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
head around it because you've got you if
 
05:41:03.590 --> 05:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
they're not taking any government money
 
05:41:05.190 --> 05:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
um and they currently exist there's
 
05:41:06.670 --> 05:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
currently that system going I don't know
 
05:41:08.110 --> 05:41:08.120 align:start position:0%
it just seems weird to me that all of a
 
05:41:09.830 --> 05:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
sudden now they'd have to become more
 
05:41:11.350 --> 05:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
Orthodox I don't know I'll have to think
 
05:41:14.110 --> 05:41:14.120 align:start position:0%
about it later I think it's it's um if
 
05:41:16.150 --> 05:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
you think about it in terms of of
 
05:41:18.830 --> 05:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
physical health care that there's
 
05:41:20.948 --> 05:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
there's not an orthodox and unorthodox
 
05:41:23.070 --> 05:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
like ways to practice medicine right so
 
05:41:25.628 --> 05:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
it's become making sure that there is
 
05:41:27.910 --> 05:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
that that there's a a standard of
 
05:41:29.548 --> 05:41:29.558 align:start position:0%
quality I'm not sure I agree with that
 
05:41:34.830 --> 05:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:38.910 --> 05:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
McKay your microphone's off thank you Mr
 
05:41:44.030 --> 05:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
chairman um do you have any information
 
05:41:47.670 --> 05:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
about uh people who have been badly
 
05:41:52.350 --> 05:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
treated or inappropriately treated or
 
05:41:55.548 --> 05:41:55.558 align:start position:0%
unscientifically treated I I take it
 
05:42:00.510 --> 05:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
that the purpose of this is to not have
 
05:42:04.350 --> 05:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
people be treated by
 
05:42:07.430 --> 05:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
inappropriate U professions that
 
05:42:10.150 --> 05:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
clinicians I was a licensed clinical
 
05:42:13.510 --> 05:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
social worker the licensing board is
 
05:42:13.520 --> 05:42:14.390 align:start position:0%
social worker the licensing board is
very

05:42:14.390 --> 05:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:42:18.868 --> 05:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
strict and that they often will uh
 
05:42:23.510 --> 05:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
penalize and take away the license of
 
05:42:26.510 --> 05:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
individuals do you have any
 
05:42:29.670 --> 05:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
information about people who have been
 
05:42:32.788 --> 05:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
badly treated there must be some
 
05:42:36.190 --> 05:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
motivation to get this started and I
 
05:42:38.110 --> 05:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
wonder if there's
 
05:42:40.548 --> 05:42:40.558 align:start position:0%
information about how many of our
 
05:42:42.788 --> 05:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
citizens have been
 
05:42:42.798 --> 05:42:44.350 align:start position:0%
citizens have been
inappropriately

05:42:44.350 --> 05:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
inappropriately
 
05:42:46.990 --> 05:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
treated and what happened to those
 
05:42:49.190 --> 05:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
clinicians who did
 
05:42:52.548 --> 05:42:52.558 align:start position:0%
that so this is an issue Across the
 
05:42:54.430 --> 05:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
Nation it's not specific to New
 
05:42:56.510 --> 05:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but and it is specific to New
 
05:42:59.270 --> 05:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right but um but substance use
 
05:43:02.948 --> 05:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
treatment has um long has had a long
 
05:43:05.430 --> 05:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
history of very little oversight and so
 
05:43:07.990 --> 05:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
a very vulnerable population has been
 
05:43:10.030 --> 05:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of in a number of ways I
 
05:43:12.190 --> 05:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
do think you'll again hear more of those
 
05:43:14.390 --> 05:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
examples from some of our treatment
 
05:43:16.548 --> 05:43:16.558 align:start position:0%
providers and advocacy agencies that are
 
05:43:19.230 --> 05:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
here today but because the department is
 
05:43:22.110 --> 05:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
not currently overseeing that outpatient
 
05:43:25.110 --> 05:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
um I do not have those examples do you
 
05:43:27.670 --> 05:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
know follow up follow up do you know who
 
05:43:29.868 --> 05:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
would have that information I think
 
05:43:31.190 --> 05:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
you'll have you know Jake Barry
 
05:43:33.190 --> 05:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
testifying here today that could speak
 
05:43:36.030 --> 05:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
to uh why new Futures you know was
 
05:43:38.510 --> 05:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
working toing bring forward this Bill
 
05:43:41.270 --> 05:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Missour yeah
 
05:43:44.110 --> 05:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:43:45.510 --> 05:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
my question and it was actually a
 
05:43:48.110 --> 05:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
question I had before uh representative
 
05:43:50.350 --> 05:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
King brought up what he did but on page
 
05:43:53.910 --> 05:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
three uh lines 10 through 11 where it
 
05:43:56.310 --> 05:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
says no person may establish maintain
 
05:43:58.708 --> 05:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
operate or conduct any program or
 
05:44:01.350 --> 05:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
facility for substance use treatment dot
 
05:44:03.670 --> 05:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
dot dot but I kept hearing you say
 
05:44:06.030 --> 05:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
before that this is specific to clinical
 
05:44:08.990 --> 05:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
treatment but those that doesn't say
 
05:44:11.030 --> 05:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
that to me for substance use treatment
 
05:44:13.990 --> 05:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's very Broad and more encompassing
 
05:44:18.110 --> 05:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
to me than just clinical treatment so
 
05:44:20.070 --> 05:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
this is that this what I'm struggling
 
05:44:22.190 --> 05:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
with similar to what representative King
 
05:44:25.230 --> 05:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
said that that limits a whole
 
05:44:29.230 --> 05:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
area of of people that help with
 
05:44:32.590 --> 05:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
substance abuse that are not
 
05:44:37.110 --> 05:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
clinically you know they regulated so
 
05:44:39.670 --> 05:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
people that I I believe and I'm just
 
05:44:41.070 --> 05:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
trying to make an assumption to get to
 
05:44:42.590 --> 05:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
the best answer but correct me if I'm
 
05:44:43.590 --> 05:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
wrong but I believe the what you're
 
05:44:45.910 --> 05:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
talking about um was also based on an
 
05:44:48.310 --> 05:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
earlier question around recovery
 
05:44:51.948 --> 05:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
supports like AA and Na and smart
 
05:44:53.310 --> 05:44:53.320 align:start position:0%
recovery and things like that our
 
05:44:55.190 --> 05:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
recovery Community organizations
 
05:44:58.230 --> 05:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
faith-based programs um our recovery
 
05:45:00.468 --> 05:45:00.478 align:start position:0%
supports that are a critical part of the
 
05:45:03.070 --> 05:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
Continuum of Care and are not considered
 
05:45:03.080 --> 05:45:08.190 align:start position:0%
Continuum of Care and are not considered
treatment

05:45:08.190 --> 05:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:08.200 --> 05:45:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:45:09.830 --> 05:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:45:13.110 --> 05:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
Weber so again to try and tease out a
 
05:45:16.150 --> 05:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
little more of this am I right in
 
05:45:19.150 --> 05:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
thinking that right now I could put a
 
05:45:21.948 --> 05:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
sign out at the bottom of my driveway
 
05:45:24.310 --> 05:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
that says
 
05:45:29.310 --> 05:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
Lucy's ice waterer bath substance abuse
 
05:45:31.910 --> 05:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
treatment I don't have any knowledge
 
05:45:33.628 --> 05:45:33.638 align:start position:0%
about whether ice water baths are
 
05:45:37.270 --> 05:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
helpful or not but I could put a sign
 
05:45:40.030 --> 05:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
out and because bathing people in ice
 
05:45:41.390 --> 05:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
water is something that I don't have to
 
05:45:44.150 --> 05:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
have a certificate for of any sort I
 
05:45:46.830 --> 05:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
could just ask people for money
 
05:45:48.948 --> 05:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
particularly desperate people who are
 
05:45:51.430 --> 05:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
desperately looking for a solution and
 
05:45:54.030 --> 05:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
say come to me and have ice water baths
 
05:45:56.548 --> 05:45:56.558 align:start position:0%
because I think that's good for you and
 
05:45:59.110 --> 05:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
there's no regulation now and that's why
 
05:46:02.868 --> 05:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
we need this is that a far-fetched but
 
05:46:06.190 --> 05:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
possible scenario or I know we have seen
 
05:46:09.948 --> 05:46:09.958 align:start position:0%
this in other completely unregulated
 
05:46:14.628 --> 05:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:18.230 --> 05:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm wondering if if if there are
 
05:46:23.110 --> 05:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
examples that could be that extreme so
 
05:46:25.310 --> 05:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
now yeah I'm not sure if I can answer
 
05:46:27.070 --> 05:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
your question I think what we're looking
 
05:46:29.070 --> 05:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
to do with the bill and maybe we can
 
05:46:30.430 --> 05:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
clarify it and that's something that
 
05:46:32.270 --> 05:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be worked out in a future
 
05:46:35.030 --> 05:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
iteration but the idea is to oversee
 
05:46:37.350 --> 05:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
those outpatient substance use treatment
 
05:46:40.510 --> 05:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
facilities that are already um fall
 
05:46:42.948 --> 05:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
within that ASM criteria and the levels
 
05:46:45.548 --> 05:46:45.558 align:start position:0%
of care that are a part of of clinical
 
05:46:48.430 --> 05:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
treatment so my example would be outside
 
05:46:50.948 --> 05:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
even of that yes okay thank you
 
05:46:52.868 --> 05:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
representative Lon uh thank you Mr
 
05:46:54.430 --> 05:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for answering all
 
05:46:56.350 --> 05:46:56.360 align:start position:0%
these detailed questions I have another
 
05:46:59.150 --> 05:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
one for you can you let me know what
 
05:47:02.110 --> 05:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
part of the statutes protect um
 
05:47:04.070 --> 05:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
Alcoholics Anonymous and from other
 
05:47:05.708 --> 05:47:05.718 align:start position:0%
things like this from being impacted
 
05:47:07.390 --> 05:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
from this I know I'm hearing this from
 
05:47:09.990 --> 05:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
you right now but when we get to the
 
05:47:12.430 --> 05:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
rules process and we get to Jael car if
 
05:47:14.310 --> 05:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
you come in with something that ends up
 
05:47:16.110 --> 05:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
including Alcoholics Anonymous but
 
05:47:18.190 --> 05:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
that's not in the statutes anywhere we
 
05:47:19.830 --> 05:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
can't object to it for that reason in
 
05:47:21.948 --> 05:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
Jael car and I'd like to know what
 
05:47:23.270 --> 05:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
protections there are because that may
 
05:47:24.830 --> 05:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
be fine this time in rules but I don't
 
05:47:26.830 --> 05:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
know what happens next time it's updated
 
05:47:29.110 --> 05:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
and if we were to hurt AA I I wouldn't
 
05:47:31.948 --> 05:47:31.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:34.110 --> 05:47:34.120 align:start position:0%
myself um okay thank you for your
 
05:47:35.590 --> 05:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
question I'm I'm sorry I'm trying to
 
05:47:37.948 --> 05:47:37.958 align:start position:0%
answer on the Fly and so bear with me
 
05:47:41.788 --> 05:47:41.798 align:start position:0%
while I think through this but on um
 
05:47:43.830 --> 05:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
actually um could you just get back to
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
us with that answer I'm have a feeling
 
05:47:46.590 --> 05:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
we're probably not going to exec this
 
05:47:47.830 --> 05:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
one today and I would like to know
 
05:47:49.468 --> 05:47:49.478 align:start position:0%
specifically where in the statutes will
 
05:47:51.788 --> 05:47:51.798 align:start position:0%
protect it because uh we don't want us
 
05:47:54.110 --> 05:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
to get into trouble just guessing we do
 
05:47:56.590 --> 05:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
though I I will absolutely work out a
 
05:47:58.548 --> 05:47:58.558 align:start position:0%
better answer for you but I also just
 
05:48:00.468 --> 05:48:00.478 align:start position:0%
have a one- sentence answer to give you
 
05:48:03.990 --> 05:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
which is page one line 29 begins to say
 
05:48:07.150 --> 05:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
that those um providing early
 
05:48:09.150 --> 05:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
intervention treatment Outpatient
 
05:48:10.750 --> 05:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
Treatment intensive Outpatient Treatment
 
05:48:12.670 --> 05:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
and partial hospitalization residential
 
05:48:14.350 --> 05:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
medically managed intensive treatment
 
05:48:17.548 --> 05:48:17.558 align:start position:0%
which are all um levels of care under
 
05:48:20.350 --> 05:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
Asam criteria and so that I do think we
 
05:48:22.910 --> 05:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
get a little bit more specific into who
 
05:48:26.070 --> 05:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
can be certified and I think we'd be you
 
05:48:27.868 --> 05:48:27.878 align:start position:0%
know happy to work with you to make sure
 
05:48:29.110 --> 05:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
that it's very
 
05:48:31.510 --> 05:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
clear and I'm also going to consider
 
05:48:33.030 --> 05:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
your question and try to get you a more
 
05:48:35.510 --> 05:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
thorough answer thank you thank you
 
05:48:38.868 --> 05:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:40.548 --> 05:48:40.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
05:48:43.910 --> 05:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
chair I want to go back to page three
 
05:48:46.750 --> 05:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
lines 23 through
 
05:48:49.628 --> 05:48:49.638 align:start position:0%
27 and be clear
 
05:48:52.750 --> 05:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
that what you're looking to
 
05:48:55.708 --> 05:48:55.718 align:start position:0%
investigate is not so much the clinical
 
05:48:58.110 --> 05:48:58.120 align:start position:0%
staff but in a facility you could have
 
05:48:59.910 --> 05:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
non-clinical staff and therefore that
 
05:49:02.350 --> 05:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
could be causing an issue for an
 
05:49:04.390 --> 05:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
individual but I want to be clear at
 
05:49:05.590 --> 05:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
least I'm trying to understand it to be
 
05:49:07.910 --> 05:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
clear that that if it's a clinician
 
05:49:09.670 --> 05:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's causing the issue it should be
 
05:49:11.590 --> 05:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
then referred back to the appropriate
 
05:49:13.750 --> 05:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
licensing board for them to take the
 
05:49:15.948 --> 05:49:15.958 align:start position:0%
action against the license C and not get
 
05:49:18.788 --> 05:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
into a situation where this is saying I
 
05:49:21.110 --> 05:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
have an omnius who's investigated
 
05:49:22.548 --> 05:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
certain things and I think the clinician
 
05:49:23.830 --> 05:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
should be taken care of I'm going to
 
05:49:25.628 --> 05:49:25.638 align:start position:0%
take action against the clinician which
 
05:49:27.788 --> 05:49:27.798 align:start position:0%
is totally separate and outside of the
 
05:49:30.070 --> 05:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
domain in my opinion of the licensing
 
05:49:32.708 --> 05:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
board so help me understand how do I
 
05:49:34.868 --> 05:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
unravel all that because in this case
 
05:49:36.830 --> 05:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
you got something that's saying hey
 
05:49:38.150 --> 05:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
authority to go in
 
05:49:41.830 --> 05:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
there and do something under the rules
 
05:49:43.868 --> 05:49:43.878 align:start position:0%
which could impact the clinician but
 
05:49:45.270 --> 05:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
they're also trying to follow the
 
05:49:49.110 --> 05:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
licensing board so how do I unravel that
 
05:49:50.430 --> 05:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
yes I can get back to you with more
 
05:49:52.110 --> 05:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
details on that answer as well but the
 
05:49:54.110 --> 05:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
current the on budsman positions and
 
05:49:57.510 --> 05:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
oplc and lure are all already existing
 
05:49:59.750 --> 05:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
and so that piece I know is already
 
05:50:01.510 --> 05:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
figured out so the detailed answer
 
05:50:03.110 --> 05:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
should you know come from another one of
 
05:50:06.750 --> 05:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
our DHHS staff members um and but this
 
05:50:08.990 --> 05:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
is the certification piece and that this
 
05:50:10.548 --> 05:50:10.558 align:start position:0%
um budsman position in those lines that
 
05:50:12.350 --> 05:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
you're referencing is to add a position
 
05:50:14.110 --> 05:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
into our existing um budsman they would
 
05:50:15.948 --> 05:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
still fall under the way that they
 
05:50:17.510 --> 05:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
currently operate to work with the
 
05:50:18.830 --> 05:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
certification board with when
 
05:50:20.750 --> 05:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate and you'll also hear more
 
05:50:22.190 --> 05:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
from The Advocates of the reason that
 
05:50:23.990 --> 05:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
they brought forward the bill which
 
05:50:27.070 --> 05:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
includes a a specific type of example
 
05:50:29.070 --> 05:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
that you have brought forward which is
 
05:50:31.230 --> 05:50:31.240 align:start position:0%
harm potentially done by someone who is
 
05:50:32.110 --> 05:50:32.120 align:start position:0%
not a
 
05:50:34.830 --> 05:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
clinician follow up follow up and the
 
05:50:37.670 --> 05:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
other question I have goes back to what
 
05:50:39.590 --> 05:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
been brought up a couple of times under
 
05:50:44.310 --> 05:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
page 3 10- 12 no person which I assume
 
05:50:48.350 --> 05:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
if I'm a solo practitioner who wants to
 
05:50:50.948 --> 05:50:50.958 align:start position:0%
provide substance treatment I have to go
 
05:50:52.868 --> 05:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
through the owner's process of getting
 
05:50:54.750 --> 05:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
certification that's following up on
 
05:50:57.150 --> 05:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
what sort of represent Weber is talking
 
05:50:59.510 --> 05:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
about but if I have their credentials
 
05:51:02.030 --> 05:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
and I want to hang a shingle out I have
 
05:51:04.230 --> 05:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
to go to certification I just can't go
 
05:51:06.150 --> 05:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
out and hang out my shingle I have to go
 
05:51:07.750 --> 05:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
back to
 
05:51:10.468 --> 05:51:10.478 align:start position:0%
DHHS get a license and if I do the math
 
05:51:11.910 --> 05:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
correctly it's going to cost between 5
 
05:51:13.910 --> 05:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
and $110,000 because it's number of
 
05:51:15.750 --> 05:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
people to raise
 
05:51:18.548 --> 05:51:18.558 align:start position:0%
$342,000 that's not a small amount of
 
05:51:20.270 --> 05:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
money for somebody's trying to do
 
05:51:22.830 --> 05:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
something for the benefit of society as
 
05:51:25.628 --> 05:51:25.638 align:start position:0%
a so practitioner individual clinicians
 
05:51:28.030 --> 05:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
would be exempt where does it say
 
05:51:31.990 --> 05:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
that not sure can search but it is has
 
05:51:33.868 --> 05:51:33.878 align:start position:0%
been discussed multiple times so thank
 
05:51:33.878 --> 05:51:37.750 align:start position:0%
been discussed multiple times so thank
you

05:51:37.750 --> 05:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:39.190 --> 05:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
what I'm Mr what I'm trying to be
 
05:51:41.070 --> 05:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
fearful of is that you don't have what I
 
05:51:43.310 --> 05:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
call Corporate America
 
05:51:46.868 --> 05:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
becoming the the vehicle because they
 
05:51:50.310 --> 05:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
can afford to have them pay the $5 or
 
05:51:52.468 --> 05:51:52.478 align:start position:0%
$10,000 which is going to then take a
 
05:51:54.150 --> 05:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
lot of individual clinicians that want
 
05:51:56.628 --> 05:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
to do something on that behalf and then
 
05:51:58.190 --> 05:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
forcing them out of the market because
 
05:52:00.070 --> 05:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
they can't afford it
 
05:52:00.080 --> 05:52:03.270 align:start position:0%
they can't afford it
economically

05:52:03.270 --> 05:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:07.430 --> 05:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
yep okay did you find it or no I I have
 
05:52:09.070 --> 05:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
a list of questions that I can get back
 
05:52:10.910 --> 05:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
to the committee with those detailed
 
05:52:12.708 --> 05:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
answers and also there may be somebody
 
05:52:14.310 --> 05:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
behind me that has found it more quickly
 
05:52:16.868 --> 05:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
than me just a challenge to do in real
 
05:52:18.868 --> 05:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
time other questions
 
05:52:22.468 --> 05:52:22.478 align:start position:0%
for person representative Lon um thank
 
05:52:23.910 --> 05:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for one
 
05:52:25.868 --> 05:52:25.878 align:start position:0%
last question um I may have missed this
 
05:52:27.590 --> 05:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
but is there a reason why we're striking
 
05:52:29.270 --> 05:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
everything from the office of alcohol
 
05:52:31.430 --> 05:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
and drug abuse
 
05:52:33.270 --> 05:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
prevention because we're striking all
 
05:52:37.270 --> 05:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
the references to that that I can see
 
05:52:39.468 --> 05:52:39.478 align:start position:0%
I if you don't know that's a valid
 
05:52:41.708 --> 05:52:41.718 align:start position:0%
answer yeah and it doesn't exist that's
 
05:52:43.750 --> 05:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
just not a there there is not an office
 
05:52:46.670 --> 05:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
of alcohol and drug abuse prevention so
 
05:52:48.830 --> 05:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
it may be that we need to replace it but
 
05:52:48.840 --> 05:52:49.628 align:start position:0%
it may be that we need to replace it but
it's

05:52:49.628 --> 05:52:49.638 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:52:51.990 --> 05:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
the removing it because it doesn't exist
 
05:52:54.310 --> 05:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
is a great reason okay so thank
 
05:52:56.628 --> 05:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
05:52:59.110 --> 05:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
questions okay I'm seeing none thank you
 
05:52:59.120 --> 05:53:03.190 align:start position:0%
questions okay I'm seeing none thank you
thank

05:53:03.190 --> 05:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:05.628 --> 05:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Jake
 
05:53:23.670 --> 05:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:27.070 --> 05:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
futes okay I'm stepping in the hot seat
 
05:53:28.628 --> 05:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Jake Barry I'm
 
05:53:30.150 --> 05:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
the vice president of policy at new
 
05:53:32.030 --> 05:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
Futures as many of you know new future
 
05:53:34.110 --> 05:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
is a nonpartisan nonprofit Health policy
 
05:53:36.150 --> 05:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
and advocacy organization we've been
 
05:53:37.990 --> 05:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
working for more than 25 years to help
 
05:53:39.628 --> 05:53:39.638 align:start position:0%
address substance use and addiction in
 
05:53:41.628 --> 05:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
our state uh I don't want to repeat too
 
05:53:42.868 --> 05:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
much of what's been said this afternoon
 
05:53:43.990 --> 05:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
but I do want to stress our strong
 
05:53:46.270 --> 05:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
support for this bill in addition uh
 
05:53:47.430 --> 05:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
though they're unable to be here this
 
05:53:48.788 --> 05:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
afternoon I do because they're off
 
05:53:50.110 --> 05:53:50.120 align:start position:0%
supporting patients I do want to mention
 
05:53:51.708 --> 05:53:51.718 align:start position:0%
the strong support that exists across
 
05:53:53.990 --> 05:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
the Healthcare Community of our state uh
 
05:53:55.628 --> 05:53:55.638 align:start position:0%
in addition to my own written testimony
 
05:53:56.830 --> 05:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
I've shared with you a joint letter of
 
05:53:58.788 --> 05:53:58.798 align:start position:0%
support from more than 30 substance use
 
05:54:00.430 --> 05:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
mental health health care and other
 
05:54:02.548 --> 05:54:02.558 align:start position:0%
provider advocacy and funding
 
05:54:04.910 --> 05:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
organizations in nearly nine months have
 
05:54:06.590 --> 05:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
been working on discussing this Bill
 
05:54:08.750 --> 05:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
I've not heard anyone speak uh speak
 
05:54:10.868 --> 05:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
against it conversely everyone uh from
 
05:54:12.390 --> 05:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
the provider Community the recovery
 
05:54:14.788 --> 05:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
Community elsewhere uh have recognize
 
05:54:16.430 --> 05:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
the need to strengthen oversight and
 
05:54:18.310 --> 05:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
enhance patient protections within our
 
05:54:21.468 --> 05:54:21.478 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment system um a few
 
05:54:23.070 --> 05:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
matters that I want to touch on the
 
05:54:24.948 --> 05:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
questions that were raised to M Mr
 
05:54:28.030 --> 05:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
Higgins uh the the need for this bill
 
05:54:30.590 --> 05:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
came around so for years uh anecdotally
 
05:54:35.430 --> 05:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
we have heard uh uh reports of uh uh
 
05:54:37.510 --> 05:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
group counseling session that don't that
 
05:54:40.510 --> 05:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
aren't abiding by proper uh patient
 
05:54:42.270 --> 05:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
provider ratios we are hearing you know
 
05:54:44.910 --> 05:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
we hear anecdotally about uh providers
 
05:54:47.708 --> 05:54:47.718 align:start position:0%
who are uh uh you know in place who are
 
05:54:50.628 --> 05:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
not um properly certified who are not uh
 
05:54:53.030 --> 05:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh Advanced enough in their own recovery
 
05:54:55.670 --> 05:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh all of the you and most recently we
 
05:54:58.628 --> 05:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
heard um last spring from a podcast that
 
05:54:59.750 --> 05:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure many of you saw from New
 
05:55:01.510 --> 05:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Radio called The 13th
 
05:55:06.468 --> 05:55:06.478 align:start position:0%
Step which detailed uh a a a a system of
 
05:55:08.468 --> 05:55:08.478 align:start position:0%
uh sexual assaults a series of sexual
 
05:55:10.350 --> 05:55:10.360 align:start position:0%
assaults uh within one of our largest
 
05:55:13.548 --> 05:55:13.558 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment systems uh there
 
05:55:15.590 --> 05:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
there's a gap in our oversight here as
 
05:55:17.390 --> 05:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
as has been noted uh individual
 
05:55:19.270 --> 05:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
practitioners are licensed residential
 
05:55:22.030 --> 05:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
facilities are licensed uh but when it
 
05:55:24.030 --> 05:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
comes to outpatient treatment providers
 
05:55:25.468 --> 05:55:25.478 align:start position:0%
uh if there are folks who do not
 
05:55:27.150 --> 05:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
contract with the state they are not
 
05:55:29.030 --> 05:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
registered with the state we don't know
 
05:55:30.830 --> 05:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
where they are many in most cases we
 
05:55:32.990 --> 05:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
don't know where they are we don't know
 
05:55:34.868 --> 05:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
where uh what kind of treatment they're
 
05:55:36.708 --> 05:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
providing we certainly can't sure that
 
05:55:40.070 --> 05:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
they are Opera operating uh uh following
 
05:55:41.230 --> 05:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
uh best practice following
 
05:55:42.750 --> 05:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
evidence-based standards and providing
 
05:55:44.070 --> 05:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
the highest level of care for these
 
05:55:45.868 --> 05:55:45.878 align:start position:0%
people in our community who need it who
 
05:55:48.110 --> 05:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
need it most this not only impacts the
 
05:55:50.430 --> 05:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
recovery of these individuals uh but it
 
05:55:52.270 --> 05:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
weighs down it depletes our entire
 
05:55:53.830 --> 05:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment system this is a
 
05:55:55.830 --> 05:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
system that we have built to be very
 
05:55:58.230 --> 05:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
much interconnected but when folks are
 
05:56:00.310 --> 05:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
being are not receiving the quality of
 
05:56:02.030 --> 05:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
treatment they need uh they are
 
05:56:04.350 --> 05:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
individually harmed but they it impacts
 
05:56:05.788 --> 05:56:05.798 align:start position:0%
their abil their their ability to
 
05:56:07.788 --> 05:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
achieve maintain recovery which means
 
05:56:10.468 --> 05:56:10.478 align:start position:0%
that they they may be at higher risk for
 
05:56:12.310 --> 05:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
relapse and may end up back in the
 
05:56:15.150 --> 05:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
system back in the treatment uh having
 
05:56:18.070 --> 05:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
suffered more harm uh to have to be you
 
05:56:19.708 --> 05:56:19.718 align:start position:0%
know added on to their their original
 
05:56:21.468 --> 05:56:21.478 align:start position:0%
exposure this is a system that we have
 
05:56:23.310 --> 05:56:23.320 align:start position:0%
spent years to build that we have spent
 
05:56:24.708 --> 05:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of dollars to
 
05:56:26.190 --> 05:56:26.200 align:start position:0%
construct and we continue to fund
 
05:56:27.670 --> 05:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
through millions of dollars in state and
 
05:56:30.788 --> 05:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
federal funding uh and yet these gaps in
 
05:56:33.590 --> 05:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
oversight um again weigh it down deplete
 
05:56:36.628 --> 05:56:36.638 align:start position:0%
it they they uh limit the abil ility of
 
05:56:38.590 --> 05:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
our best treatment providers to provide
 
05:56:41.468 --> 05:56:41.478 align:start position:0%
the the services that that needed that
 
05:56:44.390 --> 05:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
we need to uh to to help all of our
 
05:56:45.788 --> 05:56:45.798 align:start position:0%
individuals and to help our state
 
05:56:49.390 --> 05:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
overall as a whole overcome um the the
 
05:56:52.230 --> 05:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
addiction crisis uh so this is intended
 
05:56:56.390 --> 05:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
to fill that Gap uh to ensure that um uh
 
05:56:57.948 --> 05:56:57.958 align:start position:0%
all of our treatment providers that that
 
05:57:00.390 --> 05:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
there is just a more complete map uh of
 
05:57:02.430 --> 05:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
who is providing services in our state
 
05:57:03.948 --> 05:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
uh and and what quality of services
 
05:57:06.390 --> 05:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
they're providing and to ensure uh for
 
05:57:08.830 --> 05:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
the udman piece that there is a
 
05:57:11.350 --> 05:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
mechanism to to really respond to and
 
05:57:14.030 --> 05:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
investigate incidents of of misconduct
 
05:57:16.590 --> 05:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
when they are reported um this would add
 
05:57:17.948 --> 05:57:17.958 align:start position:0%
Again The Specialist position with with
 
05:57:19.590 --> 05:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
the EMB busman's office that would be
 
05:57:21.070 --> 05:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
specially trained and equipped to
 
05:57:23.670 --> 05:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
address to address the very unique uh uh
 
05:57:25.830 --> 05:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
conditions that uh uh in concerns
 
05:57:28.030 --> 05:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
surrounding the vulnerable individuals
 
05:57:30.150 --> 05:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
who are looking to recover from uh from
 
05:57:32.430 --> 05:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder um so I hope that
 
05:57:33.868 --> 05:57:33.878 align:start position:0%
gives a little bit of background uh
 
05:57:35.708 --> 05:57:35.718 align:start position:0%
again we we feel very strongly about
 
05:57:36.788 --> 05:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:57:38.788 --> 05:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
uh all of the recovery centers I know
 
05:57:40.230 --> 05:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
there's talk about the recovery
 
05:57:41.628 --> 05:57:41.638 align:start position:0%
Community all the recovery centers in
 
05:57:43.190 --> 05:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
the state support this uh the New
 
05:57:44.868 --> 05:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire providers Association which
 
05:57:47.548 --> 05:57:47.558 align:start position:0%
repres you bet there's broad support for
 
05:57:49.590 --> 05:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
this bill there's a recognition of the
 
05:57:51.788 --> 05:57:51.798 align:start position:0%
urgent need to to again fill these gaps
 
05:57:53.510 --> 05:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take questions thank
 
05:57:55.788 --> 05:57:55.798 align:start position:0%
you representative of Seth King thank
 
05:57:57.430 --> 05:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
05:57:59.750 --> 05:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
questions um in your own words can you
 
05:58:01.990 --> 05:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
tell me um what the difference is
 
05:58:05.110 --> 05:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
between certification and
 
05:58:07.708 --> 05:58:07.718 align:start position:0%
license honestly in uh my view the
 
05:58:11.070 --> 05:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
biggest difference is that um lure is
 
05:58:14.150 --> 05:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
not currently applied to uh again a
 
05:58:15.670 --> 05:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
segment of service providers in our
 
05:58:17.510 --> 05:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
state of of outpatient service providers
 
05:58:19.590 --> 05:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
they are not subject to lure licensure
 
05:58:22.070 --> 05:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
requirements uh so this uh you know
 
05:58:23.430 --> 05:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately I think these systems would
 
05:58:25.548 --> 05:58:25.558 align:start position:0%
be very similar very parallel um but
 
05:58:27.390 --> 05:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
they uh but the biggest difference is
 
05:58:28.910 --> 05:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
that it only applies to a segment of the
 
05:58:31.310 --> 05:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
service provider organization followup
 
05:58:34.230 --> 05:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
followup because in my mind I see a
 
05:58:37.110 --> 05:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
certification as sort of like a stamp of
 
05:58:41.350 --> 05:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
approval but um you could still exist
 
05:58:43.190 --> 05:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
without that stamp of approval whereas
 
05:58:46.110 --> 05:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
with licenser you can't do it at all
 
05:58:49.070 --> 05:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
unless you've got the license
 
05:58:52.350 --> 05:58:52.360 align:start position:0%
and as was noted earlier uh it says
 
05:58:53.830 --> 05:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
programs and
 
05:58:56.788 --> 05:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
Facilities uh required to be certified
 
05:58:58.868 --> 05:58:58.878 align:start position:0%
shall include for example early
 
05:59:02.708 --> 05:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
intervention treatment so um you're
 
05:59:04.468 --> 05:59:04.478 align:start position:0%
going to be required to get this
 
05:59:07.868 --> 05:59:07.878 align:start position:0%
certification uh and then later on it
 
05:59:07.878 --> 05:59:10.670 align:start position:0%
certification uh and then later on it
says

05:59:10.670 --> 05:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
says
 
05:59:13.830 --> 05:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
um no person may establish dot dot dot
 
05:59:15.590 --> 05:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
without the certification so to me that
 
05:59:18.030 --> 05:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
just seems like lure it's not it's
 
05:59:19.468 --> 05:59:19.478 align:start position:0%
beyond certification at this point if
 
05:59:21.030 --> 05:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
you're not even allowed to do anything
 
05:59:23.270 --> 05:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
without the certification then it's it's
 
05:59:25.510 --> 05:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's a license why why even bother using
 
05:59:27.590 --> 05:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
the word certification because it it
 
05:59:29.270 --> 05:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
sort of I don't know I feel like it it
 
05:59:30.948 --> 05:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
kind of dupes us into being like Oh yeah
 
05:59:32.350 --> 05:59:32.360 align:start position:0%
certification is a good idea and then
 
05:59:33.750 --> 05:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's like no this is a license we're
 
05:59:35.150 --> 05:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
talking about you can't do it without
 
05:59:36.750 --> 05:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
you can't do it you can't even do early
 
05:59:38.548 --> 05:59:38.558 align:start position:0%
intervention without without basically a
 
05:59:40.190 --> 05:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
license now how does that make any sense
 
05:59:41.948 --> 05:59:41.958 align:start position:0%
again early intervention is part of the
 
05:59:43.468 --> 05:59:43.478 align:start position:0%
again the spectrum of services that are
 
05:59:46.230 --> 05:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
part of the the the you know again Asam
 
05:59:48.830 --> 05:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
support Ser Asam defining Services right
 
05:59:50.510 --> 05:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
and and so the I mean this is not
 
05:59:52.750 --> 05:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
intended to mislead in any way uh this
 
05:59:55.270 --> 05:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
is intended to uh you know there there
 
05:59:57.230 --> 05:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
are defin issue definitional issues if
 
05:59:58.830 --> 05:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
we call this lure because there is
 
06:00:00.590 --> 06:00:00.600 align:start position:0%
already an exist an existing lure
 
06:00:02.110 --> 06:00:02.120 align:start position:0%
requirement that applies by the way not
 
06:00:03.868 --> 06:00:03.878 align:start position:0%
only to Residential Treatment programs
 
06:00:05.468 --> 06:00:05.478 align:start position:0%
but to residential Healthcare programs
 
06:00:07.750 --> 06:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
across the across the Spectrum so should
 
06:00:10.310 --> 06:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
we try to call this lure uh that would
 
06:00:12.390 --> 06:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
create all kinds of of confusion and and
 
06:00:14.590 --> 06:00:14.600 align:start position:0%
and uh and lack of clarity this is
 
06:00:16.390 --> 06:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
intended uh you know again I think there
 
06:00:17.788 --> 06:00:17.798 align:start position:0%
will be many parallels between a
 
06:00:20.030 --> 06:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
certification and lure requirements uh
 
06:00:22.910 --> 06:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
this is in intended to ensure that there
 
06:00:25.948 --> 06:00:25.958 align:start position:0%
is a minimum level of care that is being
 
06:00:27.430 --> 06:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
adhered to by all of our service
 
06:00:31.350 --> 06:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
providers uh um and again these are are
 
06:00:33.948 --> 06:00:33.958 align:start position:0%
uh you know substance use treatment is a
 
06:00:35.548 --> 06:00:35.558 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a medicine it's a science
 
06:00:37.190 --> 06:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
there are establish minimum levels of
 
06:00:38.468 --> 06:00:38.478 align:start position:0%
care we just want to make sure that they
 
06:00:40.670 --> 06:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
can be applied to u to all of our
 
06:00:42.350 --> 06:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
treatment providers across the board
 
06:00:44.150 --> 06:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
again with exemptions for small
 
06:00:46.070 --> 06:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
independent uh small independent
 
06:00:47.628 --> 06:00:47.638 align:start position:0%
practitioners because they are already
 
06:00:50.670 --> 06:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
covered by individual lure uh and and
 
06:00:53.350 --> 06:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
other um other areas as needed
 
06:00:54.628 --> 06:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro and then
 
06:00:55.948 --> 06:00:55.958 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant then
 
06:00:58.430 --> 06:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative to thank you Mr chairman
 
06:01:00.110 --> 06:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking this question
 
06:01:05.430 --> 06:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
would I be right to be um reading on
 
06:01:05.440 --> 06:01:06.548 align:start position:0%
would I be right to be um reading on
page

06:01:06.548 --> 06:01:06.558 align:start position:0%
page
 
06:01:09.990 --> 06:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
to line to
 
06:01:13.990 --> 06:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
um that the answer to earlier questions
 
06:01:16.510 --> 06:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
about independent sole
 
06:01:18.310 --> 06:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
practitioners um where it says
 
06:01:18.320 --> 06:01:20.030 align:start position:0%
practitioners um where it says
independent

06:01:20.030 --> 06:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
independent
 
06:01:23.750 --> 06:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
providers etc etc etc shall be exempt
 
06:01:25.948 --> 06:01:25.958 align:start position:0%
from certification correct sir that's
 
06:01:27.390 --> 06:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
that's the intention to establish that
 
06:01:29.310 --> 06:01:29.320 align:start position:0%
again single shingle folks as we call
 
06:01:30.948 --> 06:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
them are are not to be subject to this
 
06:01:32.510 --> 06:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
that is not the intention this is for
 
06:01:34.670 --> 06:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
larger provider organization knowing
 
06:01:36.270 --> 06:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
that again individual practition are
 
06:01:38.350 --> 06:01:38.360 align:start position:0%
also covered by professional lure so
 
06:01:40.948 --> 06:01:40.958 align:start position:0%
that's page two line two correct thank
 
06:01:42.628 --> 06:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
you representative Merchant then
 
06:01:45.390 --> 06:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt thank you Mr chair
 
06:01:47.150 --> 06:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Barry for being here and
 
06:01:50.030 --> 06:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question I totally support the
 
06:01:51.750 --> 06:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill I'm just wrestling
 
06:01:53.110 --> 06:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
with some of the detail with it of
 
06:01:55.670 --> 06:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
course and one of the things I keep
 
06:01:58.708 --> 06:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
hearing is the word service provider and
 
06:02:00.548 --> 06:02:00.558 align:start position:0%
I'll go back to I mentioned before a
 
06:02:02.910 --> 06:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
facility does not provide a service
 
06:02:05.350 --> 06:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
clinicians do sure so therefore the
 
06:02:06.390 --> 06:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
issue is
 
06:02:08.548 --> 06:02:08.558 align:start position:0%
clinicians operating outside of their
 
06:02:11.110 --> 06:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
lure are doing things that are
 
06:02:11.120 --> 06:02:12.910 align:start position:0%
lure are doing things that are
not

06:02:12.910 --> 06:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:02:14.910 --> 06:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate shouldn't the appropriate
 
06:02:16.788 --> 06:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
place to be is go to the licensing board
 
06:02:19.510 --> 06:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
for that clinician versus the facility
 
06:02:21.590 --> 06:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
because the facility Le doesn't have a
 
06:02:23.830 --> 06:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
06:02:25.948 --> 06:02:25.958 align:start position:0%
um you hold the administrator
 
06:02:27.510 --> 06:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
responsible when they weren't the one
 
06:02:29.628 --> 06:02:29.638 align:start position:0%
doing the service thank you for the
 
06:02:31.430 --> 06:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
question how me untangle that because
 
06:02:33.190 --> 06:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm wrestling with so no
 
06:02:33.948 --> 06:02:33.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:02:35.468 --> 06:02:35.478 align:start position:0%
representative know it's very good and
 
06:02:38.190 --> 06:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
apt question question um what we what we
 
06:02:40.468 --> 06:02:40.478 align:start position:0%
have seen in her this is again anecdotal
 
06:02:42.430 --> 06:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
because there is no oversight mechanism
 
06:02:44.230 --> 06:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to track again who these
 
06:02:45.750 --> 06:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
pract you know who these uh
 
06:02:47.670 --> 06:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
organizations are or where they operate
 
06:02:49.830 --> 06:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
so it's very difficult for us to compile
 
06:02:51.468 --> 06:02:51.478 align:start position:0%
compile data on this right we're trying
 
06:02:53.670 --> 06:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
to fill that Gap uh what we hear
 
06:02:56.430 --> 06:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
anecdotally is of certain uh uh provider
 
06:02:58.468 --> 06:02:58.478 align:start position:0%
organizations where this is part of the
 
06:03:00.948 --> 06:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
culture where it's not just a single
 
06:03:02.468 --> 06:03:02.478 align:start position:0%
practitioner who is stepping outside the
 
06:03:03.990 --> 06:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
lines but if that person were to leave
 
06:03:06.030 --> 06:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
and lose their lenser they would be repl
 
06:03:07.468 --> 06:03:07.478 align:start position:0%
by somebody who might do something very
 
06:03:08.868 --> 06:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
similar because this is part of the
 
06:03:11.350 --> 06:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
organiz organizational culture so the
 
06:03:12.868 --> 06:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
intent here is to build up again an
 
06:03:15.750 --> 06:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
oversight mechanism uh uh to be able to
 
06:03:17.708 --> 06:03:17.718 align:start position:0%
guard against that and ensure that it it
 
06:03:18.788 --> 06:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
you know again we already have
 
06:03:20.230 --> 06:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to stop individual
 
06:03:21.750 --> 06:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
practitioners and and help to sort of
 
06:03:23.390 --> 06:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
keep them in line we don't have that for
 
06:03:26.030 --> 06:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
an organization uh in which many of
 
06:03:28.150 --> 06:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
these organizations have multiple sites
 
06:03:29.548 --> 06:03:29.558 align:start position:0%
and have you know many many
 
06:03:31.150 --> 06:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
practitioners and yet again it is built
 
06:03:33.390 --> 06:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
into the the part of the organizational
 
06:03:36.350 --> 06:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
culture follow up follow up
 
06:03:38.230 --> 06:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
so if the intent is to look at the
 
06:03:40.510 --> 06:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
culture within an organization I hear I
 
06:03:44.350 --> 06:03:44.360 align:start position:0%
think you're going if you someone's
 
06:03:46.548 --> 06:03:46.558 align:start position:0%
reporting somewhere I guess it sounds
 
06:03:48.070 --> 06:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
like there's no place for them to report
 
06:03:49.590 --> 06:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
it but if you're getting a licensing
 
06:03:53.110 --> 06:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
board that's getting multiple
 
06:03:55.910 --> 06:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
inquiries from patients and therefore
 
06:03:57.628 --> 06:03:57.638 align:start position:0%
multiple investigations shouldn't that
 
06:03:59.990 --> 06:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
Bo to be taken some sort of action or
 
06:04:02.430 --> 06:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
alerting someone I'm just trying to
 
06:04:04.230 --> 06:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
understand where it's breaking down
 
06:04:06.390 --> 06:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
because you have license clinicians out
 
06:04:09.468 --> 06:04:09.478 align:start position:0%
there that are being held to a standard
 
06:04:11.030 --> 06:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
by the licensing board so I'm just
 
06:04:12.230 --> 06:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
trying to understand where this is
 
06:04:14.310 --> 06:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
breaking down because they're the ones
 
06:04:17.468 --> 06:04:17.478 align:start position:0%
ultimately should be held accountable I
 
06:04:19.590 --> 06:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
I think um you know what we saw and what
 
06:04:21.590 --> 06:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
we learned uh through the 13th Step last
 
06:04:24.310 --> 06:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
year and again that that was dealing not
 
06:04:26.390 --> 06:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
not just with the level of substance use
 
06:04:27.628 --> 06:04:27.638 align:start position:0%
treatment was being provided but that
 
06:04:30.708 --> 06:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
was dealing with again a series of of uh
 
06:04:32.110 --> 06:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and misconduct
 
06:04:34.150 --> 06:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
allegations right that that was coming
 
06:04:36.788 --> 06:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
down from from the top from higher
 
06:04:39.628 --> 06:04:39.638 align:start position:0%
higher level administrators um that sort
 
06:04:41.948 --> 06:04:41.958 align:start position:0%
of set a culture but this was an
 
06:04:44.150 --> 06:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
organization that that was um sort of
 
06:04:46.390 --> 06:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
outside of the the again the oversight
 
06:04:48.190 --> 06:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
and Reporting lines to some to some
 
06:04:49.548 --> 06:04:49.558 align:start position:0%
extent and that there was not the
 
06:04:51.510 --> 06:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
ability to hold number one these nonclin
 
06:04:54.510 --> 06:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
these non-clinicians uh responsible um
 
06:04:56.110 --> 06:04:56.120 align:start position:0%
but again I would I would argue that
 
06:04:58.190 --> 06:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
even at the clinical level again we hear
 
06:05:01.150 --> 06:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
that um you know there are some of these
 
06:05:03.150 --> 06:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
these organizations that are not as
 
06:05:04.548 --> 06:05:04.558 align:start position:0%
committed as we would like to to
 
06:05:06.430 --> 06:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
providing the highest level service and
 
06:05:09.430 --> 06:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
when in individual clinician um you know
 
06:05:10.788 --> 06:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
these these concerns again when you're
 
06:05:12.350 --> 06:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
talking about patient provider ratios
 
06:05:13.948 --> 06:05:13.958 align:start position:0%
and so on it's not just a single
 
06:05:16.628 --> 06:05:16.638 align:start position:0%
clinician this is across the
 
06:05:19.270 --> 06:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
organization thank you representative
 
06:05:21.350 --> 06:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
kofalt thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:05:24.030 --> 06:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so
 
06:05:26.910 --> 06:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
um same question I asked the the the
 
06:05:30.230 --> 06:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
last person um because I've heard you
 
06:05:33.590 --> 06:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
used the I mean you you've advocated for
 
06:05:35.750 --> 06:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
a science-based approach and
 
06:05:35.760 --> 06:05:37.070 align:start position:0%
a science-based approach and
evidence-based

06:05:37.070 --> 06:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
 
06:05:39.310 --> 06:05:39.320 align:start position:0%
approach and yet you're making the case
 
06:05:41.788 --> 06:05:41.798 align:start position:0%
for this bill you've used the word
 
06:05:44.070 --> 06:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
anecdotal or anecdotally at least four
 
06:05:46.190 --> 06:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
times I think five times and you're
 
06:05:50.030 --> 06:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
referencing a podcast I'm which I'm you
 
06:05:52.030 --> 06:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
know I I don't want to belittle events
 
06:05:54.948 --> 06:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
that occurred but I'm I'm struggling
 
06:06:00.590 --> 06:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
with um where is their actual data where
 
06:06:04.110 --> 06:06:04.120 align:start position:0%
is there information to to to indicate
 
06:06:05.628 --> 06:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
that there's an actual problem that we
 
06:06:07.030 --> 06:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
need to solve so there's there's a
 
06:06:08.350 --> 06:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
statement over and over again that we
 
06:06:12.110 --> 06:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
need oversight I'm looking for where is
 
06:06:13.750 --> 06:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
the problem that we're trying to solve
 
06:06:16.310 --> 06:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
so what data do you have to indicate
 
06:06:18.510 --> 06:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
that there is a problem that needs to be
 
06:06:22.190 --> 06:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
solved um first off I mean I'm certain
 
06:06:23.350 --> 06:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
nationally there there's well
 
06:06:25.270 --> 06:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
established data about you know rates of
 
06:06:27.590 --> 06:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
of um again misconduct and and abuse and
 
06:06:29.070 --> 06:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
and sort of vulnerabilities within the
 
06:06:30.750 --> 06:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
substance use system but as far as
 
06:06:32.788 --> 06:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
Statewide you know Miss o Higgins
 
06:06:36.670 --> 06:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
articulated well that um again without
 
06:06:38.990 --> 06:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
any level of oversight we are unable to
 
06:06:41.030 --> 06:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
track we are unable to monitor the you
 
06:06:43.110 --> 06:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
know this this segment of the of the
 
06:06:44.868 --> 06:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
provider population of these outpatient
 
06:06:46.590 --> 06:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
providers specifically if they do not
 
06:06:49.788 --> 06:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
contract with the state then we again we
 
06:06:51.548 --> 06:06:51.558 align:start position:0%
don't have record of where they are of
 
06:06:54.548 --> 06:06:54.558 align:start position:0%
who they're treating or so on um so you
 
06:06:56.310 --> 06:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
know that's part of the intent of this
 
06:06:57.868 --> 06:06:57.878 align:start position:0%
is to fill that Gap to make sure that we
 
06:07:00.350 --> 06:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
are able to uh to to track and gather
 
06:07:03.628 --> 06:07:03.638 align:start position:0%
data and information um so that you know
 
06:07:06.910 --> 06:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
we can build in these protections
 
06:07:09.270 --> 06:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative mlan thank you Mr
 
06:07:10.310 --> 06:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
06:07:12.510 --> 06:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
question so um there's there's a lot of
 
06:07:14.990 --> 06:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
emphasis in in the testimony and the
 
06:07:18.390 --> 06:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
discussion um about uh the Outpatient
 
06:07:21.110 --> 06:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
Treatment providers but when the when
 
06:07:23.230 --> 06:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor brought forth the bill
 
06:07:24.590 --> 06:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
you know she's talking about you know we
 
06:07:27.390 --> 06:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
have a whole bunch of basically Guerilla
 
06:07:29.948 --> 06:07:29.958 align:start position:0%
providers that are kind of kind of
 
06:07:32.030 --> 06:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
operating a little bit under the radar
 
06:07:35.150 --> 06:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
it was my impression that those were
 
06:07:37.990 --> 06:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
most mostly in in the residential
 
06:07:41.910 --> 06:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
treatment category um so maybe that's a
 
06:07:44.868 --> 06:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
a misunderstanding that I have um so
 
06:07:46.110 --> 06:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
could you maybe talk to that a little
 
06:07:48.390 --> 06:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
bit where where are we seeing the bulk
 
06:07:50.110 --> 06:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
of the problem is it you know on the
 
06:07:51.990 --> 06:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
residential treatment side is it on the
 
06:07:54.990 --> 06:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
outpatient side because this does seem
 
06:07:57.110 --> 06:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
kind of broad to me and especially
 
06:07:58.590 --> 06:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
you're getting into a lot of the
 
06:08:01.350 --> 06:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
outpatient stuff so um I just like to
 
06:08:03.868 --> 06:08:03.878 align:start position:0%
maybe go back to where we really seeing
 
06:08:06.350 --> 06:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
the problem and you know because this is
 
06:08:08.830 --> 06:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
very broad thanks sure and first off
 
06:08:10.628 --> 06:08:10.638 align:start position:0%
again I want to reiterate that this bill
 
06:08:12.910 --> 06:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
is uh you know restricted to clinical
 
06:08:14.708 --> 06:08:14.718 align:start position:0%
outpatient services which cover a
 
06:08:16.230 --> 06:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
traditional outpatient intensive
 
06:08:18.150 --> 06:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
outpatient and partial hospitalization
 
06:08:19.510 --> 06:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
those are really the three classes of
 
06:08:20.868 --> 06:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
services that we're trying to capture
 
06:08:22.270 --> 06:08:22.280 align:start position:0%
here because they are not captured
 
06:08:24.628 --> 06:08:24.638 align:start position:0%
elsewhere uh I think Miss o Higgins
 
06:08:28.390 --> 06:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh there are and pardon
 
06:08:30.628 --> 06:08:30.638 align:start position:0%
me I forget the number 63 60 you know
 
06:08:33.150 --> 06:08:33.160 align:start position:0%
more than 60 providers outpatient
 
06:08:34.628 --> 06:08:34.638 align:start position:0%
providers who are register who take
 
06:08:38.190 --> 06:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid in the state of those D DHHS or
 
06:08:39.788 --> 06:08:39.798 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of drug and alcohol Services
 
06:08:42.310 --> 06:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
contracts with nine of them of the rest
 
06:08:44.390 --> 06:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
so that that leaves again this Gap in
 
06:08:46.708 --> 06:08:46.718 align:start position:0%
oversight with the remaining 50 some odd
 
06:08:47.990 --> 06:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
providers there and those are only the
 
06:08:50.070 --> 06:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
ones who who register with Medicaid the
 
06:08:52.670 --> 06:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
ones who did not accept medicate uh the
 
06:08:54.390 --> 06:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
state has no record of them the state
 
06:08:56.190 --> 06:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
has so so again if you want to ask how
 
06:08:57.868 --> 06:08:57.878 align:start position:0%
many of them there are we don't know
 
06:08:59.390 --> 06:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
we're unable to know if you're trying to
 
06:09:00.910 --> 06:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
ask how many people do they treat we
 
06:09:02.430 --> 06:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
don't know we're unable to know and if
 
06:09:03.990 --> 06:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
you're looking to ask about you know
 
06:09:06.190 --> 06:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
instances of of again abuse or
 
06:09:07.948 --> 06:09:07.958 align:start position:0%
misconduct or the level of service they
 
06:09:09.670 --> 06:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
provide we don't know we're not able to
 
06:09:11.190 --> 06:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
know that's what this bill is intending
 
06:09:11.200 --> 06:09:12.430 align:start position:0%
know that's what this bill is intending
to

06:09:12.430 --> 06:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:09:15.708 --> 06:09:15.718 align:start position:0%
address follow up so yeah because I'm
 
06:09:17.868 --> 06:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
just looking in on at the top of page
 
06:09:19.468 --> 06:09:19.478 align:start position:0%
two it does talk about residential
 
06:09:20.910 --> 06:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
treatment and so maybe I was being
 
06:09:22.670 --> 06:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
confused as to where the problem was
 
06:09:25.030 --> 06:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
really lying I I was thinking it was
 
06:09:28.270 --> 06:09:28.280 align:start position:0%
more of a problem with residential proce
 
06:09:30.430 --> 06:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
uh treatment facilities you're saying no
 
06:09:32.430 --> 06:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
the bigger problem is on the outpatient
 
06:09:34.110 --> 06:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
side that's where the lack of oversight
 
06:09:35.670 --> 06:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
exists is where the outpatient decide
 
06:09:37.070 --> 06:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
not having to do with residential yes
 
06:09:39.270 --> 06:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
sir and so residential treatment is
 
06:09:42.270 --> 06:09:42.280 align:start position:0%
already covered they're already licensed
 
06:09:43.750 --> 06:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
they're already licensing standards that
 
06:09:45.270 --> 06:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
exist and yes we're not touching that in
 
06:09:48.670 --> 06:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you representative Leon
 
06:09:50.430 --> 06:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up no any other
 
06:09:53.270 --> 06:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative Nel thank you
 
06:09:55.948 --> 06:09:55.958 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
06:09:59.110 --> 06:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
question go I'm just curious so in in
 
06:10:01.150 --> 06:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
the rehabilitation medicine world we
 
06:10:02.708 --> 06:10:02.718 align:start position:0%
have a thing called carf which is
 
06:10:04.628 --> 06:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
totally voluntary which kind of does
 
06:10:07.430 --> 06:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about um it provides
 
06:10:09.310 --> 06:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
you know you can voluntarily apply for
 
06:10:12.430 --> 06:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
certification of your facility and you
 
06:10:14.230 --> 06:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
know while it's not mandatory there's an
 
06:10:16.788 --> 06:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
incredible Financial incentive to be
 
06:10:19.310 --> 06:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
accredited because insurers will be
 
06:10:21.868 --> 06:10:21.878 align:start position:0%
happy to work with you is there any
 
06:10:23.628 --> 06:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
analogous type thing in the substance
 
06:10:25.510 --> 06:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
abuse world and can you accomplish the
 
06:10:26.788 --> 06:10:26.798 align:start position:0%
same thing you're trying to accomplish
 
06:10:29.948 --> 06:10:29.958 align:start position:0%
here with more of a voluntary program um
 
06:10:31.150 --> 06:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge there's not something
 
06:10:33.070 --> 06:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
analogous within our state anyway it may
 
06:10:36.150 --> 06:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
Exist Elsewhere um I that's certainly
 
06:10:37.430 --> 06:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
something we could look into I would
 
06:10:39.350 --> 06:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
certainly be fearful that the the Bad
 
06:10:40.548 --> 06:10:40.558 align:start position:0%
actors again who are the ones we're
 
06:10:42.110 --> 06:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
really trying to capture here would not
 
06:10:44.150 --> 06:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily be eager to uh to achieve
 
06:10:46.468 --> 06:10:46.478 align:start position:0%
voluntary certification uh and and again
 
06:10:47.590 --> 06:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
those are the ones that we're trying to
 
06:10:49.110 --> 06:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
capture here the ones who either
 
06:10:51.070 --> 06:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
intentionally or unintentionally are not
 
06:10:52.628 --> 06:10:52.638 align:start position:0%
are not following best practice or
 
06:10:54.190 --> 06:10:54.200 align:start position:0%
evidence-based services and therefore
 
06:10:56.230 --> 06:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
are weighing down the entire system
 
06:10:57.310 --> 06:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
representative McKay and then
 
06:10:57.320 --> 06:10:58.670 align:start position:0%
representative McKay and then
representative

06:10:58.670 --> 06:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:11:01.430 --> 06:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr
 
06:11:05.350 --> 06:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
chairman I think several people have
 
06:11:08.590 --> 06:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
echoed what I said and that is what
 
06:11:11.750 --> 06:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
exactly is the problem and I think now
 
06:11:14.750 --> 06:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
you've done a pretty good job of saying
 
06:11:16.830 --> 06:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
from your point of view what the problem
 
06:11:20.190 --> 06:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
is and that is it's not
 
06:11:23.150 --> 06:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
residential it is out
 
06:11:26.868 --> 06:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
outpatient probably independent
 
06:11:28.990 --> 06:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
outpatient uh my
 
06:11:31.430 --> 06:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
concern is
 
06:11:36.110 --> 06:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
um what happened in the past that uh and
 
06:11:39.390 --> 06:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
I I think you made one reference to
 
06:11:42.708 --> 06:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
sexual misbehavior in some
 
06:11:45.230 --> 06:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
agency it's that kind of
 
06:11:49.270 --> 06:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
information that I would would help me
 
06:11:49.280 --> 06:11:50.548 align:start position:0%
information that I would would help me
to

06:11:50.548 --> 06:11:50.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:11:52.350 --> 06:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
understand what
 
06:11:55.270 --> 06:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
happened I've been on a licensing board
 
06:11:59.030 --> 06:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
and I it's very strict so that you're
 
06:12:01.910 --> 06:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
not criticizing licensed board or
 
06:12:01.920 --> 06:12:03.510 align:start position:0%
not criticizing licensed board or
licensed

06:12:03.510 --> 06:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
06:12:06.750 --> 06:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
practitioners and those are not the ones
 
06:12:10.030 --> 06:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
that are creating the problem so the
 
06:12:14.750 --> 06:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
question is how do we get at those
 
06:12:17.310 --> 06:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
individuals uh who are
 
06:12:20.510 --> 06:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
practicing uh and perhaps legally under
 
06:12:23.590 --> 06:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
the present law uh and is that the
 
06:12:25.830 --> 06:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
purpose of this
 
06:12:28.788 --> 06:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
legislation I so so yes certainly as you
 
06:12:30.390 --> 06:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
said we're not we're not here in this
 
06:12:32.150 --> 06:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
legislation trying to address individual
 
06:12:34.510 --> 06:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
license sh we we we re you the licensing
 
06:12:36.190 --> 06:12:36.200 align:start position:0%
boards do what want Wonder F job uh to
 
06:12:38.708 --> 06:12:38.718 align:start position:0%
the extent that they're able to uh to
 
06:12:41.150 --> 06:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
again provide supports and keep people
 
06:12:43.030 --> 06:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
doing what they supposed to be doing
 
06:12:46.830 --> 06:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
what we are concerned about is the
 
06:12:48.390 --> 06:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
places where there may be again an
 
06:12:50.750 --> 06:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
organizational culture uh that that
 
06:12:53.150 --> 06:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's allowing sexual misconduct
 
06:12:56.990 --> 06:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
to exist or or again not following um
 
06:12:58.548 --> 06:12:58.558 align:start position:0%
best practice or evidence-based
 
06:13:01.510 --> 06:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
standards when it comes to treatment
 
06:13:04.708 --> 06:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
um that it expands Beyond in individual
 
06:13:04.718 --> 06:13:05.750 align:start position:0%
um that it expands Beyond in individual
clinician

06:13:05.750 --> 06:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
clinician
 
06:13:07.788 --> 06:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
uh it you know if again if somebody
 
06:13:09.230 --> 06:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
loses their license and they're out the
 
06:13:11.070 --> 06:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
door you'll follow somebody else may
 
06:13:12.590 --> 06:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
come in who is facing additional
 
06:13:14.830 --> 06:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
pressures to again not follow these best
 
06:13:16.990 --> 06:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
standards um so that I mean that's what
 
06:13:19.110 --> 06:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
we are trying to capture here uh again
 
06:13:20.910 --> 06:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
and there are some there is a segment of
 
06:13:22.548 --> 06:13:22.558 align:start position:0%
the outpatient provider popul of the
 
06:13:24.350 --> 06:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
provider population that is not subject
 
06:13:27.030 --> 06:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
to any standards or or lure requirements
 
06:13:29.230 --> 06:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
within the state we are trying to close
 
06:13:31.030 --> 06:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
that Gap make sure that everyone is
 
06:13:34.350 --> 06:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
being um held to to some uh clinical
 
06:13:36.430 --> 06:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
best practice and is being you know uh
 
06:13:37.830 --> 06:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
um being monitored to ensure they're
 
06:13:39.390 --> 06:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
providing the best Services possible to
 
06:13:42.110 --> 06:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
support our entire system follow up
 
06:13:46.230 --> 06:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
follow up can you be more precise as to
 
06:13:49.230 --> 06:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
exactly what it is you're trying to do
 
06:13:51.270 --> 06:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
because you're not talking about
 
06:13:55.590 --> 06:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
changing licensing or or um
 
06:13:58.350 --> 06:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
certifications and I agree
 
06:14:02.628 --> 06:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
certifications I get uh emails almost
 
06:14:05.468 --> 06:14:05.478 align:start position:0%
every week do you want to be CER ified
 
06:14:07.670 --> 06:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
and this that or the other thing sure
 
06:14:10.750 --> 06:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
and those certifications are useless
 
06:14:14.070 --> 06:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
licensing is a very different
 
06:14:17.390 --> 06:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
situation but it still seems as if
 
06:14:19.430 --> 06:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
there's a gap
 
06:14:22.230 --> 06:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
here because there there
 
06:14:22.240 --> 06:14:23.788 align:start position:0%
here because there there
are

06:14:23.788 --> 06:14:23.798 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:14:27.430 --> 06:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
significant uh problems in terms of the
 
06:14:30.070 --> 06:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
number of professional mental health
 
06:14:33.190 --> 06:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
people we have in the state and that's
 
06:14:35.750 --> 06:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
across the board at social workers
 
06:14:38.868 --> 06:14:38.878 align:start position:0%
psychologists nurses psychiatrists sure
 
06:14:40.030 --> 06:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
across the
 
06:14:43.590 --> 06:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
board what is this doing about getting
 
06:14:46.150 --> 06:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
more people licensed because that's
 
06:14:48.910 --> 06:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
where the protection seems to come
 
06:14:51.548 --> 06:14:51.558 align:start position:0%
in so thank you with the question
 
06:14:52.910 --> 06:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative and I should say my
 
06:14:54.510 --> 06:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
organization and many of our partner
 
06:14:55.948 --> 06:14:55.958 align:start position:0%
organizations who have worked on this
 
06:14:57.468 --> 06:14:57.478 align:start position:0%
bill have worked for years to try and
 
06:14:59.788 --> 06:14:59.798 align:start position:0%
support you know expanding the workforce
 
06:15:01.350 --> 06:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
to meet the needs of our state we would
 
06:15:03.708 --> 06:15:03.718 align:start position:0%
certainly not um support something that
 
06:15:05.548 --> 06:15:05.558 align:start position:0%
we saw as interrupting that or or
 
06:15:07.830 --> 06:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
harming uh our Treatment Community in
 
06:15:10.788 --> 06:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
any way um what this is intended to do
 
06:15:13.670 --> 06:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
is ensure that uh the Department of
 
06:15:17.150 --> 06:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services has the tools
 
06:15:20.948 --> 06:15:20.958 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be able to ensure that
 
06:15:22.510 --> 06:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
highlevel evidence-based treatment
 
06:15:24.270 --> 06:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
services are being provided across the
 
06:15:27.150 --> 06:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
board we already have those tools uh
 
06:15:29.070 --> 06:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
mostly in the residential space we have
 
06:15:30.750 --> 06:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
those tools for individual practitioners
 
06:15:33.310 --> 06:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
we do not have those tools for outpa for
 
06:15:35.990 --> 06:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
outpatient providers again there is a
 
06:15:38.670 --> 06:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
lack of oversight a lack of uh ability
 
06:15:41.030 --> 06:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
to know who is who is operating in the
 
06:15:42.750 --> 06:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
state and what level of service they're
 
06:15:44.628 --> 06:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
providing and we know that if there are
 
06:15:46.948 --> 06:15:46.958 align:start position:0%
gaps in in the quality of services
 
06:15:48.670 --> 06:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
provided across our Network that weakens
 
06:15:51.350 --> 06:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
the entire system and we it cost us more
 
06:15:53.670 --> 06:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
money to treat more people increases
 
06:15:56.390 --> 06:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
human suffering uh and and it just is a
 
06:15:59.030 --> 06:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
is a a cost on the entire
 
06:16:01.230 --> 06:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
system one one more
 
06:16:07.670 --> 06:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:11.430 --> 06:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
can you tell me on page
 
06:16:14.868 --> 06:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
two where commissioner shall adopt the
 
06:16:18.030 --> 06:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
rules and where in
 
06:16:22.628 --> 06:16:22.638 align:start position:0%
there is the rule that does the things
 
06:16:24.310 --> 06:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
that you want to
 
06:16:28.030 --> 06:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
happen so the legislation was crafted uh
 
06:16:30.310 --> 06:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
you know very intentionally uh to give
 
06:16:32.548 --> 06:16:32.558 align:start position:0%
the the commissioner and DJJ the
 
06:16:33.990 --> 06:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
authority to craft the rules and the
 
06:16:36.030 --> 06:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
standards as they as you know they need
 
06:16:38.788 --> 06:16:38.798 align:start position:0%
I um they in many ways are the experts
 
06:16:40.270 --> 06:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
they they are they are working with the
 
06:16:43.070 --> 06:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
treatment providers themselves uh to to
 
06:16:45.310 --> 06:16:45.320 align:start position:0%
to do this uh so you know we did not
 
06:16:47.310 --> 06:16:47.320 align:start position:0%
want to dictate what those rules and
 
06:16:48.830 --> 06:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
those standards are we wanted there to
 
06:16:50.350 --> 06:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
be a process of engage you know
 
06:16:51.990 --> 06:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholder engagement to make sure that
 
06:16:54.390 --> 06:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
we are are uh engaging the private Comm
 
06:16:56.468 --> 06:16:56.478 align:start position:0%
the provider Community to establish
 
06:16:58.150 --> 06:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
those rules so what this really does is
 
06:17:00.310 --> 06:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
Kickstart a process that allow you know
 
06:17:01.868 --> 06:17:01.878 align:start position:0%
that kickstarts the development of rules
 
06:17:04.230 --> 06:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
and these standards uh uh so that
 
06:17:05.708 --> 06:17:05.718 align:start position:0%
hopefully when we come back a year from
 
06:17:06.830 --> 06:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
now and try and get some of these
 
06:17:08.270 --> 06:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
positions funded in the budget There are
 
06:17:09.750 --> 06:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
rules in place where they can go out
 
06:17:13.070 --> 06:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
into the field and begin to again um uh
 
06:17:15.190 --> 06:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
fill that Gap map out our our services
 
06:17:17.030 --> 06:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
and ensure that the best practice is
 
06:17:17.040 --> 06:17:17.910 align:start position:0%
and ensure that the best practice is
being

06:17:17.910 --> 06:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
being
 
06:17:20.628 --> 06:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
enforced I'd like to be able to support
 
06:17:22.990 --> 06:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
this I'm
 
06:17:26.190 --> 06:17:26.200 align:start position:0%
struggling representative Weber I I
 
06:17:28.350 --> 06:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
think perhaps I can help Focus the
 
06:17:31.990 --> 06:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
inquiry that my colleague is um who has
 
06:17:33.468 --> 06:17:33.478 align:start position:0%
a great deal
 
06:17:35.910 --> 06:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
more techn techical knowledge about
 
06:17:38.868 --> 06:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
licensing of professions than I do but
 
06:17:41.990 --> 06:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
from all of our different levels of
 
06:17:45.708 --> 06:17:45.718 align:start position:0%
knowledge in this committee what I'm
 
06:17:48.868 --> 06:17:48.878 align:start position:0%
hearing you say and the people who spoke
 
06:17:52.510 --> 06:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
before you say is oh this just applies
 
06:17:54.830 --> 06:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
to outpatient services it doesn't apply
 
06:17:59.230 --> 06:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
to residential treatment and if you read
 
06:18:03.510 --> 06:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
the bill on page 20 on line
 
06:18:08.468 --> 06:18:08.478 align:start position:0%
28 of P the first page it says programs
 
06:18:08.478 --> 06:18:09.430 align:start position:0%
28 of P the first page it says programs
and

06:18:09.430 --> 06:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:18:13.230 --> 06:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
Facilities required to be certified
 
06:18:13.240 --> 06:18:14.350 align:start position:0%
Facilities required to be certified
shall

06:18:14.350 --> 06:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
shall
 
06:18:18.548 --> 06:18:18.558 align:start position:0%
include but not be limited to which is
 
06:18:20.910 --> 06:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
why I think some of the people are
 
06:18:24.868 --> 06:18:24.878 align:start position:0%
anxious about what else it might cover
 
06:18:29.190 --> 06:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
so it says include but not be limited to
 
06:18:32.390 --> 06:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
those providing early intervention
 
06:18:37.310 --> 06:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
treatment outpatient treatment intensive
 
06:18:41.270 --> 06:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
outpatient and partial hospitalization
 
06:18:44.510 --> 06:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
treatment residential treatment which we
 
06:18:47.230 --> 06:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
have been told repeatedly it doesn't
 
06:18:51.070 --> 06:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
cover and medically managed intensive
 
06:18:53.868 --> 06:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
treatment which is a lot of different
 
06:18:56.788 --> 06:18:56.798 align:start position:0%
treatments and which doesn't include
 
06:18:58.510 --> 06:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
everything because it says it
 
06:19:01.110 --> 06:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
specifically it's not just limited to
 
06:19:03.510 --> 06:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
these then there's a period which it
 
06:19:07.830 --> 06:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
took me a while to find and on line two
 
06:19:11.430 --> 06:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
of page two we start in by the people
 
06:19:14.868 --> 06:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
who are exempt from these certifications
 
06:19:19.868 --> 06:19:19.878 align:start position:0%
and that's great but I don't see and
 
06:19:22.030 --> 06:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
maybe they're defined
 
06:19:24.910 --> 06:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
elsewhere we've got five or six
 
06:19:27.868 --> 06:19:27.878 align:start position:0%
different categories of treatment none
 
06:19:31.310 --> 06:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
of which appear to be defined anywhere
 
06:19:34.750 --> 06:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
all of which require to be certified and
 
06:19:36.070 --> 06:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
and I
 
06:19:39.150 --> 06:19:39.160 align:start position:0%
think I'm just speaking for myself but
 
06:19:41.990 --> 06:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
when I listen I hear that other people
 
06:19:44.788 --> 06:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
may be having the same kinds of
 
06:19:49.590 --> 06:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
concerns um how do we know exactly what
 
06:19:51.430 --> 06:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
those things are because it sounds
 
06:19:53.190 --> 06:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
incredibly Broad and I don't have any
 
06:19:53.200 --> 06:19:54.868 align:start position:0%
incredibly Broad and I don't have any
definitions

06:19:54.868 --> 06:19:54.878 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
06:19:57.230 --> 06:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
here first off thank you represent for
 
06:19:59.350 --> 06:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
the question certainly I noted there is
 
06:20:01.230 --> 06:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
a typo residential treatment is listed
 
06:20:03.468 --> 06:20:03.478 align:start position:0%
here when it clearly should not be uh
 
06:20:04.830 --> 06:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
that that's certainly something that can
 
06:20:07.430 --> 06:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
addressed as far as the I think that
 
06:20:08.868 --> 06:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
that remains from an earlier iteration
 
06:20:10.948 --> 06:20:10.958 align:start position:0%
of the bill we will uh we will be sure
 
06:20:12.430 --> 06:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
to address that as far as the
 
06:20:13.990 --> 06:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
definitions I would certainly defer to
 
06:20:15.628 --> 06:20:15.638 align:start position:0%
my friends at DHHS who know better than
 
06:20:17.070 --> 06:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
I do but I'm certain that these that
 
06:20:19.030 --> 06:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
these categories of of of treatment are
 
06:20:20.990 --> 06:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
defined elsewhere in State Statute or
 
06:20:23.548 --> 06:20:23.558 align:start position:0%
administrative rule um and and so they
 
06:20:25.830 --> 06:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
were not specifically defined here
 
06:20:27.548 --> 06:20:27.558 align:start position:0%
because they are I'm certain defined
 
06:20:28.948 --> 06:20:28.958 align:start position:0%
elsewhere but again I would defer to my
 
06:20:30.868 --> 06:20:30.878 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the department and a
 
06:20:33.628 --> 06:20:33.638 align:start position:0%
followup to that but but this is a
 
06:20:37.590 --> 06:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
statute and a statute can't be dependent
 
06:20:39.708 --> 06:20:39.718 align:start position:0%
on a definition found somewhere in an
 
06:20:42.590 --> 06:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
administrative rule uh because
 
06:20:45.548 --> 06:20:45.558 align:start position:0%
administrative rules depend on the
 
06:20:49.230 --> 06:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
statute and and so if it's a statute and
 
06:20:53.270 --> 06:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
there is no definition elsewhere we need
 
06:20:56.750 --> 06:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
to Define it somewhere or we need to
 
06:20:58.670 --> 06:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
specifically state that those
 
06:21:00.270 --> 06:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
definitions are going to be coming
 
06:21:02.628 --> 06:21:02.638 align:start position:0%
through the ru making process and that
 
06:21:05.750 --> 06:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
may have been the intent
 
06:21:08.628 --> 06:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
but I think that there is a lack of
 
06:21:12.468 --> 06:21:12.478 align:start position:0%
clarity in the drafting here
 
06:21:15.628 --> 06:21:15.638 align:start position:0%
that the frustration I'm feeling is I
 
06:21:17.270 --> 06:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
know that people have put a great deal
 
06:21:20.110 --> 06:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
of effort into this sure and it's very
 
06:21:22.230 --> 06:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
clear to me from the emails I'm
 
06:21:25.708 --> 06:21:25.718 align:start position:0%
receiving that people very much want the
 
06:21:28.230 --> 06:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
concept but I'm having a really hard
 
06:21:31.270 --> 06:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
time matching up the words on the page
 
06:21:32.788 --> 06:21:32.798 align:start position:0%
in front of
 
06:21:38.070 --> 06:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
me to the specifics of a
 
06:21:39.948 --> 06:21:39.958 align:start position:0%
concept I hear you representative we
 
06:21:41.868 --> 06:21:41.878 align:start position:0%
would be very glad to uh help to sort of
 
06:21:43.708 --> 06:21:43.718 align:start position:0%
better Define the scope of this in a way
 
06:21:45.070 --> 06:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
that's acceptable to the committee for
 
06:21:47.628 --> 06:21:47.638 align:start position:0%
certain uh uh again there this this is
 
06:21:50.390 --> 06:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
intended to Kickstart a process to again
 
06:21:51.990 --> 06:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
give the department that supported needs
 
06:21:54.390 --> 06:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
to to develop rules around this and
 
06:21:56.430 --> 06:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
criteria and standards and so on but uh
 
06:21:58.670 --> 06:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh sort of better defining
 
06:21:59.750 --> 06:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
the scope of what we're talking about
 
06:22:02.430 --> 06:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
we're happy to
 
06:22:05.948 --> 06:22:05.958 align:start position:0%
do um actually I think maybe I don't
 
06:22:07.830 --> 06:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
need the followup because we're all
 
06:22:09.590 --> 06:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
clear that residential treatment is
 
06:22:11.510 --> 06:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
going to be taken out entirely because
 
06:22:16.070 --> 06:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'm remembering stories about um sober
 
06:22:19.910 --> 06:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
houses in which the only way you could
 
06:22:22.190 --> 06:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
address things that were going on there
 
06:22:23.670 --> 06:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
were through through building codes
 
06:22:25.150 --> 06:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
rather than through something like this
 
06:22:27.310 --> 06:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
which is a more appropriate place so
 
06:22:29.510 --> 06:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's entirely outside of the scope of
 
06:22:31.190 --> 06:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do here residential
 
06:22:34.070 --> 06:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
so so Residential Treatment again is not
 
06:22:36.110 --> 06:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
intended to be included in this bill uh
 
06:22:37.910 --> 06:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
were it included I'm certain that the
 
06:22:39.430 --> 06:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
department would not be here speaking as
 
06:22:41.830 --> 06:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
in as favorably as they have been uh and
 
06:22:43.830 --> 06:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
certainly um sober housing to the extent
 
06:22:44.990 --> 06:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is not covered by
 
06:22:46.830 --> 06:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
this okay so
 
06:22:53.390 --> 06:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
so if I may have one final um followup
 
06:22:56.590 --> 06:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
um would
 
06:22:59.110 --> 06:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
it are you now clear that it would be
 
06:23:01.430 --> 06:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
very helpful to me if there were
 
06:23:03.750 --> 06:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
language in here somewhere either
 
06:23:06.430 --> 06:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
included or reference to where it's
 
06:23:09.310 --> 06:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
included elsewhere in the statute that
 
06:23:11.670 --> 06:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
we are talking about clinical outpatient
 
06:23:13.750 --> 06:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
services which is the overarching
 
06:23:15.830 --> 06:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
language that's been used a couple of
 
06:23:19.750 --> 06:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
times here and which doesn't seem to
 
06:23:22.390 --> 06:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
appear in here anywhere sure and so so
 
06:23:24.670 --> 06:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
that we have a better definition and I'm
 
06:23:27.430 --> 06:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm a good drafter but I'm not
 
06:23:29.350 --> 06:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
Clin I'm
 
06:23:31.830 --> 06:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
not I don't have the professional
 
06:23:34.110 --> 06:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
terminology I understand to be able to
 
06:23:34.120 --> 06:23:34.948 align:start position:0%
terminology I understand to be able to
dra

06:23:34.948 --> 06:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
dra
 
06:23:38.390 --> 06:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
for what it is specifically that you're
 
06:23:41.590 --> 06:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
covering so we would be happy to to to
 
06:23:43.310 --> 06:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
work with you on that for certain to to
 
06:23:44.830 --> 06:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
again better Define the scope of what
 
06:23:46.270 --> 06:23:46.280 align:start position:0%
we're trying to talk about here thank
 
06:23:48.910 --> 06:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
you okay representative kofalt and then
 
06:23:50.670 --> 06:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
representative Leon uh thank you just a
 
06:23:52.590 --> 06:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
point of information so I'm looking at
 
06:23:55.230 --> 06:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
the Gen Court website and
 
06:23:57.628 --> 06:23:57.638 align:start position:0%
um if if
 
06:24:01.030 --> 06:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
residential um if residential treatment
 
06:24:03.190 --> 06:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
is is a typo it's it's a typo that is
 
06:24:05.150 --> 06:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
replicated on the Gen Court website in
 
06:24:07.548 --> 06:24:07.558 align:start position:0%
the as amended by the Senate there's two
 
06:24:09.670 --> 06:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
versions as amended by the Senate so I
 
06:24:12.590 --> 06:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
just I I want to clarify that I I you
 
06:24:14.990 --> 06:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
know my my perception at this point is
 
06:24:17.270 --> 06:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
that that is in the bill as passed by
 
06:24:19.990 --> 06:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate and um that is what we are
 
06:24:21.350 --> 06:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
working with at this point so I just
 
06:24:24.270 --> 06:24:24.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify that
 
06:24:27.350 --> 06:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
06:24:29.070 --> 06:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here to
 
06:24:31.468 --> 06:24:31.478 align:start position:0%
answer all these questions sure um my
 
06:24:33.230 --> 06:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
first is it's you're talking about
 
06:24:35.430 --> 06:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
kickstarting the process for rule making
 
06:24:37.230 --> 06:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
so is the intention with this that
 
06:24:38.750 --> 06:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to figure out what's needed
 
06:24:41.110 --> 06:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
in the ru making process as far as
 
06:24:42.788 --> 06:24:42.798 align:start position:0%
identifying the appropriate standard of
 
06:24:45.110 --> 06:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
care and so and other criteria that that
 
06:24:47.190 --> 06:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
that um facility that organizations
 
06:24:48.788 --> 06:24:48.798 align:start position:0%
would be held to I think that that would
 
06:24:50.708 --> 06:24:50.718 align:start position:0%
be done uh you know be led by the
 
06:24:52.070 --> 06:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
department done through a process of
 
06:24:54.070 --> 06:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholder engagement working with
 
06:24:56.230 --> 06:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
treatment providers to u to establish
 
06:24:59.350 --> 06:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
the the needed criteria uh so is then a
 
06:25:00.750 --> 06:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
followup to that so that would be
 
06:25:03.230 --> 06:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
working ju for us just to handoff the
 
06:25:04.910 --> 06:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
entire process to the department and
 
06:25:07.190 --> 06:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholders because if we don't put any
 
06:25:09.510 --> 06:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
guard guard rails on this we have no
 
06:25:11.788 --> 06:25:11.798 align:start position:0%
input to give in jail car about whether
 
06:25:13.910 --> 06:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
or not these standards are appropriate I
 
06:25:15.590 --> 06:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
think that kickstarting the process at
 
06:25:17.628 --> 06:25:17.638 align:start position:0%
this point would probably be really
 
06:25:19.110 --> 06:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
getting together and working on this as
 
06:25:20.670 --> 06:25:20.680 align:start position:0%
an interim studies so we can get the
 
06:25:21.990 --> 06:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
right language because I'm not
 
06:25:23.910 --> 06:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable just handing it off to a
 
06:25:26.030 --> 06:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
rulemaking where we just said go have
 
06:25:27.750 --> 06:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
fun with it try and figure it out
 
06:25:29.750 --> 06:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
especially because we have language in
 
06:25:31.948 --> 06:25:31.958 align:start position:0%
front of us that says residential
 
06:25:33.750 --> 06:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
treatment and that's what passed the
 
06:25:35.350 --> 06:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
Senate but you're telling me that
 
06:25:36.910 --> 06:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment isn't part of this
 
06:25:38.788 --> 06:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
I mean do you do you understand that
 
06:25:41.150 --> 06:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
this probably isn't ready to move to the
 
06:25:44.030 --> 06:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
next step at this point I I I understand
 
06:25:46.788 --> 06:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
I I would I think we can get it in that
 
06:25:48.468 --> 06:25:48.478 align:start position:0%
shape I think again we that that
 
06:25:50.270 --> 06:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
certainly I I say typo there's an
 
06:25:51.868 --> 06:25:51.878 align:start position:0%
unintentional inclusion of residential
 
06:25:53.310 --> 06:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
and treatment here that's something that
 
06:25:56.110 --> 06:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
we we I think we can I'm hoping very
 
06:25:58.070 --> 06:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
easily amend out of the bill as we can
 
06:26:00.548 --> 06:26:00.558 align:start position:0%
work uh to again better sort of Define
 
06:26:02.670 --> 06:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
the scope of the uh treatment levels
 
06:26:05.310 --> 06:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
that we are uh looking to address here
 
06:26:08.830 --> 06:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
um uh and and I think the you know the
 
06:26:10.430 --> 06:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
department I think feels like this is a
 
06:26:11.990 --> 06:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
level of support that they need in order
 
06:26:15.430 --> 06:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
to Again Begin a process um and and to
 
06:26:17.948 --> 06:26:17.958 align:start position:0%
be able to fill this Gap and uh and
 
06:26:19.670 --> 06:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
again ensure best practice all across
 
06:26:23.468 --> 06:26:23.478 align:start position:0%
our our state um and as more followup um
 
06:26:26.230 --> 06:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
and and it also was brought up about the
 
06:26:28.750 --> 06:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
sexual incidents with some of the sober
 
06:26:30.990 --> 06:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
houses um and that was brought up as
 
06:26:32.708 --> 06:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
something that's relevant to this bill I
 
06:26:34.230 --> 06:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
was that a misunderstanding on my part
 
06:26:36.548 --> 06:26:36.558 align:start position:0%
part because that is residential
 
06:26:38.670 --> 06:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
treatment and if that residential
 
06:26:40.548 --> 06:26:40.558 align:start position:0%
treatment and not having accountability
 
06:26:42.868 --> 06:26:42.878 align:start position:0%
for those Shenanigans is part of the
 
06:26:45.190 --> 06:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
reason for this then it feels like there
 
06:26:47.788 --> 06:26:47.798 align:start position:0%
may just be a complete Mis mismatch um
 
06:26:49.230 --> 06:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
between different people involved about
 
06:26:50.788 --> 06:26:50.798 align:start position:0%
what the actual scope of the bill is I
 
06:26:52.270 --> 06:26:52.280 align:start position:0%
think part of what no certainly like
 
06:26:53.510 --> 06:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
that was in a residential treatment
 
06:26:55.390 --> 06:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
Network I think what it Expos and help
 
06:26:57.270 --> 06:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
push a conversation within the provider
 
06:26:58.868 --> 06:26:58.878 align:start position:0%
community and within the recovery
 
06:27:00.590 --> 06:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
Community is the again the lack of
 
06:27:02.948 --> 06:27:02.958 align:start position:0%
oversight that exists uh in certain
 
06:27:04.548 --> 06:27:04.558 align:start position:0%
parts of the field so certainly that was
 
06:27:06.548 --> 06:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
you know there was misconduct in that
 
06:27:08.110 --> 06:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
corner of the treatment Community but
 
06:27:09.590 --> 06:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
again we've been hearing for years that
 
06:27:11.468 --> 06:27:11.478 align:start position:0%
this exists elsewhere we again we had
 
06:27:13.510 --> 06:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
that there you know lots of anecdotes
 
06:27:15.150 --> 06:27:15.160 align:start position:0%
lots of cases that are known by
 
06:27:17.670 --> 06:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
providers and by individuals of of this
 
06:27:19.990 --> 06:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
kind of misconduct and wrongdoing that
 
06:27:23.430 --> 06:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
um that have existed and uh without um
 
06:27:26.110 --> 06:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
oversight or correction and as a
 
06:27:28.830 --> 06:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
followup as that as licensed Residential
 
06:27:30.990 --> 06:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
Care shouldn't that already be dealt
 
06:27:32.868 --> 06:27:32.878 align:start position:0%
with within the oversight and if that
 
06:27:34.750 --> 06:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
oversight didn't do that how does just a
 
06:27:36.548 --> 06:27:36.558 align:start position:0%
blank check of Ru making in this area
 
06:27:38.788 --> 06:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
fix the other problems I think that you
 
06:27:41.548 --> 06:27:41.558 align:start position:0%
know that um I believe the residential
 
06:27:43.670 --> 06:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
licensing administrative rules are open
 
06:27:45.110 --> 06:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
for comment now that's something that we
 
06:27:46.670 --> 06:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
are certainly working on looking to
 
06:27:48.948 --> 06:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
ensure that these standards that are are
 
06:27:50.868 --> 06:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
requirements that are in place there are
 
06:27:52.310 --> 06:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
are appropriate and tight enough to
 
06:27:54.590 --> 06:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
prevent that kind of thing going forward
 
06:27:56.390 --> 06:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
um what this is intended to address is
 
06:27:58.708 --> 06:27:58.718 align:start position:0%
again the lack of over the lack of
 
06:28:02.030 --> 06:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
oversight that that reporting didn't um
 
06:28:03.910 --> 06:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
didn't just reveal but reinforced it was
 
06:28:05.430 --> 06:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
already already known all throughout the
 
06:28:07.628 --> 06:28:07.638 align:start position:0%
community that that exists again within
 
06:28:09.270 --> 06:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
the specific segment of the Outpatient
 
06:28:11.230 --> 06:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
Treatment Network and that exists
 
06:28:12.750 --> 06:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
despite having licensing of some
 
06:28:15.070 --> 06:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
segments again these U these outpatient
 
06:28:16.750 --> 06:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
treatments are not licensed treatment
 
06:28:18.190 --> 06:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
providers are not licensed they are not
 
06:28:20.070 --> 06:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
certified there's no level of oversight
 
06:28:22.708 --> 06:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
in place for that corner of our map so
 
06:28:24.390 --> 06:28:24.400 align:start position:0%
to speak sorry and I might be a little
 
06:28:26.390 --> 06:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
dense but the people that made headlines
 
06:28:30.310 --> 06:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
are licensed those facilities were LIC
 
06:28:32.070 --> 06:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
and again we are in a parallel way
 
06:28:34.150 --> 06:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the licensing regulations to
 
06:28:36.510 --> 06:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
sure that um they are where they need to
 
06:28:40.430 --> 06:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
be okay thank you representative P off
 
06:28:41.948 --> 06:28:41.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:28:45.030 --> 06:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question in your testimony you
 
06:28:47.230 --> 06:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
were talking about funding provided by
 
06:28:49.948 --> 06:28:49.958 align:start position:0%
the state and uh about all treatment
 
06:28:52.230 --> 06:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
providers and then you talk specifically
 
06:28:55.190 --> 06:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
about best treatment providers so
 
06:28:58.510 --> 06:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
assuming it has something to do with
 
06:29:00.430 --> 06:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
efficiency I don't know if you have
 
06:29:03.030 --> 06:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
number out of your head some percentage
 
06:29:06.868 --> 06:29:06.878 align:start position:0%
point what is the expected recovery uh
 
06:29:12.070 --> 06:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
rate uh what is success rate for overall
 
06:29:15.390 --> 06:29:15.400 align:start position:0%
treatment providers so for the best uh
 
06:29:18.270 --> 06:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
best treatment providers there I I don't
 
06:29:19.350 --> 06:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
have it in front of me there certainly
 
06:29:21.430 --> 06:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
is data available that shows uh you know
 
06:29:23.310 --> 06:29:23.320 align:start position:0%
the impact and sort of I don't know if
 
06:29:24.628 --> 06:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
you want to call them success rates but
 
06:29:26.390 --> 06:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
impact of substances treatment I'm happy
 
06:29:28.110 --> 06:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
to to follow up and provide that for you
 
06:29:35.110 --> 06:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:37.590 --> 06:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
any other
 
06:29:41.350 --> 06:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
questions oh okay thank you all right
 
06:29:44.190 --> 06:29:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:47.430 --> 06:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
all sure I I think I know what the
 
06:29:49.468 --> 06:29:49.478 align:start position:0%
question is but go ahead uh the the
 
06:29:51.750 --> 06:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
question is simply a matter of timing
 
06:29:53.788 --> 06:29:53.798 align:start position:0%
this this is clearly taking more time
 
06:29:58.670 --> 06:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
than we had expected and and we have I I
 
06:30:01.310 --> 06:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
have imposed on several people to become
 
06:30:03.590 --> 06:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
substitutes and things like that and I
 
06:30:06.270 --> 06:30:06.280 align:start position:0%
don't know if we're planning to continue
 
06:30:08.708 --> 06:30:08.718 align:start position:0%
on to an exec session today we're going
 
06:30:11.750 --> 06:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
to continue all of our executive s than
 
06:30:13.468 --> 06:30:13.478 align:start position:0%
until next week that's helpful uh this
 
06:30:16.030 --> 06:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
bill didn't come over to us until Friday
 
06:30:18.230 --> 06:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
yeah if only it had not come over to us
 
06:30:20.510 --> 06:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
at all we'd really be in great shape y
 
06:30:22.948 --> 06:30:22.958 align:start position:0%
but uh it is what it is uh and obviously
 
06:30:25.788 --> 06:30:25.798 align:start position:0%
we want to fin today but we are going to
 
06:30:28.070 --> 06:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
continue all of the items on Executive
 
06:30:30.548 --> 06:30:30.558 align:start position:0%
session until next Wednesday morning and
 
06:30:32.350 --> 06:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
I know representative shabar you have a
 
06:30:34.350 --> 06:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
a deadline to get out of here too so
 
06:30:36.230 --> 06:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
there's several and i' I've informed
 
06:30:37.948 --> 06:30:37.958 align:start position:0%
representative lonza who's been kind
 
06:30:39.388 --> 06:30:39.398 align:start position:0%
enough to sit through all of this that
 
06:30:41.270 --> 06:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
she doesn't need to stay any longer yeah
 
06:30:43.990 --> 06:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
I mean representative Hobson now I oh
 
06:30:46.070 --> 06:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
Christina D did you tell representative
 
06:30:48.230 --> 06:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
Hobson yeah I thought she I saw you
 
06:30:50.948 --> 06:30:50.958 align:start position:0%
talking so I do have an amendment for
 
06:30:52.350 --> 06:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
one of the bills we'll be considering
 
06:30:54.150 --> 06:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
next week I'll pass this out just so
 
06:30:55.830 --> 06:30:55.840 align:start position:0%

when the lights lit it's on you just
 
06:31:31.750 --> 06:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
have to be close enough for it to pick
 
06:31:35.190 --> 06:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
you up as well can you hear me now
 
06:31:39.548 --> 06:31:39.558 align:start position:0%
yes good afternoon
 
06:31:42.430 --> 06:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
um well that was a lot of questions so
 
06:31:44.030 --> 06:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh this is only a second time I've done
 
06:31:46.030 --> 06:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
this so please bear with me um I
 
06:31:48.708 --> 06:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
provided you with my previous testimony
 
06:31:51.708 --> 06:31:51.718 align:start position:0%
to uh the senate committee in
 
06:31:54.110 --> 06:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
January um and I might just go off
 
06:31:56.270 --> 06:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
script because a lot of your questions
 
06:31:58.190 --> 06:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
have led me in a different direction
 
06:32:01.708 --> 06:32:01.718 align:start position:0%
this afternoon um uh my name is Amanda
 
06:32:03.910 --> 06:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
vashan I the coordinator for the mar
 
06:32:06.708 --> 06:32:06.718 align:start position:0%
County Drug Court I work for Riverbend
 
06:32:08.430 --> 06:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center right
 
06:32:10.350 --> 06:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
over on Pleasant Street in
 
06:32:12.948 --> 06:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
conquered um I have worked in the drug
 
06:32:15.670 --> 06:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
court field for over a decade um I
 
06:32:17.510 --> 06:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
worked primarily in straford
 
06:32:21.310 --> 06:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
County um and this bill is particularly
 
06:32:26.030 --> 06:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
relevant to my work um it started in its
 
06:32:28.270 --> 06:32:28.280 align:start position:0%
original form and I think I want to
 
06:32:29.750 --> 06:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
speak to that because I think there
 
06:32:31.628 --> 06:32:31.638 align:start position:0%
might be some confusion regarding the
 
06:32:33.910 --> 06:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
difference of residential versus
 
06:32:37.948 --> 06:32:37.958 align:start position:0%
outpatient so my original remarks are
 
06:32:40.990 --> 06:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
based on the original form of this bill
 
06:32:43.868 --> 06:32:43.878 align:start position:0%
um which was concerned with the
 
06:32:43.878 --> 06:32:45.830 align:start position:0%
um which was concerned with the
residential

06:32:45.830 --> 06:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
residential
 
06:32:45.840 --> 06:32:47.590 align:start position:0%
residential
um

06:32:47.590 --> 06:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:50.628 --> 06:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
concerns it has been um discussed about
 
06:32:54.948 --> 06:32:54.958 align:start position:0%
the podcast um The 13th Step and the
 
06:32:57.830 --> 06:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
sexual um assault allegations that were
 
06:33:01.270 --> 06:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
part of the largest um Treatment Center
 
06:33:05.230 --> 06:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:07.750 --> 06:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
when those allegations were brought
 
06:33:10.788 --> 06:33:10.798 align:start position:0%
forth in that podcast
 
06:33:13.910 --> 06:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
um as a professional in this community
 
06:33:15.388 --> 06:33:15.398 align:start position:0%
for many many
 
06:33:19.868 --> 06:33:19.878 align:start position:0%
years it uh made me lose sleep because
 
06:33:21.628 --> 06:33:21.638 align:start position:0%
as someone who worked in a mandated
 
06:33:23.190 --> 06:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
court system and for those of you who
 
06:33:24.750 --> 06:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
are not familiar with a drug court
 
06:33:27.150 --> 06:33:27.160 align:start position:0%
system it is a nationally recognized
 
06:33:30.270 --> 06:33:30.280 align:start position:0%
system that is a
 
06:33:33.110 --> 06:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
um collaboration between the court
 
06:33:36.150 --> 06:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
system and the treatment Community to
 
06:33:39.110 --> 06:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
address um you know someone who is
 
06:33:41.150 --> 06:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
suffering from substance use who also
 
06:33:44.990 --> 06:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
has um committed a crime felony level
 
06:33:47.430 --> 06:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
crime and it doesn't necessarily mean
 
06:33:50.590 --> 06:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
that their crime was uh you know
 
06:33:53.150 --> 06:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
committed because they are using
 
06:33:55.310 --> 06:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
substances at the time but that their
 
06:33:57.750 --> 06:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
substance use has led them down to a
 
06:34:00.548 --> 06:34:00.558 align:start position:0%
down a path that has resulted in in
 
06:34:04.230 --> 06:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
felony level crime and um
 
06:34:06.830 --> 06:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
to address that the criminal justice
 
06:34:08.750 --> 06:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
system has decided that substance use
 
06:34:10.750 --> 06:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
treatment is the best course of action
 
06:34:12.030 --> 06:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
rather than putting them in prison
 
06:34:14.510 --> 06:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
because Prison does not make someone
 
06:34:17.230 --> 06:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
better um what it does is make them a
 
06:34:20.310 --> 06:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
better Criminal so the drug court
 
06:34:24.190 --> 06:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
system um is a multidisciplinary team
 
06:34:26.110 --> 06:34:26.120 align:start position:0%
and so in marrat County we have the
 
06:34:27.548 --> 06:34:27.558 align:start position:0%
county attorney's office that sits on
 
06:34:28.990 --> 06:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
the team we have the probation and
 
06:34:31.948 --> 06:34:31.958 align:start position:0%
parole department we have um the public
 
06:34:34.030 --> 06:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
defenders office we have conquered
 
06:34:37.310 --> 06:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
Police Department um we have riverb
 
06:34:41.150 --> 06:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
Community Health we have um multiple
 
06:34:42.670 --> 06:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
different agencies that sit around a
 
06:34:44.910 --> 06:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
table the judge judge Kissinger every
 
06:34:46.590 --> 06:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
week we sit around the table and we talk
 
06:34:48.310 --> 06:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
about individuals that are in our
 
06:34:50.750 --> 06:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
program and we look to find a path
 
06:34:53.388 --> 06:34:53.398 align:start position:0%
forward for people who are choosing it's
 
06:34:57.430 --> 06:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
a voluntary program until they plea in
 
06:34:59.270 --> 06:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
they're choosing that path instead of
 
06:35:00.990 --> 06:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
going to prison and I will tell you that
 
06:35:03.990 --> 06:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
that path is harder than going to prison
 
06:35:06.030 --> 06:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
and you may disagree with that but I am
 
06:35:08.708 --> 06:35:08.718 align:start position:0%
a professional in this field for more
 
06:35:10.990 --> 06:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
than a decade and it is easier to sit
 
06:35:13.110 --> 06:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
behind the walls than it is to address
 
06:35:14.868 --> 06:35:14.878 align:start position:0%
the things that have happened to
 
06:35:17.788 --> 06:35:17.798 align:start position:0%
you that got you to this place where
 
06:35:20.310 --> 06:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
you're committing crimes and you would
 
06:35:21.948 --> 06:35:21.958 align:start position:0%
rather do drugs than deal with the
 
06:35:23.948 --> 06:35:23.958 align:start position:0%
trauma that has happened to
 
06:35:27.468 --> 06:35:27.478 align:start position:0%
you this program
 
06:35:29.670 --> 06:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
often because of the fact that you have
 
06:35:33.910 --> 06:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
to deal with your trauma is not e easy
 
06:35:36.548 --> 06:35:36.558 align:start position:0%
and therefore it sometimes
 
06:35:36.558 --> 06:35:38.388 align:start position:0%
and therefore it sometimes
doesn't

06:35:38.388 --> 06:35:38.398 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
06:35:41.150 --> 06:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
um doesn't follow a straight path you
 
06:35:42.910 --> 06:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
can get into the program and you're
 
06:35:45.430 --> 06:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to be coming to RiverBend on
 
06:35:47.230 --> 06:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
Pleasant Street and doing outpatient
 
06:35:50.310 --> 06:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
services and um you know getting
 
06:35:51.868 --> 06:35:51.878 align:start position:0%
frequently drug tested and going to
 
06:35:53.590 --> 06:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
probation and parole but sometimes that
 
06:35:56.190 --> 06:35:56.200 align:start position:0%
level of care is not adequate so our
 
06:36:00.030 --> 06:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
clinical um uh uh clinical therapist
 
06:36:01.868 --> 06:36:01.878 align:start position:0%
will send someone to a higher level of
 
06:36:04.190 --> 06:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
care and sometimes that's in patient
 
06:36:07.628 --> 06:36:07.638 align:start position:0%
but that also might be PHP level of care
 
06:36:09.510 --> 06:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
which is included in this form of the
 
06:36:10.990 --> 06:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
bill that's in front of
 
06:36:14.070 --> 06:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
you when we mandate someone to go to a
 
06:36:17.548 --> 06:36:17.558 align:start position:0%
inpatient Center or PHP level of care we
 
06:36:20.230 --> 06:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
are sending them to a a different agency
 
06:36:22.350 --> 06:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
that we have no control over and the
 
06:36:24.310 --> 06:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
reason I say that that podcast and what
 
06:36:27.150 --> 06:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
it revealed uh you know I lost sleep
 
06:36:29.628 --> 06:36:29.638 align:start position:0%
over it is because I've sent I've been a
 
06:36:31.190 --> 06:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
part of decisions that have sent
 
06:36:34.110 --> 06:36:34.120 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people to those centers and
 
06:36:36.990 --> 06:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
that means that I have sent potentially
 
06:36:38.990 --> 06:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people to situations where
 
06:36:40.750 --> 06:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
they've been
 
06:36:42.670 --> 06:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
revictimized because they've been
 
06:36:45.830 --> 06:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
potentially assaulted in those centers
 
06:36:47.750 --> 06:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
and as it stands right
 
06:36:52.030 --> 06:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
now there is no mechanism in place for
 
06:36:56.110 --> 06:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
people to report those types of assaults
 
06:36:59.868 --> 06:36:59.878 align:start position:0%
you could call the police sure but the
 
06:37:03.070 --> 06:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
reality of that is not an easy thing
 
06:37:04.948 --> 06:37:04.958 align:start position:0%
sexual assaults being reported to the
 
06:37:08.030 --> 06:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
police is not is so under reported
 
06:37:11.030 --> 06:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
because believing someone
 
06:37:14.670 --> 06:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
story you just have to watch the news
 
06:37:17.310 --> 06:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
read a book to know the reality of
 
06:37:22.788 --> 06:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
that if you're in a system where you are
 
06:37:25.750 --> 06:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh somebody with a criminal
 
06:37:27.868 --> 06:37:27.878 align:start position:0%
record you've done a lot of things that
 
06:37:29.830 --> 06:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
you're not proud of and you're at a
 
06:37:31.910 --> 06:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
point where you're in a treatment center
 
06:37:33.030 --> 06:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
the likelihood that you're going to be a
 
06:37:34.750 --> 06:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
believe about something like that is
 
06:37:34.760 --> 06:37:35.708 align:start position:0%
believe about something like that is
really

06:37:35.708 --> 06:37:35.718 align:start position:0%
really
 
06:37:39.510 --> 06:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
low and then if you complicate that by
 
06:37:41.788 --> 06:37:41.798 align:start position:0%
somebody in a position of power over you
 
06:37:44.430 --> 06:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
having done this to you it's even
 
06:37:47.590 --> 06:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
lower so right now as the system
 
06:37:48.868 --> 06:37:48.878 align:start position:0%
currently is
 
06:37:51.110 --> 06:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
designed whether it's outpatient or
 
06:37:53.990 --> 06:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
inpatient there is no mechanism there's
 
06:37:54.000 --> 06:37:55.070 align:start position:0%
inpatient there is no mechanism there's
no

06:37:55.070 --> 06:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:37:58.548 --> 06:37:58.558 align:start position:0%
oversight a path that's easy for someone
 
06:38:02.190 --> 06:38:02.200 align:start position:0%
to confidently report something like
 
06:38:04.590 --> 06:38:04.600 align:start position:0%
that happening to them
 
06:38:07.230 --> 06:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
this bill in its current form or in its
 
06:38:10.190 --> 06:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
previous form allows for the state to
 
06:38:11.230 --> 06:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
have some
 
06:38:14.750 --> 06:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
oversight to provide a mechanism for us
 
06:38:17.788 --> 06:38:17.798 align:start position:0%
to collect the data that um
 
06:38:20.110 --> 06:38:20.120 align:start position:0%
representative Cobalt is asking for for
 
06:38:22.388 --> 06:38:22.398 align:start position:0%
us to be able to track how often is this
 
06:38:24.830 --> 06:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
happening to citizens in New Hampshire
 
06:38:27.548 --> 06:38:27.558 align:start position:0%
probably more than we'd like it to be
 
06:38:30.590 --> 06:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
happening this would provide a mechanism
 
06:38:34.350 --> 06:38:34.360 align:start position:0%
for there to be change made in the state
 
06:38:37.270 --> 06:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
State this would provide some
 
06:38:40.910 --> 06:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
legitimacy to treatment across the state
 
06:38:40.920 --> 06:38:42.430 align:start position:0%
legitimacy to treatment across the state
would

06:38:42.430 --> 06:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:38:45.430 --> 06:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
provide um a level of care a standard of
 
06:38:48.150 --> 06:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
care across the state if you could start
 
06:38:50.948 --> 06:38:50.958 align:start position:0%
wrapping up please um it's important
 
06:38:52.830 --> 06:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
when we think about how vulnerable this
 
06:38:56.110 --> 06:38:56.120 align:start position:0%
population is that as a government that
 
06:38:56.120 --> 06:38:57.150 align:start position:0%
population is that as a government that
we

06:38:57.150 --> 06:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:38:57.160 --> 06:38:59.830 align:start position:0%
we
provide

06:38:59.830 --> 06:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
provide
 
06:39:03.590 --> 06:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
um care that we that we care about the
 
06:39:05.670 --> 06:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
people and that we put some standards in
 
06:39:09.150 --> 06:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
place um to protect them thank you
 
06:39:10.430 --> 06:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
 
06:39:10.440 --> 06:39:12.070 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
representative

06:39:12.070 --> 06:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:39:15.468 --> 06:39:15.478 align:start position:0%
M so it seems to me that
 
06:39:15.478 --> 06:39:20.270 align:start position:0%
M so it seems to me that
the

06:39:20.270 --> 06:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:23.230 --> 06:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
um the number of different terms that
 
06:39:24.708 --> 06:39:24.718 align:start position:0%
people have
 
06:39:28.708 --> 06:39:28.718 align:start position:0%
used is sort of representative of the
 
06:39:30.948 --> 06:39:30.958 align:start position:0%
problem of defining what we're talking
 
06:39:35.110 --> 06:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
about and uh belie me I am persuaded
 
06:39:38.190 --> 06:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
that we need some
 
06:39:41.990 --> 06:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
regulation um and I'm very concerned as
 
06:39:45.310 --> 06:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
you are about the revictimization of
 
06:39:48.430 --> 06:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
people already struggling with
 
06:39:52.910 --> 06:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
trauma past way past current and
 
06:39:57.548 --> 06:39:57.558 align:start position:0%
otherwise you use the phrase PHP level
 
06:40:00.590 --> 06:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
of care which doesn't appear anywhere
 
06:40:02.430 --> 06:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
here and I don't know what the P or the
 
06:40:07.388 --> 06:40:07.398 align:start position:0%
H or the p stands for and so if PHP
 
06:40:09.590 --> 06:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
level of care is something we are
 
06:40:12.510 --> 06:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
talking about could you explain to me
 
06:40:15.990 --> 06:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
what those words are and how those words
 
06:40:18.548 --> 06:40:18.558 align:start position:0%
relate to the words that are actually in
 
06:40:20.030 --> 06:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
the words of the
 
06:40:23.548 --> 06:40:23.558 align:start position:0%
statute uh the bill as amended by the
 
06:40:26.468 --> 06:40:26.478 align:start position:0%
Senate sure um I thought I heard the um
 
06:40:29.830 --> 06:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
DHHS representative say PHP it's partial
 
06:40:34.788 --> 06:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
hospitalization program okay would that
 
06:40:38.150 --> 06:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
be okay I've got I've got a partial
 
06:40:40.310 --> 06:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
hospitalization treatment so that would
 
06:40:42.548 --> 06:40:42.558 align:start position:0%
be the same thing yes okay great thank
 
06:40:44.510 --> 06:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
you very much for that clarification I
 
06:40:47.590 --> 06:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate it representative McKay thank
 
06:40:52.510 --> 06:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman would you believe that I
 
06:40:55.670 --> 06:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh agree with everything you just said
 
06:40:59.230 --> 06:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
uh but what I would like to see is how
 
06:41:02.868 --> 06:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
we can translate that into what the
 
06:41:02.878 --> 06:41:03.830 align:start position:0%
we can translate that into what the
department

06:41:03.830 --> 06:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:41:07.430 --> 06:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
does and maybe we could just send uh
 
06:41:11.628 --> 06:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
Amanda over there and say this is what
 
06:41:15.350 --> 06:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
we mean because you you've encapsulated
 
06:41:16.910 --> 06:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
that very
 
06:41:21.350 --> 06:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
clearly uh as to uh at least from my
 
06:41:24.670 --> 06:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
point of view uh what we should be doing
 
06:41:27.468 --> 06:41:27.478 align:start position:0%
and it's that that has concerned me that
 
06:41:29.510 --> 06:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
I don't see that in the
 
06:41:34.190 --> 06:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
legislation uh so that how we can
 
06:41:37.990 --> 06:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
provide that miracle I don't know but
 
06:41:40.868 --> 06:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm very pleased with what you
 
06:41:42.910 --> 06:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
had to say and I think you said it very
 
06:41:45.990 --> 06:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
clearly so I thank you very much thank
 
06:41:48.708 --> 06:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
you representative Seth K thank you Mr
 
06:41:50.750 --> 06:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for your testimony today
 
06:41:53.510 --> 06:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
really really appreciate it
 
06:41:55.670 --> 06:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
um I
 
06:41:59.468 --> 06:41:59.478 align:start position:0%
see I see there being two types of
 
06:42:03.670 --> 06:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
Institutions um that are labeled here um
 
06:42:07.430 --> 06:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
there are those that get courta
 
06:42:09.830 --> 06:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
appointed patients and then there are
 
06:42:12.430 --> 06:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
those who get patience strictly on a
 
06:42:17.388 --> 06:42:17.398 align:start position:0%
voluntary basis um
 
06:42:19.628 --> 06:42:19.638 align:start position:0%
and I guess one of the problems I had
 
06:42:22.468 --> 06:42:22.478 align:start position:0%
with this is that you know we're it's so
 
06:42:24.910 --> 06:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
broad that it's going to be including
 
06:42:27.388 --> 06:42:27.398 align:start position:0%
you know potentially un
 
06:42:31.628 --> 06:42:31.638 align:start position:0%
unorthodox um uh systems from falling
 
06:42:33.670 --> 06:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
under by they're going to be forced into
 
06:42:36.510 --> 06:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
this one siiz fits-all approach and I I
 
06:42:38.270 --> 06:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
happen to totally agree with you that
 
06:42:40.230 --> 06:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
you know the certification makes sense
 
06:42:42.070 --> 06:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
if the if the government is forcing
 
06:42:44.388 --> 06:42:44.398 align:start position:0%
people to go take care you know take
 
06:42:46.468 --> 06:42:46.478 align:start position:0%
part in these programs then we want
 
06:42:47.868 --> 06:42:47.878 align:start position:0%
certification because we want to make
 
06:42:50.310 --> 06:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
sure that they're their quality long
 
06:42:53.510 --> 06:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
story short um but there are also people
 
06:42:55.948 --> 06:42:55.958 align:start position:0%
who are not mandated by the court system
 
06:42:57.350 --> 06:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
who are going to
 
06:43:00.030 --> 06:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
voluntarily go get into for example
 
06:43:03.670 --> 06:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
early intervention programs um
 
06:43:07.388 --> 06:43:07.398 align:start position:0%
and my concern is that you know um if
 
06:43:09.190 --> 06:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
they're forced into this certification
 
06:43:12.070 --> 06:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
program that um they're going to have to
 
06:43:15.868 --> 06:43:15.878 align:start position:0%
do things by the government book and um
 
06:43:17.190 --> 06:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts on
 
06:43:20.070 --> 06:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
that could I ask you what you mean by
 
06:43:22.468 --> 06:43:22.478 align:start position:0%
unorthodox well I mean uh there's
 
06:43:25.310 --> 06:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
there's faith-based um interventions out
 
06:43:28.350 --> 06:43:28.360 align:start position:0%
there that you know obviously people
 
06:43:30.150 --> 06:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
that believe in a secular society aren't
 
06:43:32.708 --> 06:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
going to be in favor of mandating people
 
06:43:36.030 --> 06:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
go to to or funding um but somebody who
 
06:43:39.548 --> 06:43:39.558 align:start position:0%
is you know voluntarily taking part in
 
06:43:41.548 --> 06:43:41.558 align:start position:0%
these programs they might choose to go
 
06:43:44.868 --> 06:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
to a faith-based program um or or new
 
06:43:47.310 --> 06:43:47.320 align:start position:0%
age or whatever I mean you use your
 
06:43:52.788 --> 06:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
imagin imagination so um you know um I
 
06:43:53.750 --> 06:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
don't know what else to say what are
 
06:43:56.070 --> 06:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on that um I would say
 
06:43:59.468 --> 06:43:59.478 align:start position:0%
that um at in our in our regular medical
 
06:44:01.990 --> 06:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
system that often times so like holistic
 
06:44:05.590 --> 06:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
medicine for example would be um
 
06:44:08.468 --> 06:44:08.478 align:start position:0%
traditional insurance right won't pay
 
06:44:10.388 --> 06:44:10.398 align:start position:0%
for holistic medicine and so people
 
06:44:12.310 --> 06:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
would can choose to do that but they pay
 
06:44:14.548 --> 06:44:14.558 align:start position:0%
out of pocket for that and so I would I
 
06:44:16.788 --> 06:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
would kind of compare those two things
 
06:44:18.310 --> 06:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
right so people can choose to have
 
06:44:20.750 --> 06:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
whatever treatment they want to have
 
06:44:22.590 --> 06:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes that means paying out of
 
06:44:24.910 --> 06:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
pocket but if you're going to go if
 
06:44:28.388 --> 06:44:28.398 align:start position:0%
you're going to get um treatment that an
 
06:44:31.070 --> 06:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
insurer is going to pay for there's a
 
06:44:33.350 --> 06:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
set of standards that is required ired
 
06:44:36.310 --> 06:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
by an insurer to pay for that so if a so
 
06:44:38.430 --> 06:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
if Medicaid or Medicare or a private
 
06:44:39.910 --> 06:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
insurer is going to pay for your
 
06:44:41.590 --> 06:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
treatment there's a set of Standards so
 
06:44:44.708 --> 06:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
if we're asking um Harvard Pilgrim or
 
06:44:47.788 --> 06:44:47.798 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to pay for cancer treatment
 
06:44:49.388 --> 06:44:49.398 align:start position:0%
there's a set of standards for that
 
06:44:51.990 --> 06:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
cancer treatment so I feel like the
 
06:44:54.070 --> 06:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
standards for substance use treatment
 
06:44:56.868 --> 06:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
should be the same across the board if
 
06:44:58.670 --> 06:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
we're asking insurers to pay for that
 
06:45:01.388 --> 06:45:01.398 align:start position:0%
treatment so that's what I would
 
06:45:04.350 --> 06:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
say representative
 
06:45:06.750 --> 06:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:45:08.510 --> 06:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question thank you also
 
06:45:10.670 --> 06:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
for the work that you do with the drug
 
06:45:13.590 --> 06:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
courts it's very difficult work but I
 
06:45:15.788 --> 06:45:15.798 align:start position:0%
think very powerful work as well but I
 
06:45:18.590 --> 06:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk a little bit um about one
 
06:45:20.030 --> 06:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
of the comments you made about you know
 
06:45:22.150 --> 06:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
you're losing sleep because you know
 
06:45:24.388 --> 06:45:24.398 align:start position:0%
you're mandating people they have to go
 
06:45:26.510 --> 06:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
to a residential facility and some
 
06:45:30.270 --> 06:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
terrible things happened there um but we
 
06:45:33.788 --> 06:45:33.798 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony that hey residential
 
06:45:36.150 --> 06:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities that's already
 
06:45:39.830 --> 06:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
covered and in fact explicitly that's
 
06:45:43.230 --> 06:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
going to be taken out of this so um it
 
06:45:45.868 --> 06:45:45.878 align:start position:0%
sounds like that's already covered and
 
06:45:48.990 --> 06:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
yet it's still happened and so I'm just
 
06:45:53.310 --> 06:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
wondering with what within this
 
06:45:55.708 --> 06:45:55.718 align:start position:0%
legislation do you think you know having
 
06:45:58.468 --> 06:45:58.478 align:start position:0%
had a chance to look at it is going to
 
06:46:01.548 --> 06:46:01.558 align:start position:0%
address the concerns um that that you
 
06:46:05.110 --> 06:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
have um or is it just should we be
 
06:46:08.270 --> 06:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
focusing more on just the omus portion
 
06:46:11.070 --> 06:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
to allow for you know better reporting
 
06:46:12.868 --> 06:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
of incidences when they occur because
 
06:46:15.070 --> 06:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
you said it's very hard to when you do
 
06:46:18.670 --> 06:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
have an issue to come forth with that um
 
06:46:20.868 --> 06:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
so so I'm just trying to get some
 
06:46:22.868 --> 06:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
feedback should we be focusing in that
 
06:46:24.830 --> 06:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
area or what is it about the the front
 
06:46:27.430 --> 06:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
lure that it doesn't if residential
 
06:46:29.788 --> 06:46:29.798 align:start position:0%
facilities are already covered it
 
06:46:31.430 --> 06:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like it's working so I
 
06:46:33.388 --> 06:46:33.398 align:start position:0%
would just welcome your thoughts
 
06:46:35.830 --> 06:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
sure I mean I'm going to be completely
 
06:46:38.430 --> 06:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
honest with you I think that um I
 
06:46:40.030 --> 06:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
understand why the bill was modified
 
06:46:42.230 --> 06:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
because I think the dep Department um
 
06:46:44.350 --> 06:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
did identify that there is a lure
 
06:46:46.030 --> 06:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
process in place for residential
 
06:46:47.750 --> 06:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
treatment and so what they've identified
 
06:46:50.948 --> 06:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
is that this process exists they do need
 
06:46:53.548 --> 06:46:53.558 align:start position:0%
to make some changes though because the
 
06:46:56.190 --> 06:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
licensure process exists but the
 
06:46:58.990 --> 06:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
problems also exist so what they're
 
06:47:01.030 --> 06:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
basically saying is that there is a
 
06:47:03.070 --> 06:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
process in place but they're also saying
 
06:47:05.110 --> 06:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
that that process probably needs to be
 
06:47:09.150 --> 06:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
modified to better have to have better
 
06:47:13.030 --> 06:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
oversight to address the issues however
 
06:47:15.830 --> 06:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
there is no process and oversight in
 
06:47:18.910 --> 06:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
existence for the outpatient facilities
 
06:47:22.708 --> 06:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
and providers so this bill separately
 
06:47:25.190 --> 06:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
addresses a lack of oversight in the
 
06:47:28.468 --> 06:47:28.478 align:start position:0%
outpatient world that does not exist
 
06:47:31.070 --> 06:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
whereas the department does have lure
 
06:47:32.788 --> 06:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
and oversight over residential fac
 
06:47:35.468 --> 06:47:35.478 align:start position:0%
facilities already so there does need to
 
06:47:38.590 --> 06:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
be modifications made to an existing
 
06:47:38.600 --> 06:47:39.990 align:start position:0%
be modifications made to an existing
process

06:47:39.990 --> 06:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:47:43.270 --> 06:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
already separately um in other words
 
06:47:45.110 --> 06:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
we're not going to reinvent the wheel
 
06:47:47.070 --> 06:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
that already exists they have identified
 
06:47:48.948 --> 06:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
yes this this is already in existence
 
06:47:51.430 --> 06:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
why not just modify what's already there
 
06:47:53.548 --> 06:47:53.558 align:start position:0%
to address the concerns and then
 
06:47:56.270 --> 06:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
separately there's a need to address a
 
06:47:59.548 --> 06:47:59.558 align:start position:0%
gaping hole here so let's put forth a
 
06:48:02.150 --> 06:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
modified Bill to address the outpatient
 
06:48:02.160 --> 06:48:03.310 align:start position:0%
modified Bill to address the outpatient
issue

06:48:03.310 --> 06:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
issue
 
06:48:04.708 --> 06:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
does that
 
06:48:07.990 --> 06:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
help it does thank you representative
 
06:48:10.190 --> 06:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
Lon and then representative Merchant um
 
06:48:12.350 --> 06:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for T
 
06:48:13.868 --> 06:48:13.878 align:start position:0%
taking the questions and thank you for
 
06:48:15.750 --> 06:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
what you do um I'd actually love to pick
 
06:48:17.030 --> 06:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
your brain on some other things in the
 
06:48:19.590 --> 06:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
future too um I I guess the first is the
 
06:48:21.190 --> 06:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
bill was amended so it doesn't just
 
06:48:22.548 --> 06:48:22.558 align:start position:0%
cover those that are paid for by
 
06:48:24.030 --> 06:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
Insurance it actually expands to
 
06:48:26.750 --> 06:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
everybody so it's changed since then um
 
06:48:29.150 --> 06:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
I guess drilling down on the issue of
 
06:48:30.510 --> 06:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
being concerned that you're sending
 
06:48:32.788 --> 06:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
people to facilities where other people
 
06:48:34.310 --> 06:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
people have been victims of sexual
 
06:48:36.468 --> 06:48:36.478 align:start position:0%
assault looking at the statutes on
 
06:48:39.948 --> 06:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
aggravated fonia sexual assault um it
 
06:48:43.350 --> 06:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
includes um people in a number of areas
 
06:48:45.070 --> 06:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't include any include
 
06:48:47.708 --> 06:48:47.718 align:start position:0%
anybody who um has done this through a
 
06:48:49.430 --> 06:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
position of Authority or power within a
 
06:48:52.590 --> 06:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
substance use um program do you think
 
06:48:54.788 --> 06:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
that enhancing those penalties once
 
06:48:56.750 --> 06:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
somebody is able to come forward and and
 
06:48:59.310 --> 06:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
prove and go through that process where
 
06:49:01.190 --> 06:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
there is a harsher penalty when somebody
 
06:49:03.190 --> 06:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
who's trusted to help take take care of
 
06:49:05.510 --> 06:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
them in a substance use facility is the
 
06:49:07.708 --> 06:49:07.718 align:start position:0%
one who violates them would be one way
 
06:49:10.388 --> 06:49:10.398 align:start position:0%
to help address this as well I don't
 
06:49:12.548 --> 06:49:12.558 align:start position:0%
think it's a bad idea to consider that I
 
06:49:15.350 --> 06:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
think there's a power differential if
 
06:49:17.310 --> 06:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
you are in a position to care for
 
06:49:19.910 --> 06:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
someone and you are victimizing them so
 
06:49:23.590 --> 06:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
similar to if you are um there's a
 
06:49:26.310 --> 06:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
federal statute there's a u prison rate
 
06:49:28.990 --> 06:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
elimination act that um ensures
 
06:49:31.230 --> 06:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
protections for if you are an inmate in
 
06:49:33.270 --> 06:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
a facility and and
 
06:49:36.030 --> 06:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
officer um perpetrate perpetrates a
 
06:49:37.670 --> 06:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
sexual assault against you there's an
 
06:49:40.350 --> 06:49:40.360 align:start position:0%
inherent power differential there that
 
06:49:43.708 --> 06:49:43.718 align:start position:0%
in no way can you can an inmate consent
 
06:49:46.788 --> 06:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
to an officer so I feel like there's a
 
06:49:48.948 --> 06:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
similar differential there's a
 
06:49:50.350 --> 06:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
protection if you're a licensed
 
06:49:53.030 --> 06:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
clinician that you cannot engage in a
 
06:49:54.750 --> 06:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
romantic relationship or sexual
 
06:49:56.310 --> 06:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
relationship so I don't see why that
 
06:49:59.110 --> 06:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
would not be the same if you were in a
 
06:50:01.868 --> 06:50:01.878 align:start position:0%
facility or an Outpatient Center and You
 
06:50:03.708 --> 06:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
Were Somehow
 
06:50:07.030 --> 06:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
um engaging in that um Dynamic no thank
 
06:50:09.110 --> 06:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
you because it does we do cover a prison
 
06:50:10.788 --> 06:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
and we do cover the providers but we
 
06:50:12.230 --> 06:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
don't cover those other people who
 
06:50:14.670 --> 06:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
aren't licensed and it's unfortunate
 
06:50:16.110 --> 06:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
that we had to learn it this way but I
 
06:50:18.388 --> 06:50:18.398 align:start position:0%
think that might be a good correction so
 
06:50:20.750 --> 06:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:50:22.750 --> 06:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also
 
06:50:24.548 --> 06:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question and
 
06:50:28.628 --> 06:50:28.638 align:start position:0%
also uh didto what repres Lon said I
 
06:50:29.590 --> 06:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
want to say thank you for what you're
 
06:50:32.310 --> 06:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
doing it's important I'm trying to also
 
06:50:36.110 --> 06:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
be sure we get this right as much as we
 
06:50:39.030 --> 06:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
can if the insurance companies and
 
06:50:42.990 --> 06:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
people paying a treatment center or
 
06:50:45.110 --> 06:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
paying somebody are they paying the
 
06:50:49.990 --> 06:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:52.590 --> 06:50:52.600 align:start position:0%
clinician I don't know the answer to
 
06:50:54.388 --> 06:50:54.398 align:start position:0%
that I think it probably depends on the
 
06:50:57.708 --> 06:50:57.718 align:start position:0%
structure of where they're receiving
 
06:50:59.868 --> 06:50:59.878 align:start position:0%
treatment I'm trying to try I'm trying
 
06:51:01.948 --> 06:51:01.958 align:start position:0%
to sort of separate this out and saying
 
06:51:06.270 --> 06:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
that if you have a payment methodology
 
06:51:07.990 --> 06:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
coming from an insurance company coming
 
06:51:09.270 --> 06:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health Human
 
06:51:11.868 --> 06:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
Services whatever it's coming from would
 
06:51:13.230 --> 06:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
they not themselves have some
 
06:51:15.388 --> 06:51:15.398 align:start position:0%
requirement for some sort of Standards
 
06:51:17.190 --> 06:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
before they make the payment I mean I
 
06:51:19.468 --> 06:51:19.478 align:start position:0%
can't imagine them going into a contract
 
06:51:21.670 --> 06:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
with an organization or an entity
 
06:51:23.628 --> 06:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
without having some understanding to
 
06:51:28.590 --> 06:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:32.708 --> 06:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
for so the individual uh so the organiz
 
06:51:35.670 --> 06:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
a would have to have licensed clinicians
 
06:51:37.750 --> 06:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
to provide a particular
 
06:51:43.628 --> 06:51:43.638 align:start position:0%
service um so yeah so uh uh for example
 
06:51:46.708 --> 06:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
Riverbend has licensed clinician to
 
06:51:49.030 --> 06:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
provide a particular code of service so
 
06:51:51.310 --> 06:51:51.320 align:start position:0%
if it's individual therapy the clinician
 
06:51:53.030 --> 06:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
has to have a license in order to bill
 
06:51:54.110 --> 06:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
for that
 
06:51:58.270 --> 06:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
service so if I'm Miss hey Mr chair but
 
06:52:00.270 --> 06:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
they're paying Riverbend for the service
 
06:52:02.190 --> 06:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
they're not paying the clinician for the
 
06:52:04.430 --> 06:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
service and what I'm R to be want to be
 
06:52:05.990 --> 06:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
careful we don't create a situation
 
06:52:08.430 --> 06:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
where the provider can ultimately behind
 
06:52:10.150 --> 06:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
behind the
 
06:52:12.468 --> 06:52:12.478 align:start position:0%
facility I give an example something in
 
06:52:14.510 --> 06:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
the world of Pharmacy we have the
 
06:52:16.388 --> 06:52:16.398 align:start position:0%
pharmacy which is owned by corporations
 
06:52:17.830 --> 06:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
and we have the pharmacist providing the
 
06:52:20.590 --> 06:52:20.600 align:start position:0%
service and we used to have the person
 
06:52:22.548 --> 06:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
at the pharmacist would be responsible
 
06:52:24.270 --> 06:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the corporation so the
 
06:52:25.830 --> 06:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
corporation would put the pharmacist out
 
06:52:28.750 --> 06:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
there to Shield themselves and that's my
 
06:52:30.230 --> 06:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
concern is that all of a sudden we have
 
06:52:32.990 --> 06:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
a situation where they say I didn't do
 
06:52:36.110 --> 06:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
anything I don't see the patient that
 
06:52:37.830 --> 06:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
was the person that did it yet the
 
06:52:39.150 --> 06:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
culture that we're talking about could
 
06:52:41.190 --> 06:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
be prevalent within that organization
 
06:52:43.310 --> 06:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
but they have a sacrificial lamb which
 
06:52:44.590 --> 06:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
is the clinician because that's the
 
06:52:46.548 --> 06:52:46.558 align:start position:0%
person we're going to go after so that's
 
06:52:47.910 --> 06:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to weave my way through
 
06:52:49.948 --> 06:52:49.958 align:start position:0%
here and saying I want to be sure that
 
06:52:52.468 --> 06:52:52.478 align:start position:0%
as Mr Barry said if there's a culture
 
06:52:54.350 --> 06:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
within that organization we have a way
 
06:52:56.788 --> 06:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
to identify it and be sure it's not
 
06:52:58.190 --> 06:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
going to happen once we replace that
 
06:53:00.388 --> 06:53:00.398 align:start position:0%
clinician and somebody else comes in and
 
06:53:02.548 --> 06:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
the same power grid you're talking about
 
06:53:05.388 --> 06:53:05.398 align:start position:0%
is still there and we haven't solved the
 
06:53:07.628 --> 06:53:07.638 align:start position:0%
problem I think there's a risk of that
 
06:53:07.638 --> 06:53:09.750 align:start position:0%
problem I think there's a risk of that
for

06:53:09.750 --> 06:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:53:12.910 --> 06:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
sure other
 
06:53:21.310 --> 06:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:23.868 --> 06:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Michael
 
06:53:28.910 --> 06:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:31.350 --> 06:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'm not sure how much time
 
06:53:35.430 --> 06:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:38.110 --> 06:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
yeah please please cut it down well my
 
06:53:38.120 --> 06:53:40.350 align:start position:0%
yeah please please cut it down well my
fa

06:53:40.350 --> 06:53:40.360 align:start position:0%
fa
 
06:53:42.468 --> 06:53:42.478 align:start position:0%
four oh can you push the button your
 
06:53:44.548 --> 06:53:44.558 align:start position:0%
microphone not make the make yeah hit
 
06:53:47.388 --> 06:53:47.398 align:start position:0%
the button on the bottom there you go
 
06:53:48.788 --> 06:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
I'm Mike Bradley I work at the mental
 
06:53:50.230 --> 06:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
health center of Greater Manchester for
 
06:53:53.070 --> 06:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
36 years I'm a master licensed alcohol
 
06:53:55.030 --> 06:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
drug abuse counselor also a licensed
 
06:53:57.190 --> 06:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
clinical mental health counselor I
 
06:53:59.310 --> 06:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
thought I should uh add my voice in
 
06:54:03.030 --> 06:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
favor of this measure uh I think I can
 
06:54:04.948 --> 06:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
contribute to the consideration although
 
06:54:07.510 --> 06:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of points have been covered uh I
 
06:54:10.110 --> 06:54:10.120 align:start position:0%
fully uh appreciate that the devil is in
 
06:54:13.388 --> 06:54:13.398 align:start position:0%
the details on this measure as in many
 
06:54:15.868 --> 06:54:15.878 align:start position:0%
legislative propositions I commend the
 
06:54:18.788 --> 06:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
committee for probing on various details
 
06:54:21.070 --> 06:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
to be considered I recognize that this
 
06:54:23.388 --> 06:54:23.398 align:start position:0%
will be a process of coming up with a
 
06:54:26.548 --> 06:54:26.558 align:start position:0%
product in the end that does what I
 
06:54:29.910 --> 06:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
think if I'm reading the room correctly
 
06:54:31.868 --> 06:54:31.878 align:start position:0%
uh there is a consensus that this kind
 
06:54:35.868 --> 06:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
of over it would be a good thing uh and
 
06:54:38.868 --> 06:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
and I add my voice to that General
 
06:54:41.590 --> 06:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
sensibility uh folks that have ADD asked
 
06:54:44.708 --> 06:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
for statistics for evidence-based as to
 
06:54:47.510 --> 06:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
just how widespread the problem is uh
 
06:54:49.830 --> 06:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely that those are good questions
 
06:54:51.750 --> 06:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding of this measure is it
 
06:54:54.350 --> 06:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
would help us keep track and have the
 
06:54:57.030 --> 06:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
answer to that question I can certainly
 
06:55:00.190 --> 06:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
say anecdotally in my years of practice
 
06:55:03.110 --> 06:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
yes I have come up uh against situations
 
06:55:05.468 --> 06:55:05.478 align:start position:0%
where people have experienced uh
 
06:55:08.270 --> 06:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
substandard care have experienced Frank
 
06:55:11.670 --> 06:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
abuse of a sexual or emotional nature I
 
06:55:14.270 --> 06:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
would po I would point out as I think
 
06:55:15.868 --> 06:55:15.878 align:start position:0%
our previous speaker but I would just
 
06:55:19.070 --> 06:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
emphasize there are powerful forces
 
06:55:21.468 --> 06:55:21.478 align:start position:0%
which make it hard for an individual has
 
06:55:24.350 --> 06:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
experienced that to report it to to
 
06:55:26.868 --> 06:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
pursue it uh the power differential that
 
06:55:30.030 --> 06:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
was alluded to certainly and in general
 
06:55:32.350 --> 06:55:32.360 align:start position:0%
this is a generalization and I own that
 
06:55:35.430 --> 06:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
folks that are in early recovery uh are
 
06:55:37.468 --> 06:55:37.478 align:start position:0%
not particularly strong in areas like
 
06:55:40.430 --> 06:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
self-esteem and self- advocacy uh and so
 
06:55:42.030 --> 06:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
these make it difficult to follow
 
06:55:45.708 --> 06:55:45.718 align:start position:0%
through where um such uh such violations
 
06:55:48.548 --> 06:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
have occurred uh just in terms of
 
06:55:50.628 --> 06:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
details I I I would say there probably
 
06:55:54.910 --> 06:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
is some confusion uh in that a lot of uh
 
06:55:57.430 --> 06:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
places that offer residential are also
 
06:56:00.070 --> 06:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
offering the uh services that are
 
06:56:02.110 --> 06:56:02.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned specifically in this bill IOP
 
06:56:04.628 --> 06:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
which which is intensive outpatient PHP
 
06:56:07.270 --> 06:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
which is partial hospital so so that
 
06:56:10.468 --> 06:56:10.478 align:start position:0%
might be I'll cop out I won't say uh you
 
06:56:12.230 --> 06:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
know how often that happens but that
 
06:56:14.788 --> 06:56:14.798 align:start position:0%
might be another detail that needs to be
 
06:56:17.350 --> 06:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
investigated and uh I I also would point
 
06:56:21.310 --> 06:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
out that yeah where a person's recovery
 
06:56:24.430 --> 06:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
is sabotaged by substantive care or by
 
06:56:28.030 --> 06:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
Frank abuse uh the the effects are are
 
06:56:31.670 --> 06:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
long lasting and pervasive uh and to be
 
06:56:34.430 --> 06:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
crass they're Financial as well uh
 
06:56:37.830 --> 06:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
somebody that pursues recovery and is
 
06:56:40.948 --> 06:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
able to sustain it becomes a productive
 
06:56:43.350 --> 06:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
citizen pays taxes is is a working
 
06:56:45.868 --> 06:56:45.878 align:start position:0%
person uh the person that doesn't
 
06:56:49.110 --> 06:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
succeed in recovery we end up paying we
 
06:56:51.548 --> 06:56:51.558 align:start position:0%
pay for their imprisonment or we pay for
 
06:56:51.558 --> 06:56:52.388 align:start position:0%
pay for their imprisonment or we pay for
their

06:56:52.388 --> 06:56:52.398 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:56:54.190 --> 06:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
hospitalization uh I don't have the
 
06:56:57.150 --> 06:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
stats on how many people are weeks at
 
06:57:01.310 --> 06:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
CMC for endocarditis because they've uh
 
06:57:01.320 --> 06:57:03.110 align:start position:0%
CMC for endocarditis because they've uh
experienced

06:57:03.110 --> 06:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
06:57:06.430 --> 06:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know by injecting unclean
 
06:57:09.430 --> 06:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
syringes uh sure there's a financial
 
06:57:13.270 --> 06:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
aspect to it so uh in general uh I think
 
06:57:15.868 --> 06:57:15.878 align:start position:0%
this uh increased oversight is well
 
06:57:18.350 --> 06:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
worth considering let's see what else I
 
06:57:20.070 --> 06:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
was scribbling notes as I was listening
 
06:57:22.510 --> 06:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
but points have been very well raised
 
06:57:29.230 --> 06:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
but um uh yeah oh I I also um uh yes uh
 
06:57:32.510 --> 06:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
licensed clinicians like myself uh are
 
06:57:34.670 --> 06:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
accountable to the to the appropriate
 
06:57:37.548 --> 06:57:37.558 align:start position:0%
board uh but I think a good percentage
 
06:57:39.548 --> 06:57:39.558 align:start position:0%
again I don't have the stats a good
 
06:57:41.788 --> 06:57:41.798 align:start position:0%
percentage of people that are providing
 
06:57:44.948 --> 06:57:44.958 align:start position:0%
adjunct services or or even qu quazi
 
06:57:48.150 --> 06:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
Clinical Services uh at some of these
 
06:57:51.548 --> 06:57:51.558 align:start position:0%
agencies are are unlicensed uh and so so
 
06:57:53.110 --> 06:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
that would be another uh reason for
 
06:57:55.830 --> 06:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
advocating further further oversight so
 
06:57:57.948 --> 06:57:57.958 align:start position:0%
I I'll do my best if you have questions
 
06:58:00.510 --> 06:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative
 
06:58:02.708 --> 06:58:02.718 align:start position:0%
Weber this is a question question that
 
06:58:05.030 --> 06:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm addressing to you cuz you're in
 
06:58:07.510 --> 06:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
the hot seat there but uh I'm also
 
06:58:10.548 --> 06:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
addressing it to the people behind you
 
06:58:13.948 --> 06:58:13.958 align:start position:0%
do you understand the frustration it is
 
06:58:17.510 --> 06:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
to sit here and you spoke about the
 
06:58:19.788 --> 06:58:19.798 align:start position:0%
devil being in the details and that's
 
06:58:23.110 --> 06:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
what we do yeah this bill do you
 
06:58:25.030 --> 06:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
understand the problem of this bill
 
06:58:28.670 --> 06:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
having arrived to our chairman last week
 
06:58:32.468 --> 06:58:32.478 align:start position:0%
after the Senate it is due out of our
 
06:58:38.350 --> 06:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
committee next week yeah and I sitting
 
06:58:41.708 --> 06:58:41.718 align:start position:0%
here do not have the knowledge or the
 
06:58:45.150 --> 06:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
vocabulary to be able to answer the
 
06:58:48.310 --> 06:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
questions that have been raised here or
 
06:58:50.830 --> 06:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
draft the language and I'm I'm the token
 
06:58:52.868 --> 06:58:52.878 align:start position:0%
attorney on this committee so I'm good
 
06:58:55.708 --> 06:58:55.718 align:start position:0%
at drafting language but I don't have
 
06:58:59.350 --> 06:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
the words to draft the language to get
 
06:58:59.360 --> 06:59:00.270 align:start position:0%
the words to draft the language to get
this

06:59:00.270 --> 06:59:00.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:59:02.590 --> 06:59:02.600 align:start position:0%
bill on its way
 
06:59:06.110 --> 06:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
within a week and do you understand my
 
06:59:09.590 --> 06:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
hope that you and others will work very
 
06:59:12.468 --> 06:59:12.478 align:start position:0%
hard at getting us language that plugs
 
06:59:15.868 --> 06:59:15.878 align:start position:0%
some of the leaks before next week when
 
06:59:18.310 --> 06:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
we have to vote we have to vote on this
 
06:59:21.350 --> 06:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
by next Thursday yeah I I hope my answer
 
06:59:23.590 --> 06:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
is not a cop out I I trust the
 
06:59:25.430 --> 06:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
individuals that are advocating this
 
06:59:29.230 --> 06:59:29.240 align:start position:0%
measure to to work above and beyond what
 
06:59:32.548 --> 06:59:32.558 align:start position:0%
what should be expected uh to to yes to
 
06:59:35.270 --> 06:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh iron out the the the devil that is in
 
06:59:38.190 --> 06:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
the details uh but I do appreciate uh
 
06:59:40.070 --> 06:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
yeah the the uh the urgency the
 
06:59:42.030 --> 06:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
constraint that you're under with regard
 
06:59:44.110 --> 06:59:44.120 align:start position:0%
to time it would be great if you could
 
06:59:45.910 --> 06:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
spend a couple of months considering
 
06:59:48.350 --> 06:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
this you know exactly and and thank you
 
06:59:49.510 --> 06:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
for letting
 
06:59:52.830 --> 06:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
me incorporate my frustration in the
 
06:59:55.548 --> 06:59:55.558 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate it and and thank
 
06:59:57.788 --> 06:59:57.798 align:start position:0%
you all for the work you're doing I yes
 
06:59:59.510 --> 06:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
we do take MasterCard if you wanted to
 
07:00:02.190 --> 07:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
consolid no that's a joke that's a joke
 
07:00:02.200 --> 07:00:02.948 align:start position:0%
consolid no that's a joke that's a joke
I'm

07:00:02.948 --> 07:00:02.958 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
07:00:04.948 --> 07:00:04.958 align:start position:0%
sorry representative
 
07:00:07.990 --> 07:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
Merchant does it come with
 
07:00:13.990 --> 07:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
points what about Visa AB absolutely yes
 
07:00:17.628 --> 07:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
just I I want to just
 
07:00:21.230 --> 07:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
um reinforce what represented Weber said
 
07:00:23.670 --> 07:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
I think the intent we all sort of can
 
07:00:26.868 --> 07:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
concur with but the devil's in a details
 
07:00:30.868 --> 07:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
given the fact that we have 7 days with
 
07:00:32.468 --> 07:00:32.478 align:start position:0%
a lot of work before
 
07:00:34.430 --> 07:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
I'm really more inclined to come down to
 
07:00:36.230 --> 07:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
enim study because I think we need to
 
07:00:37.708 --> 07:00:37.718 align:start position:0%
have the time to really work it through
 
07:00:39.788 --> 07:00:39.798 align:start position:0%
and get it right than to try to push
 
07:00:41.388 --> 07:00:41.398 align:start position:0%
something through I know we folks don't
 
07:00:43.270 --> 07:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
want to hear that but it's better to
 
07:00:45.510 --> 07:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
have something that's done
 
07:00:48.270 --> 07:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
correctly and we can at that point in
 
07:00:49.750 --> 07:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
time move forward with it versus
 
07:00:51.070 --> 07:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
something it passes through because
 
07:00:53.230 --> 07:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
we're on a time crunch and then we try
 
07:00:54.830 --> 07:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to make it work after
 
07:00:57.310 --> 07:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
the fact and clean up the mess so that's
 
07:00:58.868 --> 07:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
where I'm coming down with right now I
 
07:01:00.310 --> 07:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
know this is not an exact session but I
 
07:01:01.948 --> 07:01:01.958 align:start position:0%
just want to share with you thank you
 
07:01:04.190 --> 07:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
for being here and providing it but
 
07:01:06.868 --> 07:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
maybe the powers the be can work
 
07:01:08.510 --> 07:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
diligently over the next seven days to
 
07:01:10.310 --> 07:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
figure out how to make this thing work
 
07:01:12.548 --> 07:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
um but right now without that kind of
 
07:01:15.190 --> 07:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
enormous work put into it I'm leaning
 
07:01:17.310 --> 07:01:17.320 align:start position:0%
more towards U postponing it until the
 
07:01:19.868 --> 07:01:19.878 align:start position:0%
next year yeah no I appreciate what
 
07:01:22.750 --> 07:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
you're saying and um uh that's why I
 
07:01:25.110 --> 07:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
alluded to this as a process I'll leave
 
07:01:27.030 --> 07:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
it to the wisdom of the committee and
 
07:01:29.590 --> 07:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
the legislators to figure out how best
 
07:01:32.310 --> 07:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
to uh articulate and execute that Pro
 
07:01:36.510 --> 07:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
process representative Lon thank you and
 
07:01:39.030 --> 07:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm over this way do you think we
 
07:01:41.030 --> 07:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
might be able to have a miracle and get
 
07:01:43.190 --> 07:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
the language we need because otherwise I
 
07:01:45.388 --> 07:01:45.398 align:start position:0%
also agree that without a miracle from
 
07:01:47.190 --> 07:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
all the people who are the specialists
 
07:01:48.910 --> 07:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
in this and that's sort of asking a
 
07:01:50.868 --> 07:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
question so that I can say something but
 
07:01:52.270 --> 07:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
do you think we'll get the miracle so we
 
07:01:53.670 --> 07:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
can actually have language we pass
 
07:01:55.990 --> 07:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
instead of interim study and a maybe
 
07:01:58.110 --> 07:01:58.120 align:start position:0%
works I I wouldn't be in this profession
 
07:02:00.110 --> 07:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
if I didn't believe in miracles and and
 
07:02:02.948 --> 07:02:02.958 align:start position:0%
I have seen them happen but uh I confess
 
07:02:05.150 --> 07:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
ignorance as to the legislative process
 
07:02:07.070 --> 07:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
and that's why I leave it to the
