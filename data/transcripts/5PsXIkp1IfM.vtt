morning everyone welcome to the house
 
00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 align:start position:0%
committee on Health and Human Services
 
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
and elderly Affairs we have several
 
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
bills noticed for today's hearings and
 
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 align:start position:0%
we'll be getting to those in a moment
 
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
but I'd like you to join me in the
 
00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:52.019 --> 00:03:09.290 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone
 
00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 align:start position:0%
okay the first bill for us to consider
 
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
this morning is the house bill 188 we
 
00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
have the prime sponsor here
 
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative Popovich Mueller

foreign
 
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and members
 
00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
of the committee I appreciate your
 
00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 align:start position:0%
opportunity I'm planning to keep my
 
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
remarks as short as possible because it
 
00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
is a long day for everybody
 
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
on the bright side I don't think we need
 
00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
to spend a lot of time explaining the
 
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill it is attempting to
 
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
remove one paragraph 14 words from the
 
00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
physical therapy bill
 
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is to remove the
 
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
requirement to go see a physician within
 
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
if there is no documented Improvement in
 
00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
25 calendars there at the beginning of
 
00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 align:start position:0%
the treatment
 
00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 align:start position:0%
the reason why I'm advocating for this
 
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
is that we are dealing with a primary
 
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
physician shortage in many parts of the
 
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
state there are people who cannot see
 
00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
their primary physicians you know
 
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
quickly there are people who don't have
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
health insurance and for which the
 
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
burden of having to see a doctor is
 
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
significant in material terms those
 
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
concerns combined with this law can lead
 
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
to people being unable to receive
 
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
Physical Therapy which would you know
 
00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
benefit them
 
00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.689 align:start position:0%
benefit them
now

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
of course the law exists for a reason
 
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
but I want to point out that we have
 
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
about 20 states in the U.S including
 
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Vermont that do not
 
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
have such restrictions in their laws
 
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
that allow direct access and allow the
 
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
patient and the physical therapist to
 
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
decide you know what the proper course
 
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
of action will be
 
00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 align:start position:0%
trust me I'm not gonna come in front of
 
00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
this committee very often and ask us to
 
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
match the Massachusetts level of
 
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
regulations okay
 
00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 align:start position:0%
but this is where we are right now we
 
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
are more tightly regulated than States
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know that honestly have a reputation
 
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
for being over regulated to start with
 
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
now to address potential concerns in
 
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
terms of you know what would happen if
 
00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 align:start position:0%
this restriction would be removed
 
00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 align:start position:0%
the concern in this law was that you
 
00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 align:start position:0%
know Bad actors may take advantage of
 
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
unsuspecting patients and you know offer
 
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
treatment that is not needed
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
I would like to submit to the committee
 
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.170 align:start position:0%
I would like to submit to the committee
that

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
we already have insurance companies that
 
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
have really tight rules around how much
 
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
treatment you can have without a
 
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
doctor's visit physical therapists are
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
highly trained and they absolutely will
 
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
refer the patients who do need to see a
 
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.490 align:start position:0%
refer the patients who do need to see a
doctor

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
to see a doctor if that's the best
 
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
course of treatment
 
00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
and also we have the you know licensing
 
00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 align:start position:0%
board that is perfectly capable of
 
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
handling any you know unacceptable
 
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
ethical violations or practice you know
 
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
or poor practices
 
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.749 align:start position:0%
or poor practices
but

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
the way you see this law it is a law
 
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
that no longer has a purpose
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
and is keeping certain people from
 
00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 align:start position:0%
getting treatments so I would urge the
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
committee to support you know HB 188
 
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
which will remove that uh you know
 
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
regulation so
 
00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
this you know I'll stop here and I'll be
 
00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 align:start position:0%
happy to entertain any questions
 
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing none
 
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
I have no other people signed up to
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
speak on this does anyone else wish to
 
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.490 align:start position:0%
 
.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
.
 
00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman can I ask a question I'm I
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
was assuming somebody else was going to
 
00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:01.909 align:start position:0%
was assuming somebody else was going to
speak

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
um can he can I ask him a question I
 
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
really intended to ask it to somebody
 
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
else representative would you mind
 
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
taking a question from representative
 
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.309 align:start position:0%
taking a question from representative
Nagel

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
I've never turned the question down in
 
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
taking my question I think this question
 
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
is actually more addressed to somebody
 
00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:26.699 align:start position:0%
sitting behind you but um
 
00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:27.890 align:start position:0%
sitting behind you but um
um

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
I've been fortunate to work with
 
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
physical therapists for over 30 years
 
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
and one of the things you develop as a
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
mutual respect for abilities
 
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
um I also work with an international
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
group of people of which I'm happy to um
 
00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:43.259 align:start position:0%
work with a number of Australian
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
physical therapists one of the things
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
that's unique about Australia is they
 
00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
basically have direct access to care and
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
that allows for a lot of creativity
 
00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:55.139 align:start position:0%
um in my mind and I'm just curious and
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
I'm staring with one eyeball is looking
 
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
at somebody else I'm sorry but this is
 
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
an important question
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
my concern is that the way we've done
 
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
things is stifled physical therapy in
 
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
this country and I'm just curious from
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
your point of view does that have any
 
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
role in why you think this is important
 
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
have your professional qualifications
 
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
but I should mention that after an
 
00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
Achilles there and three knee surgeries
 
00:08:19.969 --> 00:08:19.979 align:start position:0%
and the hip surgery I have a lot of
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
frequent flyer miles in uh you know
 
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
being a patient in an office and it has
 
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
been my experience that a lot of the
 
00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
times and I don't mean that in any
 
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
disrespectful way the physical therapist
 
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
is really more qualified and more
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
trained on that specific area of
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
medicine and they know what needs to be
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
done because that's what they do all day
 
00:08:44.329 --> 00:08:44.339 align:start position:0%
I have a huge amount of respect for the
 
00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
medical profession
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
but they have to be way broader and you
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
know don't have the opportunity to delve
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
into those depths as much and honestly
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know my doctors and physical
 
00:08:59.329 --> 00:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
therapists generally agreed but frankly
 
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
personally and speaking just for myself
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
if there was a time on my physical
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
therapist and my doctor disagreed
 
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
personally I would lean more towards you
 
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
know taking the opinion of the physical
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
therapist that I spend way more time
 
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
with and knows my specific injury and
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
how I reacted to it and what happens and
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
you know recovering from one Achilles
 
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
took nine months of physical therapy
 
00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
there was no way I was going to get any
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
documented Improvement in 25 days and of
 
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:29.220 align:start position:0%
course I had a doctor referral because
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know I had a surgeon who sent me to
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
physical therapy but you can also
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
recover from a Achilles there without
 
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
surgery and just by waiting it out
 
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
letting it heal naturally and having
 
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
physical therapy
 
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
you know so I'm sorry for the long
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
answer to that question and of course if
 
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
anybody else was here would like to
 
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
defer in the committee would be willing
 
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
I'd be more than happy to yield
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
um because of all the um reasons that
 
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:09.620 align:start position:0%
you just gave that among which that many
 
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
injuries are pretty intractable and
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
might not see any gains after 25 days
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
did you give any consideration to
 
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
um eliminating this to extending the
 
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
amount of time
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
yes I have
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
um the concern that I have in terms of
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
extending it is that we're just making a
 
00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:35.459 align:start position:0%
law that's in my opinion right now
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
harming patients less harmful but we
 
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
don't fully eliminate the potential harm
 
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
and I think that the experience of the
 
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
States you know 20 states in the U.S not
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
only there are no negative outcomes but
 
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
we save money I mean if if a doctor
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
visit is not necessary we shouldn't
 
00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:55.019 align:start position:0%
mandate it we stop preventing people
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
from accessing care
 
00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
extending the terminal limit the harm
 
00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:00.899 align:start position:0%
but I think the best policy would be to
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
eliminate that
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
other questions this is a follow-up
 
00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:10.700 align:start position:0%
question to represent Mr chairman
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro's question do you
 
00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:15.779 align:start position:0%
um believe that physical therapists have
 
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
the expertise to know when they need
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
help from a doctor
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not a doctor but I will give you a
 
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
personal example
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
before my Achilles there
 
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
I had a Peter in the Achilles and you
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
could feel a bit of a bump in the
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
Achilles and I saw my doctor
 
00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
and he told me you know yeah you have a
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
printer but you are fine playing two
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
more games in the season and then come
 
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
back to me in the summer and see what's
 
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
going on I saw my physical therapist and
 
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
my physical therapist told me I would
 
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
not play soccer under any circumstances
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:11:54.769 --> 00:11:54.779 align:start position:0%
I went and played my two soccer games
 
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
and in the second soccer game about half
 
00:11:59.810 --> 00:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
an hour Arena I tore my achilles so I
 
00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
genuinely believe that and the doctor
 
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
told me there was a risk of tearing it
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
he just said you know the risk wasn't
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
you know huge
 
00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:09.899 align:start position:0%
I believe that because they do this on a
 
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
daily basis and this is the one thing
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
they do in that area they absolutely
 
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
have the ability to recognize and the
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
intent and please understand if they
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
don't do it if they make a mistake they
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
will be sued for you know malpractice if
 
00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:24.839 align:start position:0%
you look at the insurance premiums
 
00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:26.339 align:start position:0%
charge for malpractice to physical
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
therapies they're tiny compared to the
 
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
medical profession and that's because
 
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
they don't generate the complaints and
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
that's because they do refer people to
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
the doctors not as many as
 
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
chairman for taking my question
 
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
um the bill actually says
 
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
no documented Improvement so it doesn't
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
say resolution of symptoms or the
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
Achilles tear personally I know exactly
 
00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
what we went through with an Achilles
 
00:12:59.449 --> 00:12:59.459 align:start position:0%
tendon rupture and that does not get
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
better in 25 days I agree with you there
 
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
but there is oftentimes Improvement so
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
my question is not so much whether or
 
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
not they should be able to continue
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
treatment if they have documented
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
Improvement my concern is that they
 
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
would get maybe two months three months
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
down the road and still no documented
 
00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:21.899 align:start position:0%
Improvement and there's no
 
00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:22.550 align:start position:0%
Improvement and there's no
um

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:26.579 align:start position:0%
no obligation necessarily to refer back
 
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
into the medical you know or into the to
 
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
see a physician about that so my
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
question I guess indirectly is why not
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
extend the period of time
 
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:38.540 align:start position:0%
um or if not you know
 
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is that
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
document and Improvement is different
 
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
than no resolution and how do we resolve
 
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
that because I would like to see
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
something that if somebody's not getting
 
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
better they at least get referred back
 
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
into the system or no improvement thank
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr representative Murphy
 
00:13:58.970 --> 00:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
to make a long story short I absolutely
 
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
understand the distinction
 
00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:04.139 align:start position:0%
but I believe that the patient and the
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
physical therapist and the regulatory
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
bodies and the insurance companies
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
provide enough protections right now for
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
everybody to not get into those
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
situations that you describe where they
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
may get excessive treatment at the end
 
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
of the day a patient knows you know
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
whether what they are doing is good up
 
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
to a point the physical therapist has a
 
00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:28.019 align:start position:0%
huge burden professionally and ethically
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
and in regulation to make to provide
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
those references you know to the doctor
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
if needed and if that doesn't happen
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of mechanisms through
 
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:40.740 align:start position:0%
which a patient can seek recourse for
 
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
any mistakes that were in treatment I
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
just don't feel that
 
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
and I and I'm looking at the experience
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
of all the states that have implemented
 
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
direct taxes because I recognize that
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
the concern is you know I can absolutely
 
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
understand the concern but if you look
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
at the experience of the states that
 
00:14:58.009 --> 00:14:58.019 align:start position:0%
have done this they just don't see that
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
happening in any way that cannot already
 
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
be handled by their existing licensing
 
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.250 align:start position:0%
be handled by their existing licensing
boards

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up just a question you
 
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
mentioned the protections I'm curious
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
what are the protections to protect the
 
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
patient from
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
um not being seen in an appropriate
 
00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
well first again there is a licensing
 
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
board if a patient feels that they
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
should have seen by a doctor but a
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
therapist took advantage of them and
 
00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:25.139 align:start position:0%
treated them forever just to build them
 
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
and without providing Improvement they
 
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
can you know file a complaint with a
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
licensing board most patients do have
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
insurance insurance companies have very
 
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
specific regulations about what
 
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
Improvement do you want to show at most
 
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.430 align:start position:0%
Improvement do you want to show at most
times

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
and frankly again
 
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
I just
 
00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:47.459 align:start position:0%
trust that
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
the combination of the patient's
 
00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:52.019 align:start position:0%

00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
I have not in my personal experience
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
found the follow-up to the doctor to be
 
00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
you know much more than a well of course
 
00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:17.579 align:start position:0%
you need more Physical Therapy type of
 
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
appointment now of course I don't know
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know I respect their professional
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
opinion I'm sure they considered a lot
 
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
of factors they didn't necessarily share
 
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
with me
 
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
but it's really hard for a doctor to
 
00:16:31.009 --> 00:16:31.019 align:start position:0%
deny Physical Therapy anyway so the
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
outcomes tend to always be a automatic
 
00:16:35.689 --> 00:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
referral back to the physical therapist
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
and we seem to create this you know need
 
00:16:39.889 --> 00:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
for all this and the expense and the
 
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
delays without you know providing a
 
00:16:45.889 --> 00:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
benefit that covers the you know burdens
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
provided by it thank you
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions okay thank you

running representative you have three
 
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
minutes please good morning thank you
 
00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee for
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Ellen Reed I
 
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
represent Rockingham 10 new market and
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
new Fields
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
um I will say that I have been in
 
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
physical therapy probably the majority
 
00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
of the last 10 years I've had three
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
surgeries on my knee plus other issues
 
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
you may hear that for those of you
 
00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:26.579 align:start position:0%
who've been in the uh in office for long
 
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
enough that my voice as of the last year
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
has not been the same part of that
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
physical therapy has also been vocal
 
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
therapy so I'm pretty familiar with
 
00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:36.299 align:start position:0%
being bounced back and forth between
 
00:17:39.169 --> 00:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
doctor and physical therapist one of the
 
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
biggest reasons that patients do not see
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
Improvement is compliance we are
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
assigned exercises a lot of us do not do
 
00:17:48.289 --> 00:17:48.299 align:start position:0%
those daily exercises that our physical
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
therapist tells us in that case the
 
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
physical therapist not the doctor is the
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
one to help us figure out ways to find
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
how it works with our schedule how we
 
00:17:59.930 --> 00:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
can remind ourselves to actually comply
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
with those exercises I want to be very
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
clear that there's nothing in in this
 
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
that says a physical therapist can't
 
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
kick a patient back
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
well before 25 days if they think that
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
physical therapy is not the solution
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
regardless if there's Improvement or not
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
there may be a little bit of improvement
 
00:18:18.529 --> 00:18:18.539 align:start position:0%
but they're seeing something that they
 
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
know physical therapy is not going to
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
help with and it needs to go back to a
 
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
doctor and I have my personal so it's
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
kind of the opposite of what we're
 
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
talking about but my personal example
 
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
was one of my knee surgeries I had a
 
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
bolt put in my knee
 
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
um and then I went to the doctor because
 
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
there was a big lump on my knee it was
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
very very hard the doctor said oh that's
 
00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:39.539 align:start position:0%
just a bursa go through Physical Therapy
 
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
you'll be fine the physical therapist
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
looked at it touched it like no that's
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
not a bursa that's a bolt coming out of
 
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
your knee had to go back had to have the
 
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
bolts removed so that was an example
 
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
where the doctor did the doctor did no
 
00:18:54.169 --> 00:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
less than the physical therapist and the
 
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
physical therapist kicked me back to the
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
doctor long before the 25 days even
 
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
though I was showing Improvement the
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
physical therapist knew that my
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
Improvement would be limited because of
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
that bolt coming out of my knee that was
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
interfering with the building of the
 
00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:08.870 align:start position:0%
interfering with the building of the
muscle

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
muscle
 
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
I did just get the okay from the good
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
doctor behind me who many of us know and
 
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
love on this bill before he even saw
 
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
that my name was on it
 
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
um in terms of extending the number of
 
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
days I think any time you kind of put an
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number uh very few of us
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
except for the person behind me very few
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
of us in here are medical doctors so I
 
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
don't think putting an arbitrary number
 
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
even if you're extending it is the
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
solution if you were to amend it and
 
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
again because physical therapists can
 
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
kick people back out well before 25 days
 
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
if they see that it's an issue I think
 
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
if you were to amend it you would simply
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
amend A or B rather to say oh actually
 
00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
it does it's it falls under a it
 
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
literally falls under a so if there's
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
something that like in my case the
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
physical therapist sees that even if you
 
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
are showing Improvement that you're
 
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
going to be limited because there is a
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
medical condition that a doctor needs to
 
00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:07.100 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
then they can and shall according to
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
this take you back to your doctor but I
 
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
think arbitrarily requiring that they
 
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
take you back to your doctor just
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
because uh you're not doing your
 
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
exercises is expensive and time
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
consuming for the patient and that's it
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
perfect timing thank you
 
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
I see no questions thank you okay thank
 
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.630 align:start position:0%
I see no questions thank you okay thank
you

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify Maggie Donahue
 
00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:42.539 align:start position:0%

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:45.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for the record my
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
name is Maggie Donahue I'm a physical
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
therapist and I've been practicing in
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
the state for over 30 years I have
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
served previously on the board of Allied
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
Health Professions including the
 
00:20:59.150 --> 00:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
physical therapy governing board and at
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
this point I am representing the New
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire American Physical Therapy
 
00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
Association members of this state I
 
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to speak because it seemed
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
to be doing okay but I want to just give
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
some very specific answers and
 
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
specifically representative Murphy the
 
00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:15.299 align:start position:0%
reason the number doesn't work is that
 
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
it is totally arbitrary and it
 
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
completely would depend on the type of
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
condition so if I had a client in front
 
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
of me who had a total knee replacement
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't seeing some changes within
 
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:27.419 align:start position:0%
two weeks it would be an unethical move
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
on my part not to be referring them back
 
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
to the physician so on and on the other
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
hand if you have someone who's being
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
treated in a school situation where it's
 
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
a law it's definitely going to be a
 
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
long-term issue 25 days is a drop in the
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
bucket for how long they're going to be
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
having Physical Therapy Services so the
 
00:21:48.169 --> 00:21:48.179 align:start position:0%
the number really does become arbitrary
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
as far as that's concerned that is why
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
we count on good ethical behavior on the
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
part of the physical therapist and why
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
the licensing board would provide that
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
that part of the job so hopefully that
 
00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:02.700 align:start position:0%
would answer your question more
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
specifically I'd be also glad to have
 
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
answer any other questions anybody has
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
yes representative representative Palmer
 
00:22:10.679 --> 00:22:12.289 align:start position:0%
yes representative representative Palmer
sorry

00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:12.299 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you for
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um just to preface
 
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
this um I I've worked in a rehab
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
hospital for years and was a primary
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
care doctor before that working a lot
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
with physical therapists and I've had a
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
bunch of surgeries and I would say one
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
of my concerns about this bill and I am
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
asking you if you have the same concern
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
as it says if if we leave it the way it
 
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
is it says that a
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh the physical therapist shall refer a
 
00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
patient now when I was having problems
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
with my neck
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
um my physical therapist did not refer
 
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
me back he merely said you know this
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
isn't working
 
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
um and he talked to my primary care
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
doctor who referred me to a neurosurgeon
 
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
but the physical therapist did not
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
actually make a referral he just told
 
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
the doctor my doctor was going on that
 
00:23:06.169 --> 00:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
might not fit this law that this the way
 
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
this law works because it wasn't
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
technically a referral by the physical
 
00:23:12.289 --> 00:23:12.299 align:start position:0%
therapist it was simply a call and that
 
00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
would be one of my concerns here is that
 
00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
it you know it it makes the it's a
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
little too prescriptive aside from the
 
00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:21.539 align:start position:0%
25 days does that is that do you share
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
that concern or um I I don't and in all
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
practicality is that that to me would be
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
making the referral you've you've it's
 
00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:30.059 align:start position:0%
you've consulted out with the physician
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
or whoever the appropriate health care
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
provider is the the language does allow
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
for that sort of latitude
 
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
um and I would document that in my that
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
you know I've referred them I've talked
 
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
to the doc and referred oftentimes uh
 
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
depending on on what the situation is so
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know neck pain could be complicated
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
it could be I I may want the primary
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
care to make the decision about whether
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to the neurosurgeon versus
 
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
an orthopedic surgeon so
 
00:23:59.270 --> 00:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's it behooves us to have the
 
00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:01.559 align:start position:0%
communication and to me the referral
 
00:24:03.289 --> 00:24:03.299 align:start position:0%
part is to having that communication
 
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
that goes with it
 
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Palmer
 
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
I'm Murphy thank you thank you Mr
 
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:12.539 align:start position:0%
question I would agree with you
 
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly that an arbitrary number
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
of 25 days is not necessarily an
 
00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:18.539 align:start position:0%
appropriate number nor even the time
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
frame for many you know you've been
 
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
around for 30 years you have had
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
experience with this and therefore your
 
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
experience has taught you a lot
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
when this this concept came up I
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
remember testifying here over 30 years
 
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
ago when we went to a pt1 pt2
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
designation are you is that still in
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
effect right now no as a matter of fact
 
00:24:42.649 --> 00:24:42.659 align:start position:0%
this compromise came out of the bill
 
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
that replaced that with direct
 
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
essentially direct access for physical
 
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
therapy in the state that was
 
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
approximately 15 years ago and I will
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
since being there for as part of that
 
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
this was a compromise with the medical
 
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
world at that point because pt2s
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
who were allowed to have direct access
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
after 30 days it was a hard number
 
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
Improvement or not had to refer had to
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
go back to the the client who did not
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
need a referral to see the physical
 
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
therapist after 30 days even if they
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
only needed one more visit and needed to
 
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
go back to the physician to get a
 
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
referral before Physical Therapy could
 
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.570 align:start position:0%
referral before Physical Therapy could
continue

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
so this was a compromise the 25 days
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
because the Physicians felt that
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
physical therapists still needed to have
 
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
a check-in and have that get back and
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
forth communication and that's really
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
not necessary anymore just a quick
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up sure thank you and I
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
would agree with you with that you have
 
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
a lot of experience you would fall into
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
the pt3 category probably there was one
 
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
I guess my concern is always going to be
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
you know somebody that is does not have
 
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
your experience that they're they have a
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
certain amount of you know
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
um hubris about their capabilities and
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
they don't refer a patient back in
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
because they don't have your experience
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
or maybe not the skill set to diagnose
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
another problem that may be present you
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
know knee pain is not always the knee it
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
could be the back you know that sort of
 
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:04.140 align:start position:0%
thing so I guess that's my concern about
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
the inexperienced therapist that may not
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
or may be able to refer back in so so
 
00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:12.059 align:start position:0%
this is an informational point back back
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
then physical therapists were educated
 
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
at a bachelor's slash Master's level and
 
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
they are now at a clear clinical
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
doctorate level so there is
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
significantly more education
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
particularly around differential
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
diagnosis there is also a significant
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
increase in that time frame that their
 
00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:30.980 align:start position:0%
their education around clinical
 
00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
clinical experience and internships
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
so which is part and parcel of why all
 
00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
of the states now allow direct access
 
00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
for physical therapy in some form there
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
are still some that have some
 
00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
limitations but so those go hand in hand
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
and the ones I would worry about the
 
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
most personally would be the ones who
 
00:26:54.289 --> 00:26:54.299 align:start position:0%
get their degree as a clinical doctorate
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
and just open up down the street and
 
00:26:58.090 --> 00:26:58.100 align:start position:0%
just don't do any
 
00:27:00.409 --> 00:27:00.419 align:start position:0%
you know cooperation with other folks
 
00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
who work with peers if they're most of
 
00:27:03.649 --> 00:27:03.659 align:start position:0%
the time they are working with other
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
peers they're in it oftentimes in a
 
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
hospital or private practice and their
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
colleagues won't
 
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
for their own benefit would not do that
 
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
as a private has a I'm not retired but
 
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
as a private practice owner I can tell
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
you that that was not going to happen so
 
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chairman thank you Ms
 
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
doctor no no I I actually was educated
 
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
back in the days of a bachelor's degree
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
so I wasn't sure if you took that step
 
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
or not um
 
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
I think my questions kind of the two
 
00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
questions I asked earlier were actually
 
00:27:42.649 --> 00:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
for you I kind of got that
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
I've been working with you folks for a
 
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
long time I'm just curious do you
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
believe you have the expertise to know
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
when it's time to ask for help from a
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
doctor and and put yourself at year one
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
year 30 or 15 whatever
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
um I I would my answer would be
 
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
unequivocally yes
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
um and part of that is based on
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
um recently
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
um well six years ago that our our
 
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
practice had hired a new grad and while
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
they may not have they were not
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily asking a doc at that point
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
they were very very concerned about
 
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
discussing with us as colleagues the the
 
00:28:21.649 --> 00:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
office had seven therapists and it
 
00:28:24.049 --> 00:28:24.059 align:start position:0%
discussing with us questions and and
 
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:26.220 align:start position:0%
concerns and if any of us had seen
 
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
something so there was always a teaching
 
00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:30.419 align:start position:0%
moment as part of that and then about
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
three years ago we also had another
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
relatively new grad and the same
 
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
experience so there there really are
 
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
taught that and the bottom line is if
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
they are not able to make a change or
 
00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
not able to
 
00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:45.299 align:start position:0%
to discern something that really is
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
appropriate for physical therapy then
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
the training is they need to go on to
 
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
I'll set representative Weber
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
so I just want to go back to the issue
 
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
of the new practitioners
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
um am I right in thinking that just as a
 
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
new attorney is required ethically and
 
00:29:14.289 --> 00:29:14.299 align:start position:0%
under the Licensing Laws to either
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
associate themselves educate themselves
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
find somebody else to work with if they
 
00:29:24.889 --> 00:29:24.899 align:start position:0%
are in a situation that is beyond what
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
they are competent to do and they're the
 
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
person who judges
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
but the malpractice board is always
 
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
there over their shoulder so isn't it
 
00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
true that just as in many licensed
 
00:29:38.279 --> 00:29:40.750 align:start position:0%
true that just as in many licensed
professions

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
professions
 
00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
every physical therapist has that same
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
duty of what I would call collegiality
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
and consultation
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
at any time that they are out of their
 
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.430 align:start position:0%
at any time that they are out of their
depth

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
depth
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
and so whether they are Consulting with
 
00:29:59.690 --> 00:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
another physical therapist or
 
00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
referring somebody to an MD
 
00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
um they have that obligation from moment
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
one anyway is that not true that is that
 
00:30:15.409 --> 00:30:15.419 align:start position:0%
is absolutely true and we also as part
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
of our Licensing Laws we all are
 
00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:19.559 align:start position:0%
required to do a continuing education
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
and take courses on a regular basis it's
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
one of the good things that came out of
 
00:30:27.649 --> 00:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
the PT's getting direct access prior to
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
the that with PT ones and pt2s part of
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
them did not have to do continuing
 
00:30:33.769 --> 00:30:33.779 align:start position:0%
education now every physical therapist
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
has to do that continuing education on a
 
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
regular basis I thank you for that
 
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:39.769 align:start position:0%
regular basis I thank you for that
question

00:30:39.769 --> 00:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions so thank you
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
very much you're welcome
 
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:50.700 align:start position:0%

for this bill earlier so it didn't feel
awesome

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:40.380 align:start position:0%

representative Merchant for his hard
 
00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:48.260 align:start position:0%
work this past summer regarding
 
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
258 putting together the Forefront of uh
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
bringing to the Forefront the opioid
 
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.029 align:start position:0%
bringing to the Forefront the opioid
crisis

00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
thank you I would also like to thank
 
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
representative Dr David Nagel for his
 
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
assistance on this bill
 
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
um before I get started I'd like to
 
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
share a brief story about
 
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
the opioid crisis I a woman that I had
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
met was suffering of back pain
 
00:33:18.649 --> 00:33:18.659 align:start position:0%
I was prescribed opioids for for pain in
 
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
which she continued to take them for as
 
00:33:23.049 --> 00:33:23.059 align:start position:0%
long as permissible
 
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:26.940 align:start position:0%
uh when those meds stopped working she
 
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
turned to heroin
 
00:33:30.649 --> 00:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
she lost her family her business and
 
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
almost all her life
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
due to the grace of God she was able to
 
00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:37.019 align:start position:0%
recover and get back with her family
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
the reason for the story is that she had
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
related to me had she known about
 
00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
Alternative Care for back pain she would
 
00:33:48.889 --> 00:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
have given it a try
 
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
HB 554 deals with evidence-based
 
00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:54.539 align:start position:0%
treatment of chronic pain utilizing
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
Alternative Care
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
I believe the opioid crisis in large
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
part the consequence of the absence of
 
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
effective affordable Alternative Care
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
available to residents of New Hampshire
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
for the treatment of pain
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
every leading medical profession in this
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
country including the Joint Commission
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
on opioid abuse has recommended
 
00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:17.300 align:start position:0%
Alternative Care is cost efficient
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
effective means of dealing with this
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
opioid crisis
 
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
Alternative Care is only performed by
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
duly licensed practitioners in the state
 
00:34:28.849 --> 00:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
uh regarding Insurance there would be no
 
00:34:35.089 --> 00:34:35.099 align:start position:0%
increase in Insurance costs as long as
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
these practitioners are already
 
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
prescribers for participating insurance
 
00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.690 align:start position:0%
prescribers for participating insurance
providers

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
this bill is giving the patients the
 
00:34:43.859 --> 00:34:44.990 align:start position:0%
this bill is giving the patients the
choice

00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
whether the seek Alternative Care
 
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
or rather than prescribed medications
 
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
in closing
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
the reason this bill is necessary is due
 
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
to the over-reliance on Pharmaceuticals
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
specifically opioids
 
00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
it is a condition that has been created
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
by over prescription and or abuse of
 
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
opioids within the medical community
 
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
I realize we do need to have medications
 
00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:17.660 align:start position:0%
available but I also think that the
 
00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
let the patient choose how they want to
 
00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:24.740 align:start position:0%
get their care
 
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
I conclude my testimony because I know
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
you folks are really busy I've included
 
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
in the pack a unapproved amendment to
 
00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.030 align:start position:0%
in the pack a unapproved amendment to
554

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
554
 
00:35:43.329 --> 00:35:43.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
sections in the bill
 
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
mainly on page
 
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.310 align:start position:0%
mainly on page
one

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:55.079 align:start position:0%
six and seven would be eliminated
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:08.579 align:start position:0%
on page two number 31 and eliminate yoga
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
therapy and replace it with physical
 
00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:14.030 align:start position:0%
therapy and replace it with physical
therapy

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
um and on page three
 
00:36:19.609 --> 00:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
number five uh eliminate the yoga
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
therapy replace it with physical therapy
 
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
same page number three uh number nine uh
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
eliminating when awarded by health care
 
00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
for practitioner
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
would take care of the amendment
 
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.050 align:start position:0%
would take care of the amendment
um

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
the letters that I sent around to are
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
from a couple patients of mine at uh
 
00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:52.140 align:start position:0%
were have it heavily into opioids
 
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
uh and have
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
realized that their Alternative Care has
 
00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.490 align:start position:0%
realized that their Alternative Care has
helped

00:36:58.490 --> 00:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
helped
 
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.230 align:start position:0%
helped
um

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
and if I have
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
the ability to answer any questions I'd
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
be happy to right now thank you
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
for bringing this bill to us my question
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
is about the insurance coverage sections
 
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
in this bill and if those are
 
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:20.099 align:start position:0%
essentially the same as House Bill 303
 
00:37:22.609 --> 00:37:22.619 align:start position:0%
which is in Commerce because I I know
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
that insurance coverage is a little bit
 
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
different than health policy so I was
 
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
curious if you were we would be willing
 
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
to remove the coverage section and defer
 
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
to the bill that's in Commerce
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
I I'd I'd be willing to look at that I
 
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
don't know about 303 so I'd have to look
 
00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
at that but yes thank you thank you
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative Weber
 
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you and and if you could I'm
 
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
having a little trouble meshing
 
00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
this bill with what I'm seeing in the
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
current statutes
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
um I I add I see that you've
 
00:38:03.839 --> 00:38:06.829 align:start position:0%
um I I add I see that you've
added

00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
if if there are definitions and I
 
00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
haven't looked them up in 126a
 
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
I think by uh this
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
by inserting after section 88 the
 
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
following new subdivision you are
 
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
getting rid of all the definitions that
 
00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:25.700 align:start position:0%
are in the current
 
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
126 a colon 89 because they have the
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
same number
 
00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
unless I'm in the wrong place
 
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:41.510 align:start position:0%
um and
then

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
so you're going from the definitions
 
00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:46.140 align:start position:0%
that are already there which are
 
00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
extensive just down to two
 
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
and then 126 a 90 appears to me to be to
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
replace in its entirely the controlled
 
00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.310 align:start position:0%
replace in its entirely the controlled
prescription

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
health and safety program and I'm I'm
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
assuming that was not your intent and
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
this is perhaps a numbering
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
issue correct so but but that was not
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
your intent so we need to figure out
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
about the numbering is that correct
 
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
that'd be good okay thank you and I was
 
00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:21.500 align:start position:0%
going to ask with your Indulgence yes
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%

representative

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:52.490 align:start position:0%
you representative
um

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
first of all I I have a an amendment
 
00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:58.140 align:start position:0%
that came around but it I have one page
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
oh and it stops abruptly so I'm assuming
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
that there's more that we don't have or
 
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
at least that I don't have no I'm sorry
 
00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:06.710 align:start position:0%
at least that I don't have no I'm sorry
um

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
and while you're handing that to the
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative I will ask you another
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
question it appears that the and again I
 
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:19.140 align:start position:0%
may be wrong but it it appears that the
 
00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:21.980 align:start position:0%
amendment adds rulemaking Authority
 
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
whereas the original bill as introduced
 
00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
does not
 
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
include rulemaking Authority am I do I
 
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
see that correctly uh
 
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
you know I mean I I brought that to
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
um legislative Services okay and told
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
them that I wanted to have a few things
 
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
removed so I don't know how to answer
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
that okay I'll and and I'll have to
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
having just got the amendment I'll have
 
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
to read it more more thoroughly and do a
 
00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:49.790 align:start position:0%
to read it more more thoroughly and do a
comparison

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
um in in uh just a a note of
 
00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
appreciation to our committee researcher
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
Who provided a a wealth of information
 
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
in the memo here cool thank you
 
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Palazzo
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh-huh thank you Mr Chen thank you for
 
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh uh I like the idea
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
of giving a choice to patients my
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
concern is uh so the main premise we are
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
trying to solve with some uh pain
 
00:43:23.809 --> 00:43:23.819 align:start position:0%
management doesn't work there's a risk
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
that patience will turn to things like
 
00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.990 align:start position:0%
that patience will turn to things like
heroin

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
heroin
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
but my concern is like it can happen
 
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
with this alternative chips too if
 
00:43:38.089 --> 00:43:38.099 align:start position:0%
alternative pain management doesn't work
 
00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:41.060 align:start position:0%
there's still a risk that patient
 
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
will turn to some still drugs and my
 
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
question is like is a mechanism to
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
quickly switch like if like Physical
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
Therapy doesn't work uh can a patient
 
00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:56.180 align:start position:0%
quickly switch to
 
00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:57.849 align:start position:0%
quickly switch to
some

00:43:57.849 --> 00:43:57.859 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical options for pain
 
00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
management thank you uh yes
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill would be for the
 
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
treating physician to offer Alternative
 
00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.450 align:start position:0%
treating physician to offer Alternative
Care

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
Care
 
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
at a maybe a
 
00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
10 visit
 
00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.670 align:start position:0%
10 visit
uh

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
treatment period
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
I'm just throwing that number out uh
 
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
reporting back to the physician as to
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
how things are going
 
00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
so yeah yes representative McLean thank
 
00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and uh thank you for taking
 
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
um and my question is just kind of
 
00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
stemming out of a little bit of
 
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
ignorance and trying to understand some
 
00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
of the sausage making so the back end of
 
00:44:46.849 --> 00:44:46.859 align:start position:0%
the bill deals a lot of with the
 
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
insurance and the coverage and those
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
kind of aspects of it so once you
 
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
accomplish that
 
00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:54.190 align:start position:0%
accomplish that
um

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
is I'm I'm going back to the the
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
voluntary non-opioid directive form once
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
you incorporate the the coverage what is
 
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
what is the necessity for that and and
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
what would it look like um because once
 
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
you have the coverage I would assume
 
00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
doctors would already be allowed to
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
um go forward with this so just trying
 
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I really don't understand the
 
00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
question so let me see if I can answer
 
00:45:28.849 --> 00:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
it uh if possible so if if a patient is
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
referred to an another uh Alternative
 
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
Care and the coverage is uh provided by
 
00:45:38.809 --> 00:45:38.819 align:start position:0%
the insurance that they have
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
without having to pay for it other than
 
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
the normal deductible
 
00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
did that answer that well no um so I
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
understand that because the the bill
 
00:45:56.089 --> 00:45:56.099 align:start position:0%
introduces coverage so now things which
 
00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
maybe were not covered in the past are
 
00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
now covered so having accomplished that
 
00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:02.780 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
at the very front end of it is talking
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
about real rule making and the
 
00:46:10.609 --> 00:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
establishment of a voluntary non-opioid
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
directive form
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just wondering why is the
 
00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
establishment of that form necessary
 
00:46:20.089 --> 00:46:20.099 align:start position:0%
what would it what what would it look
 
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
like having allowed for the coverage why
 
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
not just go forward why do you need to
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
have the rulemaking and the form so that
 
00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
was my question
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
good question and I I think that that
 
00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
probably should be worked on again with
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
other things that are popping up uh I'm
 
00:46:40.079 --> 00:46:42.530 align:start position:0%
other things that are popping up uh I'm
sorry

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.089 --> 00:46:47.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
so and I'm I'm I apologize for sort of
 
00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:51.560 align:start position:0%
nitpicking here but I think that there's
 
00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
very good
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
Concepts behind this bill and I'm just
 
00:46:58.809 --> 00:46:58.819 align:start position:0%
trying to pick out
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
how to deal with them
 
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.730 align:start position:0%
how to deal with them
um

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:03.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:08.589 --> 00:47:08.599 align:start position:0%
it the bill is about non-opi directives
 
00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
and the first
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph just talks about treatment and
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
then it says the health care
 
00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
practitioner shall honor the non-opioid
 
00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
directive but you haven't talked about
 
00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:22.700 align:start position:0%
the non-opioid directive yet
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
and if I'm understanding the
 
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
commissioner is supposed to adopt rules
 
00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:32.750 align:start position:0%
commissioner is supposed to adopt rules
uh

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:35.579 align:start position:0%
starting with a standard form but you
 
00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:38.460 align:start position:0%
took the standard form out if I have
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
crossed out the right thing so I guess
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
my question is is there somewhere here
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
that I have missed that actually has the
 
00:47:50.569 --> 00:47:50.579 align:start position:0%
words that create the non-opioid
 
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
directive before we start either
 
00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
honoring it or making rules about it no
 
00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
that okay you're right
 
00:48:01.849 --> 00:48:01.859 align:start position:0%
thank you no I'm sorry
 
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay I'm seeing no other questions
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify on House Bill
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
554 is representative Tom Dolan also
 
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
from Londonderry
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thank you
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
colleagues for hearing my testimony uh
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
this is I'll be very brief
 
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
uh and I want to give a special thanks
 
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
to Dr David Lundgren for following this
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
issue for now it seems like several
 
00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
years trying to get it uh through the
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
various wickets this is very important
 
00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
and I have uh some anecdotal information
 
00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.910 align:start position:0%
and I have uh some anecdotal information
about

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:25.859 align:start position:0%
things called narcam parties if you
 
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
haven't heard that term yet uh I'm not
 
00:49:30.849 --> 00:49:30.859 align:start position:0%
sure how germane it is to this bill so
 
00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
I'll I will
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
offer those that story if you so
 
00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
requests but I won't uh go down that
 
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
road yet
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh I wanted to discuss uh testimony of
 
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
from Dr Paul Reynolds who is a 1978
 
00:49:58.990 --> 00:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
graduate of West Point in a special
 
00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:02.220 align:start position:0%
doctor of pain management he resides in
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
California so the the drive to come
 
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:08.099 align:start position:0%
testimony was a little long today so I'm
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
kind of subbing for that uh that
 
00:50:14.329 --> 00:50:14.339 align:start position:0%
opportunity he wrote I passed around a
 
00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
short article to his local Knights of
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
Columbus on this topic and I wanted to
 
00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
read it to you
 
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
apparently people cannot avoid using
 
00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
narcotics for longer than is good for
 
00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:26.210 align:start position:0%
narcotics for longer than is good for
them

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:26.220 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
also apparently not if doctors are aware
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
of the prescribing drug drug habits can
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
be a major problem many of us can look
 
00:50:38.089 --> 00:50:38.099 align:start position:0%
at our own medicine cabinets
 
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
and find
 
00:50:41.809 --> 00:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
representative of you just reading the
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
testimony you've given us sir yeah we
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
can we can do that if you just want to
 
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
summarize and that would be you know
 
00:50:50.569 --> 00:50:50.579 align:start position:0%
that'll be okay this the summary is that
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
that people have uh what I'll call
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
leftover pain medicine that's been
 
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
prescribed uh usually hanging around
 
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
their medicine cabinets and they end up
 
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
taking these medicines uh
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
inappropriately and long after the the
 
00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
need for them is uh as subsided and what
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
this particular doctor has pointed out
 
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
to me is that
 
00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:19.619 align:start position:0%
something I didn't realize is that the
 
00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
body when it needs pain relief makes a
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
opioid-like substance and uh and kind of
 
00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
takes care of itself so by taking these
 
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
opioid opioids it actually suppresses
 
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
the body's own ability to produce these
 
00:51:41.049 --> 00:51:41.059 align:start position:0%
substances and therefore care for itself
 
00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
various things can happen like get it
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
getting hooked on these things and
 
00:51:49.849 --> 00:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
having to deal with another doctor to
 
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
help wean them off or prescribe
 
00:51:56.329 --> 00:51:56.339 align:start position:0%
something else and many folks are not
 
00:51:58.930 --> 00:51:58.940 align:start position:0%
aware that over-the-counter
 
00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:02.540 align:start position:0%
anti-inflammatories like Motrin Advil uh
 
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
Aleve and so forth do quite well to
 
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:10.740 align:start position:0%
relieve some of these pain instances so
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure the doctors focus a
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
little bit more on on those Solutions
 
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
rather than the the opioids that are
 
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
prescribed so uh with that Mr chairman I
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
I I'm open for questions and if you want
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
to hear about those Narcan parties I'm
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
prepared to talk to that too it showed
 
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
itself in the Manchester fire department
 
00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:34.549 align:start position:0%
itself in the Manchester fire department
recently

00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if I may yeah my suggestion
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
is that I think that all the people on
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
this committee being the Health and
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
Human Services committee are aware that
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
there is a very severe crisis with
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
respect to opioids and that the the real
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
issue that we that I would want to hear
 
00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
about is uh as is this bill suggestions
 
00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:00.780 align:start position:0%
for remediating it rather than the
 
00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:02.339 align:start position:0%
depths the crisis which we all know
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
about okay representative Nagel
 
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
um a little you kind of stole my thank
 
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:11.579 align:start position:0%
cloud you kind of stole my thunder I
 
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
think we really need to get back to what
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
the bill is about
 
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
um but I did have some important things
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
that I think need to Enlighten and I
 
00:53:20.569 --> 00:53:20.579 align:start position:0%
just have a I'm curious do you know and
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I don't mean to put you on the spot
 
00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
but I am
 
00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
um do you know what the likelihood of
 
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.220 align:start position:0%
developing an addiction to
 
00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.290 align:start position:0%
developing an addiction to
um

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
um opioids if you prescribe them for the
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of chronic pain I don't know
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
and you know what the likelihood that
 
00:53:43.609 --> 00:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
you're going to develop an addiction
 
00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
when you're prescribed opioids for acute
 
00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
pain no and do you know what the like
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not a physician it's all
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
right I I just think these are important
 
00:53:53.569 --> 00:53:53.579 align:start position:0%
issues that I needed to raise because I
 
00:53:56.089 --> 00:53:56.099 align:start position:0%
think we did lose focus thank you other
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
questions yes yes I can answer them what
 
00:54:01.089 --> 00:54:01.099 align:start position:0%

00:54:38.089 --> 00:54:38.099 align:start position:0%
personal experience you know back in my

late teens and early 20s uh I had uh
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
like three three knee reconstructions
 
00:54:47.569 --> 00:54:47.579 align:start position:0%
and eventually ended up having a a knee
 
00:54:50.089 --> 00:54:50.099 align:start position:0%
replaced but uh in the middle of that uh
 
00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of back injuries because
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
I was nursing the knee and and what have
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
I've been a member of Alcoholics
 
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous for 32
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
years I've seen a lot of a lot of
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
families destroyed
 
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
um you know I've seen uh you know six
 
00:55:21.049 --> 00:55:21.059 align:start position:0%
four 275 pound bikers were reduced to a
 
00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
puddle of Tears uh because of this uh
 
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
I've seen doctors I've seen lawyers I've
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
seen CEOs uh you know coming coming out
 
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
of surgery and uh you know they they get
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
shut off from their opioids and uh the
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
next thing you know that they're chasing
 
00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
things on the street and uh you know
 
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
it's it's a serious problem you know
 
00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:40.970 align:start position:0%
it's it's a serious problem you know
um

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
to have a doctor you know uh just all
 
00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much what this is in the
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
beginning was uh you know just just tell
 
00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
people that you know there's alternative
 
00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
therapies rather than going right to
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
opioids you know uh a couple years ago I
 
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
broke my back I fell out of a tree stand
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
while I was hunting it was an icy tree
 
00:55:59.150 --> 00:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
stand it wasn't my brightest move
 
00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:01.140 align:start position:0%
getting in it in the first place but but
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know I uh you know I went to the
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
hospital and and they prescribed opioids
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
for me you know the next day I went to a
 
00:56:11.569 --> 00:56:11.579 align:start position:0%
an orthopedic surgeon and they gave me
 
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
stronger opioids you know and and having
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
my experience uh you know I know I
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't want to go down this road
 
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
uh I had to take them for a few days you
 
00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
know but uh I uh I ended up going to my
 
00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
chiropractor you know and um you know we
 
00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
uh he did uh like electrical muscle
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
stimuli stimulation on the area that was
 
00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
broken and uh he uh he gave me a a TENS
 
00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh unit they call it and uh it's a thing
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
about the size of the pink cards you've
 
00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
got there and uh you know runs on a nine
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
volt battery and uh gives you know small
 
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
areas of electrical muscle stimulation
 
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
trust me that that saved me for another
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
saved me from another opioid addiction
 
00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:56.339 align:start position:0%
okay uh it's just a little Alternative
 
00:56:59.390 --> 00:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
Care thing you know and if a if the
 
00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:00.900 align:start position:0%
orthopedic surgeon had said you know
 
00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
instead of the opioids try this you know
 
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
or I'll give you a few days worth of
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
opioids you know uh uh I would have been
 
00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
a whole lot more comfortable you know I
 
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
don't ever want to be you know that that
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
that blubbering guy sitting there you
 
00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:17.819 align:start position:0%
know crying and doing wanting to die you
 
00:57:20.329 --> 00:57:20.339 align:start position:0%
know my my family uh you know deserting
 
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
me you know my my kids don't want me all
 
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff that's that's the
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff that uh you know that
 
00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
opioids do and uh anything we can do to
 
00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:32.460 align:start position:0%
uh to to avoid that uh is is
 
00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:34.740 align:start position:0%
I think we have to do it you know
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
naturally it gets tied up in all kinds
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
of complexities here you know who's
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
going to pay and all the rest of it but
 
00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
uh I know for me that uh that little
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
TENS unit probably saved my insurance
 
00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:47.940 align:start position:0%
company uh you know a a 30-day stay in a
 
00:57:50.809 --> 00:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
rehab uh maybe some additional rehab uh
 
00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking to over a hundred thousand
 
00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
um you know uh we're not we're not
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
talking big big charges on the insurance
 
00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
company here uh just an alternative to
 
00:58:07.609 --> 00:58:07.619 align:start position:0%

directive form do you think that there's
a

00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
um that there's value to having the
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
physician get in the habit of offering
 
00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
um the non-opioids first
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
by having them have this form
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
as far as the form goes a lot of a lot
 
00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
of medical practitioners now uh practice
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
cover you but medicine that a form like
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
this which would save
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
any lawsuits from from happening you
 
00:59:10.609 --> 00:59:10.619 align:start position:0%
know you you know yes you have been
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
informed and here's your signature on it
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
um you know I think it's a great idea
 
00:59:20.329 --> 00:59:20.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
see your hand down here
 
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:26.220 align:start position:0%
other questions I see none okay thank
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
00:59:48.289 --> 00:59:48.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:48.299 --> 00:59:52.670 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
welcome back to what I understand is
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
your former committee representative
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much it is nice to be
 
01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
back for the record Jerry Canuck
 
01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:03.980 align:start position:0%
um former has been representative
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
and uh I also uh am a orthopedic spine
 
01:00:11.329 --> 01:00:11.339 align:start position:0%
surgeon retired and uh serve as the
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
chair of the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board
 
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to deviate a bit from my
 
01:00:18.289 --> 01:00:18.299 align:start position:0%
written testimony because I haven't
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of this stuff HB 554 is
 
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
essentially the same as HB 247 from 2021
 
01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
which we was retained and then went to
 
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
interim study and I chaired the room
 
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
study subcommittee on that
 
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
um there are a lot of structural issues
 
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
that have already been brought up in
 
01:00:38.089 --> 01:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
this hearing by representative Weber and
 
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
others a couple of things I would just
 
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
say and those uh the amendment I had a
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
chance to see it but eliminating yoga is
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
probably reasonable we had concerns
 
01:00:47.329 --> 01:00:47.339 align:start position:0%
about nine licensed providers being
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
included as being mandated to be
 
01:00:49.319 --> 01:00:50.870 align:start position:0%
included as being mandated to be
reimbursed

01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursed
 
01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.470 align:start position:0%
reimbursed
um

01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
regarding representative Leon's comment
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't recommend itl on this bill
 
01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
and just going with HB 303 because I
 
01:00:59.690 --> 01:00:59.700 align:start position:0%
think a policy committee should weigh in
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
on the importance of coverage
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
um not just leaving it to the people
 
01:01:05.809 --> 01:01:05.819 align:start position:0%
that are looking at it as a business
 
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
because this is actually taking care of
 
01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.690 align:start position:0%
because this is actually taking care of
people

01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
um also the last thing is regarding the
 
01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
conversation about does offering
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
coverage make a change providers are
 
01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:17.579 align:start position:0%
often very slow to change and we saw how
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
long it took us to get providers to come
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
on board just dealing with the opioid
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
epidemic to begin with
 
01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
um one important change in this bill is
 
01:01:28.849 --> 01:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
on page one line ten when the word may
 
01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
is used because in HP 247 the word shell
 
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
was used and that was a problem because
 
01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
that then was directive and and
 
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
basically was legislating the practice
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
of medicine that's again page one line
 
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
ten and uh those of us who've been in
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
this committee for more than four years
 
01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:47.099 align:start position:0%
remember a hour-long discussion of the
 
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
importance of May and shell on an elder
 
01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
abuse bill so anyway but the real reason
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
I came though to testify in this was to
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
request that therapeutic cannabis be
 
01:01:59.930 --> 01:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
added to the non-opioid alternatives for
 
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
the management of pain
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
I brought this up during the routine
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
Bill hearing but it didn't get in here
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
so again I serve as the chair of the
 
01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
board that is composed of 10 medical
 
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
providers from different Specialties a
 
01:02:15.289 --> 01:02:15.299 align:start position:0%
uh patient representative the head of
 
01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
the medical director of HHS and also a
 
01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
clinical representative from an ATC and
 
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
we're charged with the statutory
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
oversight of the medical aspects of the
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
a cannabis has been shown to be a
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic value in a number of
 
01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
different things such as pain and PTSD
 
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
but the strongest evidence we have is
 
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
indeed in the management of chronic pain
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
there's a landmark study and by the
 
01:02:40.809 --> 01:02:40.819 align:start position:0%
National Academy of Sciences in 2017
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
that concluded that there's substantial
 
01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
evidence that cannabis is an effective
 
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
treatment for chronic pain in adults
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
period so it's got good evidence and the
 
01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:53.220 align:start position:0%
key is it has a lot fewer risks than
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
opioids cannabis does not cause
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
respiratory depression that's the
 
01:03:00.289 --> 01:03:00.299 align:start position:0%
mechanism of opioid overdose death
 
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
even a short course of opioids may lead
 
01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:06.299 align:start position:0%
to dependence and addiction as many as
 
01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
one in four people receiving
 
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
prescription opioids long term in a
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
primary care setting may become
 
01:03:14.089 --> 01:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
dependent or even addicted to answer
 
01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
that question that was sort of alluded
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
if he could start wrapping up and then
 
01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
we'll ask may I have a little bit more
 
01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
time than that I'm sorry I would not
 
01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:23.930 align:start position:0%
time than that I'm sorry I would not
have

01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
how much do you think you'll need a
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
couple more minutes okay I'll do my best
 
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
can you make it one I'll make it as fast
 
01:03:32.569 --> 01:03:32.579 align:start position:0%
as I can but um anyway the bottom line
 
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
is risk cannabis use disorder is very
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
small in therapeutic cannabis and
 
01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis we are using
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis at a low dose uh trying to get
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
a therapeutic effect without
 
01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
intoxication because that is a side
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
effect which is not desirable we have in
 
01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program uh over
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
70 percent of our patients are certified
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
for treating pain with over 55 percent
 
01:03:56.329 --> 01:03:56.339 align:start position:0%
certified for treating chronic pain
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
which allowed us allows them to lessen
 
01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
the use of opioids 82 percent of our
 
01:04:02.809 --> 01:04:02.819 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients in New
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire report that therapeutic
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis has allowed them to decrease
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
the use of prescription medications
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
I saw this in my own practice as well I
 
01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
retired just before therapy cannabis
 
01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:15.059 align:start position:0%
came in as a spine dock I saw a lot of
 
01:04:17.329 --> 01:04:17.339 align:start position:0%
back pain and I saw patients I inherited
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
on opioids I tried to wean them down
 
01:04:21.049 --> 01:04:21.059 align:start position:0%
rehab program everything couldn't get
 
01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
them off when they went on therapeutic
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
cannabis they were able to go off they
 
01:04:26.270 --> 01:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
did not need it anymore they wouldn't
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
kept up with some of these patients or
 
01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
neighbors and this person was able to
 
01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
just occasionally use a little bit of
 
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
cannabis when he had an episode of pain
 
01:04:36.109 --> 01:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
and didn't fall back into that cycle of
 
01:04:37.849 --> 01:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
dependency again
 
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
but one of the major barriers that our
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients face is
 
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
affordability because it's not covered
 
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
by Insurance patients can access opioids
 
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
cheaply with all of their risks
 
01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
and but they cannot afford that
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis so some of them
 
01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
resort to Black Market cannabis which
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
then they lose the safety of testing and
 
01:04:59.049 --> 01:04:59.059 align:start position:0%
labeling and the counseling of the ATC
 
01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
and that's of course the factors that
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
make it more expensive out of an ATC
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
the so I would really strongly urge the
 
01:05:10.849 --> 01:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
addition of uh to HB 554 of therapeutic
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis is an alternative to opioids
 
01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
given the proven effectiveness of
 
01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis and relieving
 
01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
chronic pain and a risk profile which is
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
better than opioids and I have a little
 
01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
list in the bottom of my testimony it
 
01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
talks about where you might do this to
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
add therapeutic cannabis to the list of
 
01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
things that are offered to be done and
 
01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
then also for the coverage also
 
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
important to realize as written Medicaid
 
01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:35.700 align:start position:0%
Medicare and VA are not included we
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
can't do anything about Medicare and VA
 
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
but we should include this for Medicaid
 
01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
those are the people who are at least
 
01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
likely to be able to afford therapeutic
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis and I'm glad to take any
 
01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:47.579 align:start position:0%
questions thank you questions
 
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
I represented palazzov
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh would you be open
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
uh uh to open it up to provide the uh
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
write the list of uh paying
 
01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:06.670 align:start position:0%
write the list of uh paying
um

01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
for pharmaceuticals that help with pain
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
management uh maybe it's not only uh
 
01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
opioids or cannabioids we know there's
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
some over-the-counter pain management
 
01:06:24.849 --> 01:06:24.859 align:start position:0%
that is not in these two categories
 
01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:28.700 align:start position:0%
it's a specific need to single out uh
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
only cannabinoids in this amendment or
 
01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
if we can open it to avoid the range
 
01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:37.910 align:start position:0%
if we can open it to avoid the range
thinker

01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't thank you very much I'm not
 
01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
sure what needs to because in um lines
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
lines 15 to 17 on page one say by first
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
administering less addictive addictive
 
01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
non-operated medications the the evil
 
01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
with making a list in statute is that
 
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
the medicine changes statutory changes
 
01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
of necessity go slowly so we should not
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
have a list of medications that we put
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
into statute I don't think but not a
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
non-opioid medications are included in
 
01:07:14.089 --> 01:07:14.099 align:start position:0%
this and should be used prior to opioids
 
01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
all I'm asking is that therapeutic
 
01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
cannabis which would be a non-opioid
 
01:07:21.049 --> 01:07:21.059 align:start position:0%
medication would be included in that
 
01:07:21.059 --> 01:07:22.190 align:start position:0%
medication would be included in that
list

01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:24.839 align:start position:0%
and but I mean to be explicitly included
 
01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
because it's not something that would be
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily often thought of it's easy
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
to think of uh Tylenol and Naprosyn but
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of people won't think of
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:07:38.809 --> 01:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
and isn't the reason for uh another
 
01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
reason for including therapeutic
 
01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
cannabis specifically as opposed to the
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
entire range of non-opioids that can
 
01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
either be bought over the counter or
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
prescribed is that it's the one that is
 
01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.190 align:start position:0%
prescribed is that it's the one that is
still

01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
up in the air is to its legal status and
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
and so it falls into a different
 
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
category than all the other
 
01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh non-opioid medications all of which
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
are legal either over the counter and by
 
01:08:11.569 --> 01:08:11.579 align:start position:0%
or by prescription and therefore don't
 
01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
really need to be listed for exactly the
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
same reason you were talking about to
 
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
list one is to include another yes it's
 
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
that easy in the office to quickly write
 
01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
a prescription for Motrin or something
 
01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
um it's a little more cumbersome to
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
certify a patient for therapeutic
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis it is something that we are
 
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
working in therapeutic cannabis medical
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
oversight board to work on our provider
 
01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:33.179 align:start position:0%
education to have more people understand
 
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
how it can be useful but also the other
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
reason to explicitly include it is those
 
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
other drugs are covered unless they're
 
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
over the counter therapeutic cannabis is
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
not and I think it should be
 
01:08:47.809 --> 01:08:47.819 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:52.970 align:start position:0%
taking the question
um

01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
do you foresee
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
um complications and problems with
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
requiring the insurance companies to pay
 
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
for therapeutic cannabis when
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
as as the representative suggested
 
01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.390 align:start position:0%
as as the representative suggested
um

01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
it's kind of in a gray area between
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
legal and non-legal and also because
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's not prescribed by a physician it's
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
um it comes to people through a
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
different mechanism so this is not a
 
01:09:25.849 --> 01:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
reason to not pass a bill but do you
 
01:09:25.859 --> 01:09:26.990 align:start position:0%
reason to not pass a bill but do you
foresee

01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
foresee
 
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
um complications and resistance to
 
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
actually doing this
 
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
yes of course I do it's that's perhaps
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
why it hasn't been done before and I'm
 
01:09:38.209 --> 01:09:38.219 align:start position:0%
certain that Heidi Kroll will make
 
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
comments about this in just a few
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
moments but the bottom line is yes it is
 
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a dicey situation the
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
way I've seen the federal government
 
01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
backing off from enforcement of federal
 
01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
rules in terms of therapeutic cannabis
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
that's been clearly delineated by
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
President Biden but also by various
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
other directives and legal issues in
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
terms of Department of Justice so they
 
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
are not pushing to to enforce the
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
federal rules over so I think the state
 
01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
might have the ability to request that
 
01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
this be done
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
oh thank you representative I'm sorry
 
01:10:13.330 --> 01:10:13.340 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up representation
 
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
question representative knurk
 
01:10:22.729 --> 01:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
who was unwittingly become my role model
 
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
for writing opinions
 
01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.930 align:start position:0%
for writing opinions
um

01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
so you and I have had a lot of
 
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
discussions about these issues over the
 
01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
years and and you know I've been
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
involved with working on these bills for
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
quite a while this bill itself is really
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
about non-pharmacologic options I think
 
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
a lot of what you raise is really
 
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
important but I'm wondering is there a
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
better strategy to doing this than
 
01:10:47.050 --> 01:10:47.060 align:start position:0%
incorporating it within a
 
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
non-farmacologic bill
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
I sort of agree a little bit that's why
 
01:10:54.169 --> 01:10:54.179 align:start position:0%
for example on the on the next one hb66
 
01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
I chose not to weigh in because that was
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
purely non-pharmacologic but this one
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
again in um in lines 15 to 17 does still
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
make reference to other non-opioid
 
01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
medications uh less addictive non-opioid
 
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
medications so that's the one thing that
 
01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
made me think it was still reasonable to
 
01:11:13.729 --> 01:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
attach it to this bill because it did
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
not appear to be purely
 
01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
non-pharmacological but non-opioid
 
01:11:21.169 --> 01:11:21.179 align:start position:0%
that's that was my reasoning
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative Cushman
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
being here uh it's nice to see you
 
01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering do you have any idea I
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
don't have an updated fiscal note for
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering what requiring
 
01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
coverage of these
 
01:11:44.770 --> 01:11:44.780 align:start position:0%
um alternative
 
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
therapies will how that will affect the
 
01:11:51.169 --> 01:11:51.179 align:start position:0%
insurance rates for private insurance
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
payers in New Hampshire
 
01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea oh well I would
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
defer on some of that too Miss Crowell
 
01:11:58.970 --> 01:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
who can answer that probably better than
 
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
I but there is important to understand
 
01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
how much impact we may have to be able
 
01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
to decrease other costs
 
01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
um there have been some good comments
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
made earlier uh the addiction issue and
 
01:12:12.649 --> 01:12:12.659 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation is a problem but also a
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
lot of the interventions we use when we
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
decide to do you know facet block
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
injections those aren't cheap tens units
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
aren't 100 bucks either they're a lot
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
more money than that so the if we can
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
save those kinds of costs that'd be fine
 
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
the patient that I alluded to that was
 
01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
an old patient of mine uses very little
 
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
cannabis but it keeps them out of that
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
cycle he went through an enormous amount
 
01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
of other interventions over the years
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
before he found that that actually gave
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
him this relief that he needed so there
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
there should be some real cost savings
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
clearly though if we do add Medicaid
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
that will increase in terms of a fiscal
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
note that would increase the state's
 
01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
responsibility because that's from us
 
01:12:54.890 --> 01:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
for the insurers whether there might be
 
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
some upward pressure on premiums I'm not
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
sure that there would be I think it
 
01:13:02.689 --> 01:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:02.699 --> 01:13:09.550 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
are you too young for that
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
well I have a new baby so that's my
 
01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
thing that's true
 
01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:18.830 align:start position:0%
thing that's true
um

01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
I wanted to ask you
 
01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:23.570 align:start position:0%
I wanted to ask you
sure

01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
my question is if you had a choice as I
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
think as I think we have
 
01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.649 align:start position:0%
think as I think we have
between

01:13:38.649 --> 01:13:38.659 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
uh passing a bill
 
01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:45.260 align:start position:0%
directing people's attention towards
 
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
using non-opioids first
 
01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
and having a bill founder on the issue
 
01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
of the legality and insurance coverage
 
01:13:58.010 --> 01:13:58.020 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid coverage for therapeutic
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis which would you choose
 
01:14:03.290 --> 01:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
I would actually choose neither I put a
 
01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
I would think you know the severability
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
Clause that that if because this may
 
01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
change but in in essence in terms of
 
01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
your question I think it's a great
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
Devil's Advocate question I would choose
 
01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
getting this passed without therapeutic
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis because it's important that
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
this be passed and and just as a quick
 
01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:23.649 align:start position:0%
this be passed and and just as a quick
follow-up

01:14:23.649 --> 01:14:23.659 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:14:26.689 --> 01:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
would you recognize that usually
 
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
severability Clauses apply to whole
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
chunks and not
 
01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
eliminating pieces here and there
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
um that's probably true but uh you know
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
I just don't know if it could be
 
01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
structured that way or not I
 
01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:43.140 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you but I wouldn't want it
 
01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
the key is to get where you're getting
 
01:14:46.729 --> 01:14:46.739 align:start position:0%
at I wouldn't want therapeutic cannabis
 
01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
to torpedo this bill bottom line
 
01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
another another question okay
 
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
representative uh Cushman thank you Mr
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
chairman I remember
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of any funds
 
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
um that have come from
 
01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
lawsuits against those who have kind of
 
01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
instigated and perpetuated the opioid
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
epidemic if there are any state funds
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
that maybe could be used to offset
 
01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
the costs to either a private insurance
 
01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
payers or maybe the cost if we were to
 
01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
add it to Medicaid you know anything
 
01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:21.900 align:start position:0%
about that I don't have any knowledge of
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
how the settlement funds are being used
 
01:15:24.719 --> 01:15:26.209 align:start position:0%
how the settlement funds are being used
uh

01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:26.219 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
nor do I have any capability to direct
 
01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:30.709 align:start position:0%
nor do I have any capability to direct
that

01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
sure you know about a lot of things
 
01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
going on so I just figured maybe you had
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
some understanding of how that all have
 
01:15:38.209 --> 01:15:38.219 align:start position:0%
not did thank you
 
01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:41.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other questions okay thank
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you good to see you
 
01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:50.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify is Dr Mark
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to get back to the specifics
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh and unfortunately it appears that
 
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's cut into my time uh I am the past
 
01:16:24.169 --> 01:16:24.179 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire
 
01:16:26.570 --> 01:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic Association
 
01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
I'm also from Londonderry as others here
 
01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
in the room are have been in practice
 
01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:33.900 align:start position:0%
for 36 years
 
01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
I've been working on this legislation
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
and like it for over eight years now I
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
carry this
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
headline from the union leader from
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
January of 2014 with me as a reminder
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
when I first started testifying on this
 
01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:51.900 align:start position:0%
type of legislation
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
I've worked with the governor's advisors
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
James Vara
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
um Marty Bolden
 
01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
and Dave Myra on this uh this effort to
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
work on these this this crisis and I
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
know we don't have to talk about the
 
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
fact that it is a crisis and you won't
 
01:17:13.010 --> 01:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
get any any stories for me I believe I
 
01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
have some answers to Representatives
 
01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
Weber Murphy uh and cushman's points
 
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:20.940 align:start position:0%
earlier as well if I'm given the chance
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
to uh to speak on that
 
01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
you I distributed some information to
 
01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:27.590 align:start position:0%
you I distributed some information to
you

01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
prior to one of them looks like this
 
01:17:34.090 --> 01:17:34.100 align:start position:0%
studies on non-opioids and the other one
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
says non-pharmacologics that's just to
 
01:17:41.689 --> 01:17:41.699 align:start position:0%
give you a sample of the research that
 
01:17:45.130 --> 01:17:45.140 align:start position:0%
has been ongoing for years now
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
so oftentimes the question comes up you
 
01:17:51.729 --> 01:17:51.739 align:start position:0%
know relative to the legitimacy of these
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
non-pharmacologic approaches and that's
 
01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
just the sampling and and there's a
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
couple of these studies that have come
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
out of New Hampshire one out of
 
01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College which is used across
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
the country I won't go into the details
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
because it appears I don't have the time
 
01:18:08.330 --> 01:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
and one actually was commissioned by
 
01:18:11.290 --> 01:18:11.300 align:start position:0%
this legislature to look into
 
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
this this issue in some of our previous
 
01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:16.630 align:start position:0%
this this issue in some of our previous
attempts

01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
attempts
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
these Studies have been looked at by
 
01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
other major organizations for years
 
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
the the result that has come out of that
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
is that the CDC FDA The Institute of
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
medicine The Joint Commission the
 
01:18:33.649 --> 01:18:33.659 align:start position:0%
American College of Physicians the
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
Veterans Administration and the Canadian
 
01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
Medical Association have all strongly
 
01:18:42.669 --> 01:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
encouraged the incorporation of these
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
non-pharmacologic procedures early key
 
01:18:49.630 --> 01:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
early in the treatment of the patient
 
01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:53.219 align:start position:0%
and so I think that speaks well to the
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
science that's behind this in the in in
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
the need and the necessity for it we've
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
lost years of valuable time in the state
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
when other states have moved ahead on
 
01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
this this legislation as I understand it
 
01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
is is modeled after legislation that's
 
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
been in place in West Virginia for
 
01:19:17.209 --> 01:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
several years now and it it'll also give
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
some reason to the need for the
 
01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:20.699 align:start position:0%
directive as it's combined with the
 
01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
insurance which I'd like to you know
 
01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
make sure that we enter to that
 
01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
appropriately but we have we've lost a
 
01:19:28.729 --> 01:19:28.739 align:start position:0%
lot of time and and I hope that we
 
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
finally are in a position where we can
 
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
move forward on this
 
01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:33.490 align:start position:0%
move forward on this
um

01:19:33.490 --> 01:19:33.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
these states was are seeing positive
 
01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
changes uh and that's not it's Ohio
 
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
Vermont West Virginia Rhode Island
 
01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
Oregon they've all passed legislation
 
01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
that has moved this type of
 
01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:47.890 align:start position:0%
that has moved this type of
um

01:19:47.890 --> 01:19:47.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh action further forward and and really
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's about our patients
 
01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
um and and it's about getting our
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
patients the adequate care they need
 
01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
particularly The Chronic pain patient
 
01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to just say a little
 
01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
something about the insurance component
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
on this uh we've been working on this an
 
01:20:10.729 --> 01:20:10.739 align:start position:0%
awful long time as well
 
01:20:10.739 --> 01:20:11.390 align:start position:0%
awful long time as well
um

01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
so the the two key components is we've
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
kind of sat down and looked at this
 
01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
and one pertains to the directive now
 
01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
determine what the directive
 
01:20:26.209 --> 01:20:26.219 align:start position:0%
specifically looks like this is probably
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
going to be up to you people to decide
 
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
what's the best Avenue but all the
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
research has indicated and someone made
 
01:20:35.209 --> 01:20:35.219 align:start position:0%
the comment about the physician it's not
 
01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
wrapping up but yeah slow to change but
 
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman thank you but the
 
01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
directive is to make sure that a
 
01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
conversation takes place between the
 
01:20:49.370 --> 01:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
patient and the physician that these
 
01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
alternative options are available this
 
01:20:54.410 --> 01:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
has not been happening as a whole
 
01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
the insurance components of this
 
01:21:00.770 --> 01:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
legislation and undoubtedly as we've
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
always seen in the past the insurance
 
01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
lobbyists are going to come in and
 
01:21:06.490 --> 01:21:06.500 align:start position:0%
they're going to raise some doubts as to
 
01:21:09.649 --> 01:21:09.659 align:start position:0%
the the amount of research that's
 
01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
available of the cost as as it has been
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
asked you know how much is this going to
 
01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
raise costs there have been many cost
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
analysis done on this and they they all
 
01:21:22.610 --> 01:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
support the savings that is provided but
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
one of the primary things that happens
 
01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire that is
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to occur is these insurance
 
01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:31.310 align:start position:0%
allowed to occur is these insurance
carriers

01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
carriers
 
01:21:34.669 --> 01:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
are allowed to sell a product that
 
01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
includes Chiropractic services and
 
01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
they'll say oh you know we we provide it
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
but then the patient arrives at our
 
01:21:45.169 --> 01:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
office and their co-pays are 40 50 and
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
even last week 75 dollar co-pays when
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
our maximum that we're allowed to charge
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
is usually somewhere between 27 and 39
 
01:21:57.169 --> 01:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
dollars for for spinal manipulation
 
01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
these patients are are forced to first
 
01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
of all the disillusion because they
 
01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
think they have coverage when they show
 
01:22:06.649 --> 01:22:06.659 align:start position:0%
up to our offices and then we we break
 
01:22:08.689 --> 01:22:08.699 align:start position:0%
the news to them many of them return to
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
the primary care physicians go to back
 
01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
to the pharmaceutical management because
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
they do not actually have Chiropractic
 
01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
coverage it's a phantom benefit it
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be allowed to happen it's
 
01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.209 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be allowed to happen it's
deceitful

01:22:23.209 --> 01:22:23.219 align:start position:0%
deceitful
 
01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
and it has been going on for years
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
so representative Weber relative to the
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
amendment uh the intent of that
 
01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
amendment was to to clarify that there
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
was a section in there that made
 
01:22:39.649 --> 01:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
reference to referred by a health care
 
01:22:41.630 --> 01:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
practitioner sometimes the insurance
 
01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
industry interprets that as being a
 
01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
referral by a medical practitioner we
 
01:22:48.970 --> 01:22:48.980 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that doesn't happen
 
01:22:52.669 --> 01:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy relative to that
 
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
two elements of of this I think you're
 
01:22:59.229 --> 01:22:59.239 align:start position:0%
actually asking about the two uh
 
01:23:02.209 --> 01:23:02.219 align:start position:0%
relative to um
 
01:23:04.729 --> 01:23:04.739 align:start position:0%
uh the conversation it's about the
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
conversation taking place the directive
 
01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
between the The Physician and the
 
01:23:12.649 --> 01:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
patient and this can be in whatever form
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
you want it to be yeah this I think that
 
01:23:17.209 --> 01:23:17.219 align:start position:0%
that's the bill kind of says that Mr
 
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you thank you doctor
 
01:23:23.570 --> 01:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
uh questions for Dr stagnone
 
01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative McLean
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um I'm pretty
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
clear on the alternative treatments I'm
 
01:23:34.729 --> 01:23:34.739 align:start position:0%
pretty clear on the
 
01:23:36.890 --> 01:23:36.900 align:start position:0%
um Insurance elements
 
01:23:38.689 --> 01:23:38.699 align:start position:0%
um on the directive side of this thing
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
you're starting to fill in some of the
 
01:23:42.649 --> 01:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
pieces for me is it the intention of
 
01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
this bill then that uh the
 
01:23:49.729 --> 01:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
the form is voluntary but that the
 
01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
communication of the form would be
 
01:23:53.930 --> 01:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
mandatory and so that's what's driving
 
01:23:56.090 --> 01:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
the conversation is that the intention
 
01:23:58.430 --> 01:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
of the bill I I think so I think it's
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's not our intent
 
01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:03.110 align:start position:0%
it's not our intent
to

01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
tell the medical practitioner how to run
 
01:24:07.729 --> 01:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
his or her business
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
but one of the clear components of this
 
01:24:13.370 --> 01:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
problem as we have sat down with the
 
01:24:15.290 --> 01:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
governor's people and you read these
 
01:24:17.570 --> 01:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
articles on this stuff is that the
 
01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
patients as a whole are not aware that
 
01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
some of these Alternatives exist and
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
they look to their physician for
 
01:24:27.290 --> 01:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
guidance on these things and if they're
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
not being introduced to these other
 
01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
avenues of care particularly early in
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
care very important
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
the Dartmouth study demonstrated a 55
 
01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
reduction in opioid prescription writing
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
when the patient was introduced to
 
01:24:48.770 --> 01:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic Care at an early point this
 
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
was based upon over thirteen thousand
 
01:24:53.169 --> 01:24:53.179 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:24:56.630 --> 01:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
policyholders they redid the study in
 
01:24:58.970 --> 01:24:58.980 align:start position:0%
2020 and included Connecticut and
 
01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
they're still over 50 percent reduction
 
01:25:04.209 --> 01:25:04.219 align:start position:0%
in opioid prescription when these
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
alternatives are introduced early in the
 
01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
patients care and the directive is just
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
is a mechanism and we're not saying
 
01:25:15.169 --> 01:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
specifically what that has to be but we
 
01:25:18.110 --> 01:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
need to have some influence that these
 
01:25:21.169 --> 01:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
conversations are taking place
 
01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
how's that okay yes representative
 
01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.370 align:start position:0%
how's that okay yes representative
Shapiro

01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
Shapiro
 
01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
taking this question
 
01:25:35.570 --> 01:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
in reference to your comments about high
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
deductibles and I think you called it
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
Phantom coverage which is interesting
 
01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.649 align:start position:0%
Phantom coverage which is interesting

um

01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
is there something specific about
 
01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.570 align:start position:0%
is there something specific about
Chiropractic

01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic
 
01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:49.010 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic
um coverage

01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
um coverage
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
or is that kind of across the board for
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
many many medical services and would
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
this not Bill not really affect that not
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
to say that it's not an issue or a
 
01:25:59.570 --> 01:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
problem but
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
I think what this bill does is and it
 
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
uses the ACA act to try to ensure that
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
there's consistency in a Level Playing
 
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
Field there that has not existed for us
 
01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
in the Chiropractic profession there are
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
many instances and this is usually the
 
01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
point in my testimony in years previous
 
01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
where someone on the committee takes out
 
01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
their own insurance card and they're
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
looking at it and they say well my
 
01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
chiropractic co-pays thirty dollars and
 
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
that's not coincidental because the the
 
01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
better policies
 
01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
have the the copay that's the same as
 
01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:35.639 align:start position:0%
the primary care physician but the
 
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
majority of the policies we see in our
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
offices have these what they call
 
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
specialist co-pays they they rate us as
 
01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
Specialists but where from what I told
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
you earlier we're not being paid like
 
01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
Specialists okay but we are in we're a
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
lot we're categorized with the
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
neurologists we're categorized with the
 
01:26:58.250 --> 01:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
medical specialists who who's probably
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
getting three or four hundred dollars
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
for for a specialist visit that does not
 
01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
pertain to us and that's the that's the
 
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
Dilemma that our patients have are
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
facing when they come into our offices
 
01:27:11.209 --> 01:27:11.219 align:start position:0%
of the the look and we have to break the
 
01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
news to them and some of them just they
 
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
say sorry I can't do this and that's and
 
01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
that's the shame of this and it's been
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
what has allowed to perpetuate this over
 
01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
such a long period of time in this state
 
01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
when other states have actually taken
 
01:27:29.629 --> 01:27:29.639 align:start position:0%
steps to it right address it thank you
 
01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
another question representative Nagel
 
01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question and this is an
 
01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:36.540 align:start position:0%
important issue
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
um and I I the bill as you know is a lot
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
broader than Chiropractic and I really
 
01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
appreciate your your um involvement in
 
01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:44.090 align:start position:0%
appreciate your your um involvement in
this

01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
um I've been practicing the state for 33
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
years and I know we're going to hear
 
01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
testimony from the insurance companies
 
01:27:53.689 --> 01:27:53.699 align:start position:0%
aft shortly but my observation it's all
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
about access to care and my observation
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
is that when I started here there was
 
01:28:00.169 --> 01:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
substantially greater access to
 
01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
chiropractic care than there is now
 
01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
I'm curious if that's your observation
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely I've been in practice for 36
 
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
years when I started in practice the
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
typical patient would come in with the
 
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
80 20 policy there were there was there
 
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
was no there was no shell game as to
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
what your benefits were going to be you
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh you paid 20 percent the insurance
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
company colored 20 covered 80 percent
 
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
and what evolved over time was this you
 
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
know this whole specialist co-pay where
 
01:28:33.169 --> 01:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
they they decided that they could move
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
certain professions into different
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
categories and and in doing so for the
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic profession and and even
 
01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
they did they did some of this with the
 
01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
physical therapists as well where they
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
could then enhance uh the the patient
 
01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
responsibility and what they did
 
01:28:51.890 --> 01:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
basically was they enhanced it to the
 
01:28:53.209 --> 01:28:53.219 align:start position:0%
point where the patient's fully
 
01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:55.139 align:start position:0%
responsible for all their Chiropractic
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
benefits and that the better policies
 
01:29:02.090 --> 01:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
still have the the co-pays same as the
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
primary care physician and we feel that
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's a fair you know that's a fair
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
environment in which the practice but
 
01:29:12.110 --> 01:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
more and more of these companies using
 
01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
this strategy to enhance their profits
 
01:29:22.729 --> 01:29:22.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
saying no other questions
 
01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you Mr
 
01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:31.610 align:start position:0%

01:29:34.189 --> 01:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak this morning is

Laura alazam from Londonderry also
 
01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:39.410 align:start position:0%
Laura alazam from Londonderry also
welcome

01:29:39.410 --> 01:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:29:41.090 --> 01:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
I always like to see Londonderry people
 
01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
everybody thank you for having me here
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
today I'm not a doctor or medical
 
01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
professional I'm just a patient and I'm
 
01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
going to read so I can go fast and not
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
take up any more of your time than I
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:29:58.129 --> 01:29:58.139 align:start position:0%
um as a result of an accident over a
 
01:29:59.870 --> 01:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
decade ago I developed chronic pain in
 
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
my back and neck which I successfully
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
relieved with alternative therapy IT
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
addresses the pain and lack of Mobility
 
01:30:08.330 --> 01:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
directly but it also works on correcting
 
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
the underlying cause of my pain to
 
01:30:12.410 --> 01:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
forestall Future issues
 
01:30:14.090 --> 01:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
although painkillers were always an
 
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
option I have been and remain unwilling
 
01:30:18.169 --> 01:30:18.179 align:start position:0%
to start down this path my reluctance
 
01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
stems from watching my 23 year old
 
01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
daughter descend in a few short years
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
from a straight a high school student to
 
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
unemployable and homeless all because of
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
an addiction to opioids you've heard
 
01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
more than enough of these stories I
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
won't tell you any more about that but
 
01:30:36.169 --> 01:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
it's clear that we can't prohibit our
 
01:30:38.830 --> 01:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
way out of this societal nightmare
 
01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be another drug
 
01:30:43.729 --> 01:30:43.739 align:start position:0%
to fill the demand for a cheap high like
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
xylazine which is in the paper this
 
01:30:47.149 --> 01:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
morning it's an animal tranquilizer
 
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
that's causing a spike in overdose dose
 
01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
deaths locally
 
01:30:53.810 --> 01:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
it's apparently commercially available
 
01:30:58.490 --> 01:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:01.729 --> 01:31:01.739 align:start position:0%
instead of that we need to change the
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
expectations and habits of patience as
 
01:31:06.890 --> 01:31:06.900 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman alluded to
 
01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:07.850 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman alluded to
earlier

01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
by presenting proven reliable
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
alternative therapies as the preferred
 
01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
primary option to address pain
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
HB 554 presents an opportunity or an
 
01:31:22.129 --> 01:31:22.139 align:start position:0%
off-ramp from a road that too often
 
01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
leads to abuse and addiction it will
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
preserve Lives real lives that are parts
 
01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
of real families like mine
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
by affording patients a range of
 
01:31:34.729 --> 01:31:34.739 align:start position:0%
practical proven alternatives to opioids
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
for pain management I ask that you
 
01:31:40.490 --> 01:31:40.500 align:start position:0%

01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
um which you know often those sections
 
01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
or bills with those types of sections
 
01:32:51.709 --> 01:32:51.719 align:start position:0%
have gone to the house Commerce
 
01:32:51.719 --> 01:32:53.209 align:start position:0%
have gone to the house Commerce
Committee

01:32:53.209 --> 01:32:53.219 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
01:32:53.219 --> 01:32:54.709 align:start position:0%
Committee
um

01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
so I was I was happy to hear a comment
 
01:32:59.209 --> 01:32:59.219 align:start position:0%
earlier by the Vice chair that that
 
01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
maybe those should be
 
01:33:03.169 --> 01:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
um kind of set aside from the bill
 
01:33:05.209 --> 01:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
um I did want to say that um health
 
01:33:08.209 --> 01:33:08.219 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers do provide we do
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
support alternative treatment options
 
01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
um both alternative medication options
 
01:33:16.750 --> 01:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
as well as alternative
 
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
non-medicaid options or pharmaceutical
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh pharmacological options
 
01:33:26.050 --> 01:33:26.060 align:start position:0%
um and we do in fact cover
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic Care physical therapy
 
01:33:32.290 --> 01:33:32.300 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy tens units
 
01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
are all covered under standard plans
 
01:33:39.229 --> 01:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
there's coverage for acupuncture and gym
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
membership which could include yoga and
 
01:33:44.770 --> 01:33:44.780 align:start position:0%
other forms of exercise vary by plan
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
and massage is covered if it's part of a
 
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:51.560 align:start position:0%
Cairo PT or OT Services
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
carriers do offer different plans with
 
01:33:56.810 --> 01:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
different different covered benefits
 
01:33:59.450 --> 01:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
which do result in different premiums
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
and that's so that members can choose
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
the plan that best meets their needs and
 
01:34:05.689 --> 01:34:05.699 align:start position:0%
their budget
 
01:34:05.699 --> 01:34:06.350 align:start position:0%
their budget
um

01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
we have been working very closely on
 
01:34:11.570 --> 01:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
these issues with a variety of parties
 
01:34:14.450 --> 01:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
over the years and you've heard this
 
01:34:16.189 --> 01:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
morning that they're just this year
 
01:34:18.770 --> 01:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
alone there are two other bills that are
 
01:34:21.010 --> 01:34:21.020 align:start position:0%
have similar topic
 
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
or subject matter one is House Bill 303
 
01:34:27.050 --> 01:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
on the prime sponsor is representative
 
01:34:29.090 --> 01:34:29.100 align:start position:0%
Nagel his is relative to insurance
 
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
coverage for Pain Management Services
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
that was sent to the house Commerce
 
01:34:37.010 --> 01:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
Committee and there is a lot of
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
similarities starting with section two
 
01:34:43.689 --> 01:34:43.699 align:start position:0%
on in this bill with House Bill 303
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday representative Nagel requested
 
01:34:49.370 --> 01:34:49.380 align:start position:0%
that the committee retain that bill and
 
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
as you'll hear at your next hearing on
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 66 which is establishing us
 
01:34:56.810 --> 01:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
currently establishing a study
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
commission but I think it will be
 
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
changed to a study committee to try to
 
01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
look more closely at all of the issues
 
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
that are kind of wrapped into House Bill
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
303 and we are we've had conversations
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
with representative Nagel and
 
01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and we're
 
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
um in total agreement to participate in
 
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
those uh that steady committee efforts
 
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
and try to
 
01:35:22.729 --> 01:35:22.739 align:start position:0%
um make some progress I think in terms
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
of what people are looking for in terms
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
of integrated care around a variety of
 
01:35:28.679 --> 01:35:29.530 align:start position:0%
of integrated care around a variety of
services

01:35:29.530 --> 01:35:29.540 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
that could be offered to patients we do
 
01:35:36.169 --> 01:35:36.179 align:start position:0%
want them to have options and all access
 
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
to Alternatives we don't want to see
 
01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:39.669 align:start position:0%
to Alternatives we don't want to see
people

01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
getting addicted to opioids we
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
understand the costs that are associated
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
with that you can start wrapping up
 
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
um the only other thing I think I was
 
01:35:52.370 --> 01:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
going to mention
 
01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
um is just a reminder for people I think
 
01:35:56.090 --> 01:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
former representative might have
 
01:35:57.410 --> 01:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned this
 
01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
um any of these mandates that do get
 
01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
passed only will apply to about 25
 
01:36:05.209 --> 01:36:05.219 align:start position:0%
percent of the insurance Marketplace
 
01:36:08.689 --> 01:36:08.699 align:start position:0%
um namely the in individual and employer
 
01:36:13.729 --> 01:36:13.739 align:start position:0%
sponsored fully insured products so a
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
mandate such as you see in House Bill
 
01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
554 would not apply to Medicaid Medicare
 
01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's not going to apply to self-funded
 
01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
employer coverage which is becoming a
 
01:36:26.810 --> 01:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
bigger and bigger share of the
 
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
marketplace so government entities as
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
well as large and even now medium-sized
 
01:36:35.209 --> 01:36:35.219 align:start position:0%
employers are offering self-funded plans
 
01:36:35.219 --> 01:36:36.830 align:start position:0%
employers are offering self-funded plans
um

01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
military coverage of course uninsured so
 
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
I just want to make people aware that
 
01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
this does Target a relatively narrow
 
01:36:47.810 --> 01:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
sliver of the insurance Market
 
01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:48.770 align:start position:0%
sliver of the insurance Market
um

01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
and I'll I think I'll stop there I know
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
I've hit time and I'll happy to answer
 
01:36:53.689 --> 01:36:53.699 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you
 
01:36:58.370 --> 01:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
yes representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
um I always learned something new every
 
01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
time you talk so I really appreciate
 
01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:05.990 align:start position:0%
time you talk so I really appreciate
that

01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:07.860 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious and I should know the
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
answer to this but I don't
 
01:37:11.689 --> 01:37:11.699 align:start position:0%
um is workers compensation would they be
 
01:37:14.209 --> 01:37:14.219 align:start position:0%
included in in this I don't believe so
 
01:37:16.010 --> 01:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
no thank you
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative McLean thank you Mr
 
01:37:23.209 --> 01:37:23.219 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
question so
 
01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
um you say you already cover a lot of
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
this already so what what's what's new
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
in this from you say it's a narrow brand
 
01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
just 25 but for that 25 what does it add
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
relative to what's already covered
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
right um well I was you know as an
 
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.010 align:start position:0%
right um well I was you know as an
example

01:37:43.010 --> 01:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
um we do we do have concerns I know yoga
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
therapy was um discussed earlier
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
um there's reference
 
01:37:52.129 --> 01:37:52.139 align:start position:0%
um in here to
 
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
um Tai Chi and trying to find where
 
01:37:56.689 --> 01:37:56.699 align:start position:0%
where it is but some other
 
01:37:58.490 --> 01:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
um kind of like what I'll call exercise
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
programs like that and so
 
01:38:02.570 --> 01:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
um that's an example of where um
 
01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
insurance is really meant uh for medical
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
providers that that are licensed and
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
credentialed so that's an example of a
 
01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.330 align:start position:0%
credentialed so that's an example of a
concern

01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
um there's also language in here about
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
um uh treatments uh including but not
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
limited to
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
um and then there's a you know laundry
 
01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
list of of coverage so uh part of our
 
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
question is well what else besides
 
01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
what's listed here what's in the
 
01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
including two
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
um and there's reference to 20 visits
 
01:38:36.239 --> 01:38:37.189 align:start position:0%
um and there's reference to 20 visits
um

01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
per event and so I think when you start
 
01:38:44.330 --> 01:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
doing 20 visits and it's per covered
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
service and then you have an unknown
 
01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
number of services so it's things like
 
01:38:51.110 --> 01:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
that that are um just concern Us in
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
terms of not quite sure what in fact we
 
01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:55.860 align:start position:0%
would be asked under this to cover
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
beyond what I mentioned um that we are
 
01:38:59.570 --> 01:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
covering already follow-up
 
01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative so you're so your primary
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
concern aside from the licensure issue
 
01:39:07.010 --> 01:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
is just that there you feel that it's
 
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
being overly specific and it's taking
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
away flexibility that the primary
 
01:39:13.250 --> 01:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
concern you're saying then well I think
 
01:39:16.129 --> 01:39:16.139 align:start position:0%
it's overly broad with language like
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to
 
01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
01:39:25.810 --> 01:39:25.820 align:start position:0%
my question my question is about
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
evidence-based now at the beginning the
 
01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor talked about
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
evidence-based treatments
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious about what criteria your
 
01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
group uses to decide what when the
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
evidence base is it reaches the level
 
01:39:43.490 --> 01:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
where it should be covered by insurance
 
01:39:47.050 --> 01:39:47.060 align:start position:0%
is it some degree of what Medicare
 
01:39:49.310 --> 01:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
accepts or or is there a specific
 
01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.050 align:start position:0%
accepts or or is there a specific
process

01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
um so first of all I'll say that each
 
01:39:56.450 --> 01:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
each health insurance carrier has a
 
01:40:00.050 --> 01:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
panel of an independent panel of medical
 
01:40:04.370 --> 01:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
experts that are continuously looking at
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
um all forms of coverage not just
 
01:40:10.129 --> 01:40:10.139 align:start position:0%
specific to this and so that's
 
01:40:11.689 --> 01:40:11.699 align:start position:0%
um they're always you know looking at
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
new evidence that's coming along new
 
01:40:16.370 --> 01:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
treatments new medications whatever the
 
01:40:18.050 --> 01:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
case may be
 
01:40:21.169 --> 01:40:21.179 align:start position:0%
um and looking at the consensus around
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
that and kind of you know um
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
what a coverage would be appropriate
 
01:40:29.570 --> 01:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
Medicare is certainly a benchmark
 
01:40:31.729 --> 01:40:31.739 align:start position:0%
standard that's looked to by commercial
 
01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
coverage so I think it's it's a
 
01:40:36.410 --> 01:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
um but you're right in both of those
 
01:40:37.850 --> 01:40:37.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:41.209 --> 01:40:41.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you
 
01:40:45.770 --> 01:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
and the final press I'm aware of who has
 
01:40:51.530 --> 01:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
signed up for Testimony this morning on
 
01:40:56.169 --> 01:40:56.179 align:start position:0%
HB 554 is Sabrina Dunn Dunlap
 
01:40:58.430 --> 01:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Sabrina Dunlap director of
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
government relations for Anthem and
 
01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
um I won't repeat what Heidi said I just
 
01:41:09.290 --> 01:41:09.300 align:start position:0%
wanted to touch on a few key points if
 
01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
you could stay within three minutes
 
01:41:12.110 --> 01:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
that'd be great oh yes yeah
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
um just really quickly so we were part
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
of a group that came together last
 
01:41:18.410 --> 01:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
summer I think it was HB 247 a very
 
01:41:20.810 --> 01:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
similar bill and
 
01:41:22.669 --> 01:41:22.679 align:start position:0%
um we are very interested in continuing
 
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
those conversations we've talked to
 
01:41:25.970 --> 01:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
representative Nigel and Merchant and
 
01:41:28.370 --> 01:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
others about the study commission or
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
committee that could come out of this
 
01:41:31.370 --> 01:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
and I think that is very useful because
 
01:41:33.850 --> 01:41:33.860 align:start position:0%
what we ran into is we do cover
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic acupuncture
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
um a bunch of the services listed in
 
01:41:40.129 --> 01:41:40.139 align:start position:0%
here but one of the issues we ran into
 
01:41:42.410 --> 01:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
last summer we discovered is I think
 
01:41:43.970 --> 01:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
there's an issue around provider
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
education in terms of recommending these
 
01:41:48.890 --> 01:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
alternative treatments
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
um and so I don't think this bill solves
 
01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
that problem
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
so and Heidi touched on when you get
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
into other services like yoga Tai Chi
 
01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
they're not licensed by the state uh
 
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
they're not regulated so it becomes a
 
01:42:03.770 --> 01:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
practical problem in terms of trying to
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
cover those services and
 
01:42:09.530 --> 01:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
one other issue I just wanted to mention
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
Mr signo brought up this issue of
 
01:42:11.639 --> 01:42:13.609 align:start position:0%
Mr signo brought up this issue of
co-pays

01:42:13.609 --> 01:42:13.619 align:start position:0%
co-pays
 
01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
um and you really get into benefit
 
01:42:17.930 --> 01:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
design which gets complicated especially
 
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.639 align:start position:0%
when so many people have coverage under
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
employer-sponsored erisa plans which
 
01:42:25.930 --> 01:42:25.940 align:start position:0%
Again State mandates don't touch those
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
and a lot of benefit design issues are
 
01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
determined by the employers who who have
 
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
those plans
 
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:33.890 align:start position:0%
those plans
um

01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:36.050 --> 01:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
so anyway I think I hit all the points
 
01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the opportunity to
 
01:42:39.169 --> 01:42:39.179 align:start position:0%
speak today happy to take questions
 
01:42:42.350 --> 01:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative Nagel I
 
01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
mean um representative Shapiro I'm sorry
 
01:42:46.850 --> 01:42:46.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you could comment about
 
01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:51.050 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you could comment about
um

01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:53.810 --> 01:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
we heard from a previous person who
 
01:42:56.510 --> 01:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
testified about coverage for a
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis and if you could
 
01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
comment about the advisability or
 
01:43:05.330 --> 01:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
practicability practical practicality of
 
01:43:08.689 --> 01:43:08.699 align:start position:0%
insurance companies actually doing that
 
01:43:10.490 --> 01:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
that is a good question and I was
 
01:43:11.689 --> 01:43:11.699 align:start position:0%
thinking earlier when it came up I
 
01:43:13.310 --> 01:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
actually don't know the answer I'm happy
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
to get back to you my initial response
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
is I do think it gets complicated
 
01:43:17.930 --> 01:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:43:20.450 --> 01:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
the way cannabis is treated by state and
 
01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
federal government I think there are
 
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
01:43:31.490 --> 01:43:31.500 align:start position:0%

that was here yesterday I'd like to take
 
01:44:19.729 --> 01:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
a moment to apologize to the committee
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
to the general public and to an
 
01:44:24.169 --> 01:44:24.179 align:start position:0%
individual named Eric Liu who was uh
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
testifying yesterday during executive
 
01:44:29.570 --> 01:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
session I uh referred to his title in a
 
01:44:31.609 --> 01:44:31.619 align:start position:0%
derogatory way which was beneath my
 
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
office and I felt shamed the moment I
 
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
said it and I felt embarrassed the last
 
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
24 hours so
 
01:44:40.250 --> 01:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
um I I'd like to extend that apology and
 
01:44:41.930 --> 01:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
um with the Lord's help I'll never make
 
01:44:43.729 --> 01:44:43.739 align:start position:0%
that mistake again so thank you again

and as you heard earlier today through
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
testimonial previous bill
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
this is a complex issue
 
01:46:27.239 --> 01:46:28.729 align:start position:0%
this is a complex issue
and

01:46:28.729 --> 01:46:28.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:31.129 --> 01:46:31.139 align:start position:0%
haven't worked through this on House
 
01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
Bill 247 actually worked with
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
01:46:37.250 --> 01:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
Dr Nagel at a time and also
 
01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative Koval to try to find ways
 
01:46:42.290 --> 01:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
to and also with the insurance industry
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
trying to find ways to try to take the
 
01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
complexity and make it more simplistic
 
01:46:48.770 --> 01:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
what we learned along the journey with a
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary group of people
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
which is comprised of Physicians nurse
 
01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:54.970 align:start position:0%
which is comprised of Physicians nurse
practitioners

01:46:54.970 --> 01:46:54.980 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists natural paths patients
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
the insurance industry is how complex
 
01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
this issue really is
 
01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:04.250 align:start position:0%
this issue really is
so

01:47:04.250 --> 01:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
in saying that what we all agree to it
 
01:47:09.770 --> 01:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
should be a patient-centered
 
01:47:12.169 --> 01:47:12.179 align:start position:0%
multi approach
 
01:47:14.810 --> 01:47:14.820 align:start position:0%
and right now we don't have that and
 
01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:16.139 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure out how to get
 
01:47:18.050 --> 01:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
the patient back in the middle and let
 
01:47:20.090 --> 01:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
the patient Drive the Bus pain is
 
01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
fundamentally very subjective
 
01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's really determined by the patient
 
01:47:27.229 --> 01:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
and therefore we have to have multiple
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
ways to work for the patient and let
 
01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
them Drive the Bus
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 303 which representative
 
01:47:36.890 --> 01:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
Nagel put in that corresponded with him
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
went to Commerce and yesterday you heard
 
01:47:41.209 --> 01:47:41.219 align:start position:0%
that when you have a commission
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes it becomes problematic to have
 
01:47:44.090 --> 01:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
it staffed it's a lot easier to work
 
01:47:45.530 --> 01:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
with the committee than a commission so
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
I have an amendment to
 
01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:52.850 --> 01:47:52.860 align:start position:0%
to the committee itself
 
01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
what I want to say at this point in time
 
01:47:55.020 --> 01:47:56.629 align:start position:0%
what I want to say at this point in time
is

01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:47:59.290 --> 01:47:59.300 align:start position:0%
the intent also with what representative
 
01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
Lundgren was also part of that work
 
01:48:04.189 --> 01:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
group is I think there's a lot of
 
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
sincere interests by multiple parties to
 
01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
try to find a way to come up with a
 
01:48:12.169 --> 01:48:12.179 align:start position:0%
solution or at least solutions to how we
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
can help patients deal with chronic pain
 
01:48:17.689 --> 01:48:17.699 align:start position:0%
or acute pain and historically
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
have worked in the world of Pharmacy
 
01:48:21.649 --> 01:48:21.659 align:start position:0%
a lot of it was done through opiates
 
01:48:23.629 --> 01:48:23.639 align:start position:0%
which had its own unintended
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
consequences we're dealing with today
 
01:48:28.250 --> 01:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
so the intent of this bill is to really
 
01:48:30.890 --> 01:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
pull the stakeholders together through a
 
01:48:32.990 --> 01:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
study committee and say what are the
 
01:48:36.169 --> 01:48:36.179 align:start position:0%
barriers what are the complex issues are
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
the solutions that we could work with
 
01:48:40.129 --> 01:48:40.139 align:start position:0%
there's no easy answer
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
but I think if we can put us all in the
 
01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:44.820 align:start position:0%
same room and talk about this including
 
01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
the patients
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
we have at least a shot at trying to
 
01:48:50.450 --> 01:48:50.460 align:start position:0%
figure out how to unravel the knot
 
01:48:52.250 --> 01:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
and saying that I want to turn over to
 
01:48:53.689 --> 01:48:53.699 align:start position:0%
Dr Nagel representative Nagel because
 
01:48:55.609 --> 01:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
he's done a lot of work as well and I
 
01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:57.719 align:start position:0%
wanted him to take some of my time as
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
the chairman if that's at all possible
 
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
sure perhaps he's supposed to wipe down
 
01:49:07.010 --> 01:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Merchant thank
 
01:49:11.209 --> 01:49:11.219 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you everybody
 
01:49:11.219 --> 01:49:11.930 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you everybody
um

01:49:11.930 --> 01:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
he already did the third part of what I
 
01:49:16.129 --> 01:49:16.139 align:start position:0%
wanted to do I wanted to tell you who I
 
01:49:18.169 --> 01:49:18.179 align:start position:0%
am and why this is important
 
01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:19.980 align:start position:0%
um you kind of heard some of it you kind
 
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
of missed a lot of it in earlier
 
01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:22.750 align:start position:0%
of missed a lot of it in earlier
testimony

01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:49:25.490 --> 01:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry Gary we're
 
01:49:26.570 --> 01:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
buddies now
 
01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:29.639 align:start position:0%
um he he explained why a commissions or
 
01:49:32.090 --> 01:49:32.100 align:start position:0%
committee is important um this has been
 
01:49:34.669 --> 01:49:34.679 align:start position:0%
a 33-year journey for me
 
01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
um my practice is I'm a doc my practice
 
01:49:39.290 --> 01:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
is I work with people with complex
 
01:49:42.109 --> 01:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities very early on in my career
 
01:49:43.970 --> 01:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
I came to the understanding that pain is
 
01:49:46.370 --> 01:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
a part of that and in almost everybody
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
and what I was struck with was what a
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
poor job we did of handling that
 
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
managing that and
 
01:49:56.209 --> 01:49:56.219 align:start position:0%
um and I I just at that time in my life
 
01:49:58.490 --> 01:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
I realized this is a vacuum this is a
 
01:50:00.050 --> 01:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
hole something needs to be done so I
 
01:50:03.649 --> 01:50:03.659 align:start position:0%
began a 33-year career in advocacy
 
01:50:05.689 --> 01:50:05.699 align:start position:0%
um and I'm I don't want to go over this
 
01:50:08.570 --> 01:50:08.580 align:start position:0%
testimony in any great detail this is a
 
01:50:10.970 --> 01:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
partial list of what I've done but I
 
01:50:12.350 --> 01:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
started advocating for the right rates
 
01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
of people and pain
 
01:50:17.090 --> 01:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell I represent 66 million
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
Americans who suffer from chronic pain I
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
I represent 1.5 million Americans are in
 
01:50:25.310 --> 01:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
hospice or palliative care at any moment
 
01:50:27.590 --> 01:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
I represent all the people the 50
 
01:50:29.689 --> 01:50:29.699 align:start position:0%
million people that's kind of doubles
 
01:50:31.129 --> 01:50:31.139 align:start position:0%
but any 50 million that are going to get
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
surgery they're going to get
 
01:50:34.729 --> 01:50:34.739 align:start position:0%
perioperative post-operative care and I
 
01:50:36.770 --> 01:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
represent the untoward numbers of people
 
01:50:39.530 --> 01:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
that are going to suffer severe moderate
 
01:50:42.050 --> 01:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
to severe pain after acute injury all
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
their stories are really important we
 
01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:45.719 align:start position:0%
heard some earlier today but there's a
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
lot more than that as part of that I
 
01:50:49.729 --> 01:50:49.739 align:start position:0%
initiate and I wrote all the state
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
policies on opioid prescribing
 
01:50:55.490 --> 01:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
I wrote this book that deals with
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
everything we're going to be talking
 
01:50:58.910 --> 01:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
about this morning and that proud to say
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
that was sold on four continents so it I
 
01:51:02.590 --> 01:51:02.600 align:start position:0%
think it has value
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
I also chaired the NFL players
 
01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:06.890 align:start position:0%
I also chaired the NFL players
associations

01:51:06.890 --> 01:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
associations
 
01:51:08.750 --> 01:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
um pain management best practices
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
committee for the last seven years and
 
01:51:13.370 --> 01:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
I'm the lead author of our guide to
 
01:51:15.169 --> 01:51:15.179 align:start position:0%
managing pain and performance in
 
01:51:16.750 --> 01:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
athletes but
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
everything that we did is about what
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking about today so what we're
 
01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
talking about the model exists
 
01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
we've learned a lot about the opioid
 
01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
crisis today and we've learned nothing
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
it's been said a lot everybody wants to
 
01:51:33.709 --> 01:51:33.719 align:start position:0%
blame somebody for it I blame I mean
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
we're happy to talk in detail about that
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
with anybody because I've been involved
 
01:51:39.530 --> 01:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
with it since day one but I think what
 
01:51:41.689 --> 01:51:41.699 align:start position:0%
we need to get away from is Magic Bullet
 
01:51:44.510 --> 01:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
thinking we always think that this drug
 
01:51:46.669 --> 01:51:46.679 align:start position:0%
or that surgery or this Chiropractic
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
career that our yoga treatment is going
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
to cure everything and we know that
 
01:51:52.010 --> 01:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
that's not true it may be for
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
individuals but not as a group we need
 
01:51:56.090 --> 01:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
to get away from that thinking and that
 
01:51:58.250 --> 01:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
concerns me also about cannabis that
 
01:51:59.810 --> 01:51:59.820 align:start position:0%
we're going to get into that same Magic
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
Bullet thinking we've sewn in Western
 
01:52:05.649 --> 01:52:05.659 align:start position:0%
literature since the 1980s that
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
patient-centered comprehensive
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
integrative multimodality care is What
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
patients need in eastern and thought
 
01:52:15.169 --> 01:52:15.179 align:start position:0%
we've known that for over 2 000 years if
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
you go to an Eastern practitioner
 
01:52:18.410 --> 01:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
they're not just going to stick a needle
 
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
in you or give you an herb or tell you
 
01:52:22.609 --> 01:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
to take up Karate or something they're
 
01:52:23.930 --> 01:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
going to give you all of that and
 
01:52:25.729 --> 01:52:25.739 align:start position:0%
they've been doing that for 2 000 years
 
01:52:28.370 --> 01:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
successfully and we have not and that's
 
01:52:29.810 --> 01:52:29.820 align:start position:0%
a problem and I'm not gonna I'll leave
 
01:52:31.550 --> 01:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
it up to your imaginations as to why
 
01:52:32.689 --> 01:52:32.699 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
this cost is over 650 million dollars
 
01:52:38.330 --> 01:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
per year by not addressing these issues
 
01:52:39.770 --> 01:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
and according to the Institute of
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
medicine so it's a big Financial issue I
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
know money is really important here
 
01:52:47.810 --> 01:52:47.820 align:start position:0%
um anyways with that said these are
 
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
guides that we're going to go over Page
 
01:52:53.209 --> 01:52:53.219 align:start position:0%
by page right now if you don't mind I
 
01:52:55.129 --> 01:52:55.139 align:start position:0%
was actually involved in the authorship
 
01:52:57.770 --> 01:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
of both of these as the CDC guide to
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
opioid prescribing this is the latest
 
01:53:01.850 --> 01:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
version that came out about three months
 
01:53:05.209 --> 01:53:05.219 align:start position:0%
ago and the interagency task for some
 
01:53:06.649 --> 01:53:06.659 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
created this there's actually a quote in
 
01:53:13.729 --> 01:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
my um my testimony from the CDC guide
 
01:53:15.290 --> 01:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
that I think you should read and I'm not
 
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
going to bore you by reading it now
 
01:53:19.729 --> 01:53:19.739 align:start position:0%
basically what we have now
 
01:53:22.189 --> 01:53:22.199 align:start position:0%
um really I want to just talk about
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
crazies for a second then I'll wrap up
 
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
um we talk about an opioid crisis I will
 
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
tell you we have a crisis of over
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
prescription we simultaneously have a
 
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
person prices of under prescription we
 
01:53:37.370 --> 01:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
have an epidemic of costly
 
01:53:40.189 --> 01:53:40.199 align:start position:0%
poorly evidence-based procedures that we
 
01:53:42.649 --> 01:53:42.659 align:start position:0%
pay for and we can talk about
 
01:53:44.330 --> 01:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
evidence-based somebody asked that
 
01:53:46.129 --> 01:53:46.139 align:start position:0%
question earlier you can ask me a
 
01:53:47.450 --> 01:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
question if you want
 
01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
um we have a crisis of a costly and
 
01:53:51.590 --> 01:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
efficient Health Care System we have a
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
crisis of dependency where we force
 
01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
people into dependency and my goal is to
 
01:53:58.669 --> 01:53:58.679 align:start position:0%
empower people with the tools they need
 
01:54:01.250 --> 01:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
to manage this difficult problem all
 
01:54:03.290 --> 01:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
this is fueled the Mental Health crisis
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
and my biggest concern is we have a
 
01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
crisis of patient abandonment and that
 
01:54:10.090 --> 01:54:10.100 align:start position:0%
really bothers me a lot I run a
 
01:54:13.010 --> 01:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
non-profit patient advocacy group or we
 
01:54:14.750 --> 01:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
deal with people that are dealing with
 
01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
the we call the opioid refugees the
 
01:54:18.649 --> 01:54:18.659 align:start position:0%
people that have been abandoned by this
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
system to basically go to the streets
 
01:54:22.970 --> 01:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
for their drugs or whatever because they
 
01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
can't get them from a Health Care system
 
01:54:27.410 --> 01:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem to care anymore
 
01:54:30.410 --> 01:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
um anyways there are three models on why
 
01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
this works the VA has put together a
 
01:54:34.490 --> 01:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
model that they show integrative
 
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
comprehensive management works and saves
 
01:54:38.689 --> 01:54:38.699 align:start position:0%
money the University of Vermont has a
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
pilot program that is now a real program
 
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
because they demonstrated all these cost
 
01:54:45.590 --> 01:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
savings already we want to figure out
 
01:54:48.250 --> 01:54:48.260 align:start position:0%
how to do the same and and Gary
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative Gary Merchant doctor
 
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative Gary Merchant and I um
 
01:54:55.129 --> 01:54:55.139 align:start position:0%
both believe that we think that by
 
01:54:58.129 --> 01:54:58.139 align:start position:0%
putting Minds in a room together we can
 
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
solve problems a lot better than just
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
throwing things out and unfortunately to
 
01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
date that's really what's happened
 
01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little sad that my bill got
 
01:55:08.209 --> 01:55:08.219 align:start position:0%
tied into
 
01:55:10.669 --> 01:55:10.679 align:start position:0%
um 247 only because they're really very
 
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
different concepts they should have been
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
kept separate I want to finish with a
 
01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:15.950 align:start position:0%
kept separate I want to finish with a
story

01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
story
 
01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:16.609 align:start position:0%
story
um

01:55:16.609 --> 01:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:19.129 --> 01:55:19.139 align:start position:0%
so we met with players on injured
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
reserve a couple months ago and um we
 
01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:24.060 align:start position:0%
already know how they feel about team
 
01:55:25.729 --> 01:55:25.739 align:start position:0%
doctors so
 
01:55:28.010 --> 01:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
um we asked the players they're all in
 
01:55:30.649 --> 01:55:30.659 align:start position:0%
their mid-20s um you know how did you do
 
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
you trust your team doctor and the
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
answer was an expletive that began with
 
01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
the letter F no and in a very loud
 
01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
language and and then that didn't
 
01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
surprise me I already knew the answer to
 
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
that but then one of them said I don't
 
01:55:47.149 --> 01:55:47.159 align:start position:0%
trust any doctor and I looked at him and
 
01:55:49.129 --> 01:55:49.139 align:start position:0%
I said what and he goes I don't trust
 
01:55:50.810 --> 01:55:50.820 align:start position:0%
any doctor he says they're they're
 
01:55:52.850 --> 01:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
basically more interested in what they
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
can do for me how much they can make
 
01:55:56.990 --> 01:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
money off of me how much they're
 
01:55:59.090 --> 01:55:59.100 align:start position:0%
dependent on a corporate structure that
 
01:56:01.310 --> 01:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
reimburses them and basically forces
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
them into an Interventional model an
 
01:56:06.290 --> 01:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
insurance company that reimburses all
 
01:56:08.330 --> 01:56:08.340 align:start position:0%
this and he was not talking about him as
 
01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
a professional athlete he was talking
 
01:56:12.410 --> 01:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
about his family and experiences that
 
01:56:15.590 --> 01:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
he'd had so then I asked him well we
 
01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
know that every NFL player has pain 100
 
01:56:19.729 --> 01:56:19.739 align:start position:0%
of the time so I go how do you manage
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
your pain he then proceeded to write
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
bill h303 for me I mean everything he
 
01:56:28.129 --> 01:56:28.139 align:start position:0%
said that he uses is an HB 303 and I
 
01:56:29.570 --> 01:56:29.580 align:start position:0%
looked at him I said you know you're
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
lucky and he says why is that he goes
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
you're an elite athlete you can get all
 
01:56:34.970 --> 01:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
that stuff guess what I work with
 
01:56:37.010 --> 01:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
retired players more than active players
 
01:56:39.050 --> 01:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
and I asked him guess what the minute
 
01:56:40.490 --> 01:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
you retire you're going to have access
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
to none of that and and he just looks at
 
01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
me and you know it was really a
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
difficult moment for all of us but um
 
01:56:50.450 --> 01:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
we've heard we need to make a big
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
difference not just for elite athletes
 
01:56:53.930 --> 01:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
but for people as a whole and I will
 
01:56:56.810 --> 01:56:56.820 align:start position:0%
answer any questions anybody has
 
01:57:00.890 --> 01:57:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:03.050 --> 01:57:03.060 align:start position:0%
thank you both for your testimony and
 
01:57:04.970 --> 01:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
and maybe you could stay because oh
 
01:57:07.490 --> 01:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
you're doing the amendment that was one
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
of my questions so I won't have to ask
 
01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up but
 
01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:14.089 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up but
um

01:57:14.089 --> 01:57:14.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:14.099 --> 01:57:17.089 align:start position:0%
um
my

01:57:17.089 --> 01:57:17.099 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:57:19.850 --> 01:57:19.860 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:57:22.250 --> 01:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
very much in the where do we go from
 
01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:23.270 align:start position:0%
very much in the where do we go from
here

01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:57:24.910 --> 01:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
uh line
 
01:57:28.490 --> 01:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that 303 has been
 
01:57:31.850 --> 01:57:31.860 align:start position:0%
retained and that's happened already we
 
01:57:35.629 --> 01:57:35.639 align:start position:0%
have before us here two bills uh one of
 
01:57:37.149 --> 01:57:37.159 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:57:40.669 --> 01:57:40.679 align:start position:0%
a study committee so
 
01:57:40.679 --> 01:57:41.810 align:start position:0%
a study committee so
um

01:57:41.810 --> 01:57:41.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:44.270 --> 01:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
or one of which
 
01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:45.410 align:start position:0%
or one of which
um

01:57:45.410 --> 01:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
has very good intentions behind it but
 
01:57:52.850 --> 01:57:52.860 align:start position:0%
huge drafting issues in it
 
01:57:55.970 --> 01:57:55.980 align:start position:0%
so I guess my my first question would be
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
are you recommending that we retain that
 
01:58:02.089 --> 01:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
one as well and pass the
 
01:58:02.099 --> 01:58:03.050 align:start position:0%
one as well and pass the
um

01:58:03.050 --> 01:58:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:06.350 --> 01:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
study Commission representative Weber
 
01:58:09.169 --> 01:58:09.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes it's my
 
01:58:10.430 --> 01:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation I think also with
 
01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
represent nego that we would retain that
 
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
bill here in this committee to
 
01:58:17.930 --> 01:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
ultimately look at 303 look at 554 and
 
01:58:20.570 --> 01:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
then through the study committee to look
 
01:58:22.490 --> 01:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
at and saying how can either emeld them
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
together or make them more workable so
 
01:58:26.450 --> 01:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
it takes care of a lot of the questions
 
01:58:28.669 --> 01:58:28.679 align:start position:0%
you're asking about and that is how it's
 
01:58:30.770 --> 01:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
extracted the language within it but
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
more importantly I think the critical
 
01:58:34.669 --> 01:58:34.679 align:start position:0%
part to it is getting the stakeholders
 
01:58:35.570 --> 01:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
in a room particularly insurance
 
01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
carriers buying into what we're saying
 
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
because if we don't have their support
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's probably not going to go
 
01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:42.649 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's probably not going to go
anywhere

01:58:42.649 --> 01:58:42.659 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
01:58:45.530 --> 01:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on that um the best
 
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
second best day of my life was when the
 
01:58:50.750 --> 01:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
insurance reps you know said that they
 
01:58:52.250 --> 01:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
wanted to do this obviously the first
 
01:58:53.930 --> 01:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
was when I got married but that was the
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
second best so I mean you know bringing
 
01:58:58.490 --> 01:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
people together is really important to
 
01:58:59.689 --> 01:58:59.699 align:start position:0%
solve a problem
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
um as far as I'm concerned um
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
the re what brought us together was the
 
01:59:07.070 --> 01:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
flaws of what was 247 and all those
 
01:59:10.010 --> 01:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
flaws are still in that I would love to
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
take credit for 303 I wrote that with
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
Cindy Steinberg from the U.S pain
 
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
foundation so it's based on National
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
thinking it's not based on local
 
01:59:20.810 --> 01:59:20.820 align:start position:0%
thinking I also wanted to point out that
 
01:59:22.669 --> 01:59:22.679 align:start position:0%
I forgot to earlier if you look in the
 
01:59:24.589 --> 01:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
list of organizations that support what
 
01:59:26.990 --> 01:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
we're doing the alliance to advance
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
comprehensive integrative pain
 
01:59:30.169 --> 01:59:30.179 align:start position:0%
management of which I'm a founding
 
01:59:32.570 --> 01:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
member um has been looking at this issue
 
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
for a while it represents 92
 
01:59:36.890 --> 01:59:36.900 align:start position:0%
organizations Nationwide including
 
01:59:39.410 --> 01:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
insurance companies so we're all trying
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
to work together to solve this problem
 
01:59:43.729 --> 01:59:43.739 align:start position:0%
there's flaws with 303 I'm not that
 
01:59:47.570 --> 01:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
brilliant there's flaws at 247. this is
 
01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
the way I think to fix those flaws
 
01:59:56.209 --> 01:59:56.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
and would you agree with me that as
 
02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
frustrating as it is after all this time
 
02:00:05.870 --> 02:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
and all these studies uh to have yet
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
another study and not a bill
 
02:00:14.330 --> 02:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
it's more important to get it done right
 
02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:15.770 align:start position:0%
it's more important to get it done right
yes

02:00:15.770 --> 02:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you can put that on the
 
02:00:20.510 --> 02:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
record but yeah thank you I think one of
 
02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
the things we've seen in the past
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
is we've done things sort of in
 
02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
different silos and I think we're
 
02:00:29.089 --> 02:00:29.099 align:start position:0%
pulling together the various silos the
 
02:00:30.589 --> 02:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
various members and stakeholders in each
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
Silo to talk about things across the
 
02:00:35.089 --> 02:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
silos to come up with something that's
 
02:00:37.850 --> 02:00:37.860 align:start position:0%
probably more workable and again back to
 
02:00:39.770 --> 02:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
the same thing is it really needs to be
 
02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
patient centered pain is subjective it's
 
02:00:45.050 --> 02:00:45.060 align:start position:0%
really up to the patient to determine
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
what's working for them versus someone
 
02:00:48.649 --> 02:00:48.659 align:start position:0%
trying to make an artificial guess at
 
02:00:51.530 --> 02:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
what does work so by keeping it patients
 
02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:53.149 align:start position:0%
what does work so by keeping it patients
centered

02:00:53.149 --> 02:00:53.159 align:start position:0%
centered
 
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
with all of us is important too that we
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
include patients in what we talk to and
 
02:00:59.330 --> 02:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
what are the things that they see as
 
02:01:01.729 --> 02:01:01.739 align:start position:0%
barriers that they run into that we need
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
to consider as the committee
 
02:01:07.070 --> 02:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber
 
02:01:09.229 --> 02:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
and I have one last question which is
 
02:01:12.290 --> 02:01:12.300 align:start position:0%
about the amendment which turns the
 
02:01:15.169 --> 02:01:15.179 align:start position:0%
commission into a committee
 
02:01:17.330 --> 02:01:17.340 align:start position:0%
um unlike the approach that we saw
 
02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
yesterday you have chosen not to
 
02:01:19.980 --> 02:01:21.470 align:start position:0%
yesterday you have chosen not to
enumerate

02:01:21.470 --> 02:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
enumerate
 
02:01:23.810 --> 02:01:23.820 align:start position:0%
the the people who are going to be
 
02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
consulted by the committee but are you
 
02:01:30.169 --> 02:01:30.179 align:start position:0%
convinced because I have seen committees
 
02:01:32.810 --> 02:01:32.820 align:start position:0%
like this work really well when there is
 
02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
buy-in from
 
02:01:36.410 --> 02:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
all of the stakeholders are used
 
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
sufficiently convinced that the
 
02:01:41.149 --> 02:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
stakeholders will buy into this process
 
02:01:43.609 --> 02:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
and work with you despite the fact of
 
02:01:45.410 --> 02:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
not being enumerated as committee
 
02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:46.729 align:start position:0%
not being enumerated as committee
members

02:01:46.729 --> 02:01:46.739 align:start position:0%
members
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
the reason I took it from a commission
 
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
to a committee I did not realize we sort
 
02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
of had a hybrid
 
02:01:54.050 --> 02:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
which came to my attention with
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson to list them yes
 
02:01:58.370 --> 02:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
I believe the
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
stakeholders we've talked to are
 
02:02:01.669 --> 02:02:01.679 align:start position:0%
definitely involved with being part of
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
the process if you think in your opinion
 
02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
we should list them within the bill I
 
02:02:09.470 --> 02:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
bill and one last follow-up and then I
 
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
promise I will stop that as well so
 
02:02:13.970 --> 02:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
we've been working on this issue for 30
 
02:02:17.089 --> 02:02:17.099 align:start position:0%
years we have a collaborative a lot of
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
the people of our Coalition aren't even
 
02:02:20.570 --> 02:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
here today because they testified on
 
02:02:20.580 --> 02:02:22.310 align:start position:0%
here today because they testified on
303.

02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
303.
 
02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
um but we have acupuncturists we have
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
psych we have nursing um
 
02:02:29.570 --> 02:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
um we have Chiropractic I don't consider
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
it I mean everybody and we've been part
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
of this discussion together for a long
 
02:02:36.530 --> 02:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
time I think this would formalize it um
 
02:02:38.109 --> 02:02:38.119 align:start position:0%
and thanks to
 
02:02:40.250 --> 02:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant for putting that
 
02:02:43.250 --> 02:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
together because um he he started that
 
02:02:47.209 --> 02:02:47.219 align:start position:0%
and and for a final follow-up and and is
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that by not using the
 
02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
hybrid form but and not enumerating
 
02:02:57.890 --> 02:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
people you avoid the problem that we
 
02:03:01.490 --> 02:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
heard referenced yesterday where one
 
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
Association is favored over another
 
02:03:05.870 --> 02:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
Association this permits you to gather
 
02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
all the people who have an interest
 
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
and then figure out how to include them
 
02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
in your structure going forward
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
so it's probably a better
 
02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
structure than the hybrid or the
 
02:03:21.410 --> 02:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
commission I would agree with that thank
 
02:03:25.850 --> 02:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
you I also don't want to forget we Myra
 
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
Christopher wrote the forward in my book
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
she's one of my favorite people on the
 
02:03:31.729 --> 02:03:31.739 align:start position:0%
planet and Myra always insisted that a
 
02:03:33.770 --> 02:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
patient or two or three or four be
 
02:03:36.109 --> 02:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
involved in this process and it's
 
02:03:37.970 --> 02:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
important that they be involved as well
 
02:03:39.649 --> 02:03:39.659 align:start position:0%
we don't want to eliminate them because
 
02:03:41.149 --> 02:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
they know a lot more about this than we
 
02:03:44.209 --> 02:03:44.219 align:start position:0%
do representative Palmer
 
02:03:45.770 --> 02:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:03:49.250 --> 02:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
um this is a sort of a question about
 
02:03:51.649 --> 02:03:51.659 align:start position:0%
who's going to be involved so one of the
 
02:03:53.450 --> 02:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
I just had a meeting with the American
 
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
college Physicians and one of the
 
02:03:57.169 --> 02:03:57.179 align:start position:0%
concerns is their their primary goal is
 
02:03:59.089 --> 02:03:59.099 align:start position:0%
taking care of patients and in the last
 
02:04:01.729 --> 02:04:01.739 align:start position:0%
years what's happened is that doctors
 
02:04:03.649 --> 02:04:03.659 align:start position:0%
have really and and other providers have
 
02:04:06.890 --> 02:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
been really embattled and struggling and
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
so they've been trying to put a you know
 
02:04:11.450 --> 02:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
a real emphasis on making sure that the
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
people who are providing the care to
 
02:04:16.129 --> 02:04:16.139 align:start position:0%
patients are healthy and happy and
 
02:04:20.209 --> 02:04:20.219 align:start position:0%
um so my question here is for example in
 
02:04:21.890 --> 02:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
in and I don't not sure in New Hampshire
 
02:04:23.209 --> 02:04:23.219 align:start position:0%
because I practice only in Vermont
 
02:04:24.770 --> 02:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
though I'm here
 
02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:25.490 align:start position:0%
though I'm here
um

02:04:25.490 --> 02:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:29.629 --> 02:04:29.639 align:start position:0%
with the prescription monitoring issue
 
02:04:32.209 --> 02:04:32.219 align:start position:0%
we we have a new form and a whole
 
02:04:34.010 --> 02:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
procedure we need to follow whenever we
 
02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:35.570 align:start position:0%
procedure we need to follow whenever we
prescribe

02:04:35.570 --> 02:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
prescribe
 
02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
um opiates and that has led to a
 
02:04:40.070 --> 02:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
decrease in opiate prescription for in
 
02:04:42.109 --> 02:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
from in most cases for better in some
 
02:04:44.149 --> 02:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
cases for worse that you alluded to I
 
02:04:45.649 --> 02:04:45.659 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that on this
 
02:04:47.629 --> 02:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
committee you have that kind of input so
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
whatever comes out of it is going to
 
02:04:50.510 --> 02:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
make it
 
02:04:53.709 --> 02:04:53.719 align:start position:0%
not a cumbersome process for people to
 
02:04:58.010 --> 02:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
access whatever modalities they're
 
02:04:59.689 --> 02:04:59.699 align:start position:0%
trying to prescribe
 
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:05:03.410 --> 02:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer as it happens I
 
02:05:04.669 --> 02:05:04.679 align:start position:0%
also serve on the prescription drug
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
monitoring program as advisory Council
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
so yes we will have linkage between that
 
02:05:11.209 --> 02:05:11.219 align:start position:0%
and what we're doing today
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
other questions can I answer that as
 
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
well sure you're going to get a
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
long-winded answer and we can do that as
 
02:05:19.550 --> 02:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
a sidebar I I there's a whole chapter in
 
02:05:22.129 --> 02:05:22.139 align:start position:0%
my book on what you just asked
 
02:05:22.139 --> 02:05:23.209 align:start position:0%
my book on what you just asked
um

02:05:23.209 --> 02:05:23.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not convinced that we as doctors
 
02:05:28.729 --> 02:05:28.739 align:start position:0%
really have our patients best interests
 
02:05:31.189 --> 02:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
in mind anymore and I'd be happy to
 
02:05:33.229 --> 02:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
discuss that in Greater deal if you wish
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
and the whole purpose of everything that
 
02:05:38.089 --> 02:05:38.099 align:start position:0%
we're doing is to try to bring
 
02:05:40.490 --> 02:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
everything back to the patient away from
 
02:05:43.250 --> 02:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
the corporate structure away from
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
um you know the comp the computer
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
because my patients tell me that they
 
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
don't think their Doctors Care that NFL
 
02:05:51.050 --> 02:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
athlete said they don't care and it's
 
02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
usually because of things that are
 
02:05:55.550 --> 02:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
extraneous to them that's changed all
 
02:05:57.890 --> 02:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
that and I that's why patients are
 
02:06:00.109 --> 02:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
important I think we've overemphasized
 
02:06:02.089 --> 02:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
the problem with opioids and that's a
 
02:06:06.169 --> 02:06:06.179 align:start position:0%
sidebar discussion too I I'm bothered by
 
02:06:08.450 --> 02:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
that because I I know of a we have a
 
02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
list we call it our suicide watch of
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
patients that have been died because of
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
being abandoned
 
02:06:15.709 --> 02:06:15.719 align:start position:0%
um and and those are important issues to
 
02:06:16.910 --> 02:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
me thank you
 
02:06:20.689 --> 02:06:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:23.330 --> 02:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
representative McKay
 
02:06:27.890 --> 02:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:30.169 --> 02:06:30.179 align:start position:0%
chair my background is in the mental
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
health field
 
02:06:35.089 --> 02:06:35.099 align:start position:0%
I'll make this very short I had some
 
02:06:37.729 --> 02:06:37.739 align:start position:0%
kind of minor surgery at frankly had
 
02:06:40.729 --> 02:06:40.739 align:start position:0%
forgotten what it was uh they gave me
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
these pills I took two
 
02:06:46.910 --> 02:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
one and two and stopped because I was
 
02:06:49.490 --> 02:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
looking forward to the next one
 
02:06:52.070 --> 02:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
now in the mental health field that to
 
02:06:55.790 --> 02:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
me that smells like addiction
 
02:06:58.490 --> 02:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
and so nobody told me to do anything I
 
02:07:01.129 --> 02:07:01.139 align:start position:0%
just did what I thought was important I
 
02:07:04.189 --> 02:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
went to Concord police station and put
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
those pills in that container even
 
02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
though one of my neighbors said those
 
02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
are worth 75 dollars a piece if you want
 
02:07:15.229 --> 02:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
to sell them I didn't in other words
 
02:07:18.290 --> 02:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is that it's very
 
02:07:22.010 --> 02:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
important to involve the patient which
 
02:07:25.550 --> 02:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
we all are pretty much in this kind of
 
02:07:30.830 --> 02:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
terrible addiction and to uh what I did
 
02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
was very simple
 
02:07:34.490 --> 02:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
but I think it probably stopped
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
something that could have been quite
 
02:07:40.070 --> 02:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
serious so I just wanted to add that on
 
02:07:43.129 --> 02:07:43.139 align:start position:0%
okay thank you go ahead representative
 
02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
Merchant if I could if I'll open
 
02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
resident McKay
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that we'd be
 
02:07:50.450 --> 02:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
looking for on the study committee is
 
02:07:52.609 --> 02:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
members from this committee are people
 
02:07:54.290 --> 02:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
within the house that serve and help
 
02:07:56.330 --> 02:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
walk through it if you be willing to be
 
02:07:59.649 --> 02:07:59.659 align:start position:0%
part of that I'd be more than glad to
 
02:08:01.729 --> 02:08:01.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:03.649 --> 02:08:03.659 align:start position:0%
I'm thrilled to death you said that
 
02:08:06.770 --> 02:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
that's another sidebar discussion
 
02:08:09.770 --> 02:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
um we don't manage prescriptions well
 
02:08:11.330 --> 02:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
and I think we need to do a lot better
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
job and I that should be part of our
 
02:08:15.649 --> 02:08:15.659 align:start position:0%
discussion too
 
02:08:19.490 --> 02:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:21.589 --> 02:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
saying no other questions okay thank you
 
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
gentlemen thanks thank you
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
I have no one signed up to testify on
 
02:08:27.649 --> 02:08:27.659 align:start position:0%
this bill other than these two gentlemen
 
02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to testify on HB
 
02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:33.109 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to testify on HB
66.

02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
66.
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
if not I am going to if not I am going
 
02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
to close the public hearing on hb66 and
 
02:08:42.050 --> 02:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on HB 500
 
02:08:44.089 --> 02:08:44.099 align:start position:0%
and recognize the prime sponsor
 
02:08:57.370 --> 02:08:57.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:59.450 --> 02:08:59.460 align:start position:0%
oh just
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
we just did 66.
 
02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.890 align:start position:0%
we just did 66.
500.

02:09:06.890 --> 02:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:06.900 --> 02:09:19.089 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:09:19.089 --> 02:09:19.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
good morning representative how are you
 
02:09:23.689 --> 02:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair
 
02:09:23.699 --> 02:09:24.470 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair
um

02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:26.089 --> 02:09:26.099 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is representative
 
02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
Mary hacken Phillips I represent Grafton
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
County District 12 which covers Hanover
 
02:09:32.750 --> 02:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
and lime
 
02:09:34.850 --> 02:09:34.860 align:start position:0%
if the committee is ready I'll dive in
 
02:09:37.370 --> 02:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead so I'm here to introduce
 
02:09:40.250 --> 02:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
HB 500 relative to prescribing opioids
 
02:09:42.169 --> 02:09:42.179 align:start position:0%
via Telehealth medicine
 
02:09:44.149 --> 02:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
I'm here actually today because a number
 
02:09:46.570 --> 02:09:46.580 align:start position:0%
of constituents who live in our district
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
that I also serve with representative
 
02:09:52.330 --> 02:09:52.340 align:start position:0%
Murphy our practicing surgeons at dhmc
 
02:09:56.030 --> 02:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
in Lebanon and recently
 
02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
I think it was November they brought to
 
02:10:00.350 --> 02:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
my attention an upcoming change in the
 
02:10:02.750 --> 02:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
law that they were going to be required
 
02:10:05.209 --> 02:10:05.219 align:start position:0%
um to change their current practices and
 
02:10:07.250 --> 02:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that in January of
 
02:10:09.649 --> 02:10:09.659 align:start position:0%
this year coinciding with the expiration
 
02:10:11.410 --> 02:10:11.420 align:start position:0%
of some federal federal
 
02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
flexibility in regulations related to
 
02:10:16.609 --> 02:10:16.619 align:start position:0%
Telehealth medicine
 
02:10:20.570 --> 02:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
that these Physicians were um
 
02:10:22.970 --> 02:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
being asked to change their normal
 
02:10:25.129 --> 02:10:25.139 align:start position:0%
practice of prescribing opioids either
 
02:10:27.709 --> 02:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
new or refill prescriptions of any
 
02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:30.599 align:start position:0%
scheduled two to four opioid drugs
 
02:10:33.169 --> 02:10:33.179 align:start position:0%
um just a side note here that's limited
 
02:10:35.570 --> 02:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
exception for Methadone hydrochloride
 
02:10:37.850 --> 02:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
and I'll let the experts behind me speak
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
to that issue
 
02:10:41.870 --> 02:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
but this change in prescription for New
 
02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire patients affected specifically
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
telephone and audio visual Telehealth
 
02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:48.830 align:start position:0%
telephone and audio visual Telehealth
visits

02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
visits
 
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
um with their patients to accommodate a
 
02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
change in New Hampshire law specifically
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
RSA 329 colon 1-d related to Physicians
 
02:11:01.689 --> 02:11:01.699 align:start position:0%
and surgeons and
 
02:11:04.810 --> 02:11:04.820 align:start position:0%
326-b colon 2 which is related to
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
nursing this change in law required any
 
02:11:11.089 --> 02:11:11.099 align:start position:0%
new or refill opioid script to be issued
 
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
with an in-person visit with that
 
02:11:16.250 --> 02:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
patient regardless if the provider had
 
02:11:17.930 --> 02:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
already established an in-person
 
02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
relationship with that patient
 
02:11:22.609 --> 02:11:22.619 align:start position:0%
so to be clear this in-person visit
 
02:11:25.070 --> 02:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
requirement is a much more restrictive
 
02:11:29.629 --> 02:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
practice than the past and then our
 
02:11:31.370 --> 02:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
current New England Neighbors in Vermont
 
02:11:33.169 --> 02:11:33.179 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Maine are practicing
 
02:11:35.570 --> 02:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
this is bringing this to your attention
 
02:11:37.310 --> 02:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
because it's adversely affecting our
 
02:11:40.010 --> 02:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
state's Healthcare systems
 
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
so to try to give you an example of what
 
02:11:44.209 --> 02:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about let's just walk
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
through a scenario say you've recently
 
02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
had a major surgery it required you to
 
02:11:50.689 --> 02:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
be hospitalized for 24 to 30 hours after
 
02:11:52.070 --> 02:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
that surgery
 
02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
the good news is that on post-op day two
 
02:11:57.530 --> 02:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
you are doing well and you're going to
 
02:12:00.050 --> 02:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
be discharged to go home and conval us
 
02:12:02.209 --> 02:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
you spend several hours headed home with
 
02:12:03.770 --> 02:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
the help of your friends or loved ones
 
02:12:05.689 --> 02:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
and you finally get in your own bed to
 
02:12:05.699 --> 02:12:06.950 align:start position:0%
and you finally get in your own bed to
rest

02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
rest
 
02:12:08.450 --> 02:12:08.460 align:start position:0%
but late that night you wake up with
 
02:12:09.709 --> 02:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
some pain
 
02:12:11.450 --> 02:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
the issue is that the powerful drugs
 
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
used to during your surgery and during
 
02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
your stay at the hospital are wearing
 
02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:16.910 align:start position:0%
your stay at the hospital are wearing
off

02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
off
 
02:12:18.649 --> 02:12:18.659 align:start position:0%
you told yourself and your doctor that
 
02:12:19.850 --> 02:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
you didn't believe you would need an
 
02:12:21.410 --> 02:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
opioid to go home when you were
 
02:12:23.330 --> 02:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
discharged but now that you're there
 
02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
things have changed and you realize you
 
02:12:27.109 --> 02:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
need help
 
02:12:29.149 --> 02:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
you call your doctor's emergency line to
 
02:12:30.530 --> 02:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
ask for a small script to get you
 
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
through the next few days of surgical
 
02:12:36.290 --> 02:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
recovery before in under current law
 
02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:37.250 align:start position:0%
recovery before in under current law
um

02:12:37.250 --> 02:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
your doctor will be able to you know
 
02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
your doctor who just saw you two or
 
02:12:42.109 --> 02:12:42.119 align:start position:0%
three days before would be able to give
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
a call to your local 24-hour pharmacy
 
02:12:46.669 --> 02:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
call on that script and get you that
 
02:12:48.530 --> 02:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
small prescription
 
02:12:51.290 --> 02:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
but under this new law your doctor would
 
02:12:52.370 --> 02:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
have to tell you that you'll have to
 
02:12:54.890 --> 02:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
return to the hospital and see her in
 
02:12:57.290 --> 02:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
clinic which may actually be the
 
02:12:59.149 --> 02:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
following week on a specific day that
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
that surgeon has Clinic
 
02:13:03.530 --> 02:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
it may not be right away
 
02:13:05.629 --> 02:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
this is less than ideal because you have
 
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
no more time to take off of work your
 
02:13:09.229 --> 02:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
friends and loved ones can't help you
 
02:13:12.109 --> 02:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
with the trip back and frankly gas money
 
02:13:15.050 --> 02:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:17.209 --> 02:13:17.219 align:start position:0%
so meanwhile your pain is not stopping
 
02:13:18.770 --> 02:13:18.780 align:start position:0%
and it's getting worse so you're gonna
 
02:13:21.709 --> 02:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
scramble you may seek urgent help in an
 
02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
ER or
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
um which first of all we all know that
 
02:13:26.930 --> 02:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
ERS are overloaded right now just
 
02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:28.310 align:start position:0%
ERS are overloaded right now just
anecdotally

02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
anecdotally
 
02:13:30.050 --> 02:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
or you may call your primary care
 
02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
physician and attempt to get an
 
02:13:33.950 --> 02:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
appointment there but you may also know
 
02:13:36.050 --> 02:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that getting in to see a
 
02:13:37.490 --> 02:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
primary care physician could be more
 
02:13:39.970 --> 02:13:39.980 align:start position:0%
than a Year's wait at this time
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
alternatively your provider your health
 
02:13:46.189 --> 02:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
care physician or nurse May plan ahead
 
02:13:48.290 --> 02:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
and determine to go against the last two
 
02:13:50.209 --> 02:13:50.219 align:start position:0%
decades or more of academic research in
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
the field of studying over prescribing
 
02:13:54.229 --> 02:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
of opioids and the good work over the
 
02:13:56.209 --> 02:13:56.219 align:start position:0%
past decade of combating the opioid
 
02:13:58.729 --> 02:13:58.739 align:start position:0%
pandemic and preemptively discharge
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
patient patients with an opioid script
 
02:14:02.990 --> 02:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
and the off chance that they need these
 
02:14:05.689 --> 02:14:05.699 align:start position:0%
pills once they are discharged
 
02:14:08.569 --> 02:14:08.579 align:start position:0%
you know thereby flooding our state with
 
02:14:10.609 --> 02:14:10.619 align:start position:0%
additional opioids that we all know is
 
02:14:12.649 --> 02:14:12.659 align:start position:0%
not needed
 
02:14:14.450 --> 02:14:14.460 align:start position:0%
um so this example shows you how current
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
law creates a very desperate situation
 
02:14:19.010 --> 02:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
that comes that is completely avoidable
 
02:14:21.169 --> 02:14:21.179 align:start position:0%
and this bill attempts to do a little
 
02:14:22.550 --> 02:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
something to try to correct that
 
02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:24.169 align:start position:0%
something to try to correct that
situation

02:14:24.169 --> 02:14:24.179 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:14:26.990 --> 02:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to walk you through the uh one
 
02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
page of language here in the bill if the
 
02:14:31.370 --> 02:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
committee would like so but before I do
 
02:14:32.689 --> 02:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
that I want to get out of the way so
 
02:14:34.189 --> 02:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
that the committee can hear from the
 
02:14:36.770 --> 02:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
experts in this matter
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
my job to my job today is to briefly
 
02:14:41.689 --> 02:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
explain a few points of why this
 
02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
legislation is needed
 
02:14:45.050 --> 02:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
the first
 
02:14:45.060 --> 02:14:45.770 align:start position:0%
the first
um

02:14:45.770 --> 02:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:47.209 --> 02:14:47.219 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with the current law
 
02:14:49.609 --> 02:14:49.619 align:start position:0%
is economic
 
02:14:51.530 --> 02:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
we understand requiring patients to
 
02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:52.669 align:start position:0%
we understand requiring patients to
travel

02:14:52.669 --> 02:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
travel
 
02:14:55.129 --> 02:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
another time is expensive when many
 
02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
folks already don't have the cash in
 
02:14:59.209 --> 02:14:59.219 align:start position:0%
their Banks bank accounts to make an
 
02:15:01.550 --> 02:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
extra trip to see their doctors when
 
02:15:03.770 --> 02:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
we're talking about confronting soaring
 
02:15:05.689 --> 02:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
Energy prices and inflationary pressures
 
02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
and other economic tough times it's
 
02:15:10.850 --> 02:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
really forcing patients to do without
 
02:15:15.410 --> 02:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
critical critical pain relief and this
 
02:15:16.850 --> 02:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
is really cruel
 
02:15:18.649 --> 02:15:18.659 align:start position:0%
current law also puts some of New
 
02:15:20.209 --> 02:15:20.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's largest employers at a
 
02:15:22.010 --> 02:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
competitive disadvantage with their
 
02:15:23.810 --> 02:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
Vermont Massachusetts and Maine
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
competitors who I'm sorry their peers
 
02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
who prescribe opioids via Telehealth
 
02:15:32.089 --> 02:15:32.099 align:start position:0%
when we all know that the marketplace
 
02:15:33.649 --> 02:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
right now in the healthcare is extremely
 
02:15:33.659 --> 02:15:34.569 align:start position:0%
right now in the healthcare is extremely
tight

02:15:34.569 --> 02:15:34.579 align:start position:0%
tight
 
02:15:37.129 --> 02:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
this point cannot be understated this is
 
02:15:40.189 --> 02:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
a competitive disadvantage for our state
 
02:15:42.109 --> 02:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
the next problem with this current law
 
02:15:44.089 --> 02:15:44.099 align:start position:0%
is logistic requiring people to travel
 
02:15:46.510 --> 02:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
again across the state multiple hours
 
02:15:49.370 --> 02:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
when business can be conducted safely
 
02:15:50.750 --> 02:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
over the telephone or with an audio
 
02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:51.910 align:start position:0%
over the telephone or with an audio
visual

02:15:51.910 --> 02:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
visual
 
02:15:55.370 --> 02:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
Telehealth medicine visit is just silly
 
02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
I mean frankly extra chips mean extra
 
02:16:00.470 --> 02:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
emissions extra costs we don't
 
02:16:02.569 --> 02:16:02.579 align:start position:0%
logistically we're crowding the roads
 
02:16:04.490 --> 02:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
and creating more problem that's really
 
02:16:04.500 --> 02:16:05.689 align:start position:0%
and creating more problem that's really
needed

02:16:05.689 --> 02:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:16:07.790 --> 02:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
the third issue is Administrative
 
02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
efficiency requiring an already short
 
02:16:13.010 --> 02:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
Workforce to duplicate efforts and find
 
02:16:15.890 --> 02:16:15.900 align:start position:0%
another time for an in-person visit puts
 
02:16:17.330 --> 02:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
additional stress on a system that's
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
already experiencing historic challenges
 
02:16:22.010 --> 02:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
wait times are already extremely a lot
 
02:16:25.250 --> 02:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
long to just get that first appointment
 
02:16:27.770 --> 02:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
so let's help our providers out at a
 
02:16:30.530 --> 02:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
time when burnout is high and stress on
 
02:16:33.349 --> 02:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
the system is coming out stressing the
 
02:16:34.870 --> 02:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
system coming out of the corner of
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
coronavirus pandemic is already at an
 
02:16:39.469 --> 02:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
all-time high let's do something about
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know a small thing that can help out
 
02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
the system
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
fourth Uh current law is problematic
 
02:16:48.589 --> 02:16:48.599 align:start position:0%
because it's overly paternalistic we
 
02:16:50.570 --> 02:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
know that there are already Federal and
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
professional guard rails in place to
 
02:16:55.070 --> 02:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
make prescribing opioids safe
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
via Telehealth medicine emits a deeply
 
02:16:59.870 --> 02:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
concerning opioid pandemic
 
02:17:01.849 --> 02:17:01.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does not need to pile on
 
02:17:04.129 --> 02:17:04.139 align:start position:0%
extra red tape and regulations here it
 
02:17:06.349 --> 02:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
is safely regulated
 
02:17:08.929 --> 02:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
fifth the problem is a human one
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
our current law is going to make all of
 
02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
us suffer whether you're the patient
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
seeking the actual new or a refill
 
02:17:17.209 --> 02:17:17.219 align:start position:0%
prescription of opioids or you're
 
02:17:18.290 --> 02:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
someone else
 
02:17:20.330 --> 02:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
seeking care with your primary care
 
02:17:23.570 --> 02:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
physician or in the ER trying to get
 
02:17:25.549 --> 02:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
emergency care or at some other access
 
02:17:27.530 --> 02:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
point in a Health Care system
 
02:17:30.349 --> 02:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
the bottleneck this law creates is a
 
02:17:31.730 --> 02:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
strain of resources and precious
 
02:17:34.009 --> 02:17:34.019 align:start position:0%
provider time it's going to adversely
 
02:17:35.929 --> 02:17:35.939 align:start position:0%
affect our system in all of us who take
 
02:17:37.849 --> 02:17:37.859 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
02:17:39.429 --> 02:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
people are going to suffer needlessly
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
and for the delay and care and sometimes
 
02:17:44.929 --> 02:17:44.939 align:start position:0%
bypass the care altogether because of
 
02:17:46.310 --> 02:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
the current law
 
02:17:49.610 --> 02:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
so what you have today before you HB 5
 
02:17:49.620 --> 02:17:51.770 align:start position:0%
so what you have today before you HB 5
500

02:17:51.770 --> 02:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
500
 
02:17:53.750 --> 02:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
is a fix on what I believe to be an
 
02:17:56.209 --> 02:17:56.219 align:start position:0%
inadvertent hiccup in current Telehealth
 
02:17:56.219 --> 02:17:57.230 align:start position:0%
inadvertent hiccup in current Telehealth
law

02:17:57.230 --> 02:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
the drafted language was a result of DHS
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
coordination and Leadership thanks to
 
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
Matthew Hood and his team
 
02:18:05.929 --> 02:18:05.939 align:start position:0%
and others of course I believe this
 
02:18:07.669 --> 02:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
legislation will make a positive impact
 
02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
on our state so before I turn over the
 
02:18:12.770 --> 02:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
hearing to my co-sponsor if he plans to
 
02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
speak I'm not sure and other
 
02:18:18.009 --> 02:18:18.019 align:start position:0%
um folks here from Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
02:18:21.169 --> 02:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
and the healthcare profession
 
02:18:22.669 --> 02:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to just share that I've
 
02:18:24.589 --> 02:18:24.599 align:start position:0%
separately spoken to stakeholders at the
 
02:18:26.330 --> 02:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Medical Society and the
 
02:18:28.610 --> 02:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Psychiatric Society who
 
02:18:30.770 --> 02:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
are both groups are on board in support
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
of this legislation and I believe are
 
02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
submitting online testimony testimony to
 
02:18:35.690 --> 02:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
that effect
 
02:18:37.849 --> 02:18:37.859 align:start position:0%
so at this time I'd like to urge the
 
02:18:40.849 --> 02:18:40.859 align:start position:0%
committee to OTP HB 500 thank you for
 
02:18:42.169 --> 02:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
your time and consideration and I'm
 
02:18:44.270 --> 02:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions a question
 
02:18:46.790 --> 02:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
just representative Weber
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so now turning to the bill
 
02:18:54.410 --> 02:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lot of very great policy
 
02:18:57.469 --> 02:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
but I need to understand how this bill
 
02:19:00.410 --> 02:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
furthers it and I'm just looking at the
 
02:19:02.509 --> 02:19:02.519 align:start position:0%
language of the bill first of all on
 
02:19:04.969 --> 02:19:04.979 align:start position:0%
line one there is a reference to
 
02:19:07.009 --> 02:19:07.019 align:start position:0%
out-of-state Physicians and I don't see
 
02:19:08.750 --> 02:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
anything in the bill about out-of-state
 
02:19:11.929 --> 02:19:11.939 align:start position:0%
Physicians nor does it nor is it
 
02:19:15.950 --> 02:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
inserted in a place in the statute that
 
02:19:18.169 --> 02:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
is restricted to out-of-state Physicians
 
02:19:21.950 --> 02:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
so I if I may ask the first question why
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
is that there my understanding is that
 
02:19:28.730 --> 02:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
the chapter RSA 329 colon 1 slash D
 
02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:30.169 align:start position:0%
the chapter RSA 329 colon 1 slash D
regulates

02:19:30.169 --> 02:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
regulates
 
02:19:32.629 --> 02:19:32.639 align:start position:0%
tahov medicine for surgeons and
 
02:19:35.450 --> 02:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
Physicians I think that the sub chapter
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
out of state Physicians is just part of
 
02:19:40.849 --> 02:19:40.859 align:start position:0%
the order that it comes down to the RSA
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
um so to answer your question I don't
 
02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
think it only has to do with
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
out-of-state positions it creates any
 
02:19:48.589 --> 02:19:48.599 align:start position:0%
physician it creates effect to any
 
02:19:51.650 --> 02:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
physician that serves in the state of
 
02:19:53.630 --> 02:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for a patient in New
 
02:19:53.640 --> 02:19:54.950 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for a patient in New
Hampshire

02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:19:57.170 --> 02:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
okay so I will
 
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
may I have a follow-up I guess this is
 
02:20:03.710 --> 02:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps um one of the details that
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
office of legislative Services may have
 
02:20:06.479 --> 02:20:09.130 align:start position:0%
office of legislative Services may have
overlooked

02:20:09.130 --> 02:20:09.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
you've answered my my question in that
 
02:20:15.230 --> 02:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
you wanted to apply to everybody
 
02:20:17.270 --> 02:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
so we just need to investigate the
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
drafting uh then
 
02:20:22.670 --> 02:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
for the follow-up
 
02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:28.670 align:start position:0%
for the follow-up
um

02:20:28.670 --> 02:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:33.050 --> 02:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
all what you're doing is what you're
 
02:20:33.060 --> 02:20:35.630 align:start position:0%
all what you're doing is what you're
doing

02:20:35.630 --> 02:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:39.650 --> 02:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
the number one talks about what
 
02:20:43.250 --> 02:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
Physicians are going to do number two
 
02:20:46.910 --> 02:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh talks about the use of telemedicine
 
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
for nursing
 
02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:50.510 align:start position:0%
for nursing
and

02:20:50.510 --> 02:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:50.520 --> 02:20:53.330 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:20:53.330 --> 02:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:55.370 --> 02:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
and it's just the Physicians and the
 
02:20:57.290 --> 02:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
nurses that you're discussing here is
 
02:20:59.929 --> 02:20:59.939 align:start position:0%
that correct yes I think those are the
 
02:21:02.809 --> 02:21:02.819 align:start position:0%
two major pieces of legislation that
 
02:21:04.730 --> 02:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
currently control opioid prescriptions
 
02:21:07.610 --> 02:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
through Telehealth medicine so this is
 
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
where we've concentrated the effort on
 
02:21:12.349 --> 02:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
those two groups essentially and one
 
02:21:13.990 --> 02:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
final question
 
02:21:15.790 --> 02:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
and is this not an issue of uh nurse
 
02:21:23.230 --> 02:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
practitioners or advanced practice
 
02:21:25.550 --> 02:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
nurses of any sort
 
02:21:28.370 --> 02:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
uh because I I know that we've often had
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
to revise four sections or five sections
 
02:21:34.429 --> 02:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
and they may just not prescribe this
 
02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
kind of thing within their scope of
 
02:21:38.750 --> 02:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
practice and only if you know so um I
 
02:21:40.190 --> 02:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
can answer this question in two steps
 
02:21:41.330 --> 02:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
question first um if you'll see
 
02:21:45.710 --> 02:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
subsection B and C under
 
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
um paragraph two
 
02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:49.130 align:start position:0%
um paragraph two
um

02:21:49.130 --> 02:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:51.889 --> 02:21:51.899 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry B also speaks to the APRN
 
02:21:54.590 --> 02:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
issue that you just brought up but only
 
02:21:57.050 --> 02:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
02:21:57.060 --> 02:21:58.730 align:start position:0%
out of state
yes

02:21:58.730 --> 02:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:22:00.770 --> 02:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
um and then that may go back to the
 
02:22:02.570 --> 02:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
previous concern you had about the out
 
02:22:04.190 --> 02:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
of state my understanding is that this
 
02:22:06.349 --> 02:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
legislation is geared for in-state
 
02:22:08.090 --> 02:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
provider Healthcare Providers both
 
02:22:08.100 --> 02:22:09.530 align:start position:0%
provider Healthcare Providers both
Physicians

02:22:09.530 --> 02:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
Physicians
 
02:22:13.730 --> 02:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
surgeons and nurses so um I will again I
 
02:22:15.410 --> 02:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
put that under the first concern that we
 
02:22:17.030 --> 02:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
spoke to
 
02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you and then I guess I would
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
like to just follow up with the you know
 
02:22:22.790 --> 02:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
finish that thought and say I am not an
 
02:22:25.429 --> 02:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
expert in the field of medicine I
 
02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney by trade so
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
um I will defer the more ins and outs
 
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
scientific technical questions to the
 
02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
folks who are going to come after me
 
02:22:37.370 --> 02:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
today and speak to the issue thank you
 
02:22:39.469 --> 02:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
02:22:39.479 --> 02:22:42.770 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
Shapiro

02:22:42.770 --> 02:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:45.650 --> 02:22:45.660 align:start position:0%
thank people
 
02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
is your microphone on
 
02:22:50.450 --> 02:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:22:52.730 --> 02:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking this question
 
02:22:54.770 --> 02:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm having a little trouble reading
 
02:22:58.670 --> 02:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
this bill in the context of the RSA so I
 
02:23:01.490 --> 02:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
may be missing something but much of the
 
02:23:05.570 --> 02:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
bolded text has to do with
 
02:23:08.030 --> 02:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
um seems to me maybe I don't understand
 
02:23:11.809 --> 02:23:11.819 align:start position:0%
it making it unlawful for Methadone to
 
02:23:16.190 --> 02:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
be prescribed by telemedicine is that
 
02:23:19.309 --> 02:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
your intention so my understanding is
 
02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
that there is a that the methadone and
 
02:23:25.550 --> 02:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder category is
 
02:23:27.889 --> 02:23:27.899 align:start position:0%
separate from this legislation so
 
02:23:29.929 --> 02:23:29.939 align:start position:0%
there's a special carve out for that so
 
02:23:32.150 --> 02:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
it's not included it's my understanding
 
02:23:34.070 --> 02:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
but we will have folks here who can
 
02:23:36.110 --> 02:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
speak to those
 
02:23:39.910 --> 02:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
um ins and outs yeah who follow me
 
02:23:42.110 --> 02:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:23:46.670 --> 02:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this to us
 
02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:47.330 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this to us
um

02:23:47.330 --> 02:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
as I was trying to look at this section
 
02:23:52.610 --> 02:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
um it looks it looks to me I'm not an
 
02:23:53.929 --> 02:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
attorney but reading through here it
 
02:23:55.550 --> 02:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
appears that there's already that
 
02:23:58.309 --> 02:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
section that you reference which is
 
02:24:01.610 --> 02:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
um 12d that already provides for all of
 
02:24:03.770 --> 02:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
the non-substance use disorder opioid
 
02:24:06.650 --> 02:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
uses yeah so that's you're I think you
 
02:24:07.969 --> 02:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
are correct that that's why it's an
 
02:24:09.770 --> 02:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
exception from this legislation it's
 
02:24:11.570 --> 02:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
already there's already special language
 
02:24:13.490 --> 02:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:24:13.500 --> 02:24:14.090 align:start position:0%
for that
um

02:24:14.090 --> 02:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:17.210 --> 02:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
medicinal prescription
 
02:24:19.730 --> 02:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
02:24:23.330 --> 02:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
so my might the explanation be as one
 
02:24:25.490 --> 02:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
who was been involved with this
 
02:24:27.349 --> 02:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
paragraph for longer than I care to
 
02:24:28.330 --> 02:24:28.340 align:start position:0%
think about
 
02:24:34.809 --> 02:24:34.819 align:start position:0%
that the existing Roman 3
 
02:24:38.990 --> 02:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:42.349 --> 02:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
prescription of tele of any two through
 
02:24:47.690 --> 02:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
four drug So currently it's disallowed
 
02:24:49.969 --> 02:24:49.979 align:start position:0%
um and this allows
 
02:24:55.610 --> 02:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
everything but methadone and drops
 
02:24:58.670 --> 02:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
the other things down to paragraph four
 
02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
which is the allowance part which is not
 
02:25:04.670 --> 02:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps terribly clear to begin with but
 
02:25:07.550 --> 02:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
might be clearer afterwards
 
02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
your belief is my belief thank you thank
 
02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:10.910 align:start position:0%
your belief is my belief thank you thank
you

02:25:10.910 --> 02:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:25:12.889 --> 02:25:12.899 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
02:25:12.899 --> 02:25:14.929 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
Merchant

02:25:14.929 --> 02:25:14.939 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
02:25:16.610 --> 02:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
02:25:20.450 --> 02:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
the part that's referring to the
 
02:25:21.650 --> 02:25:21.660 align:start position:0%
methadone is really controlled by
 
02:25:23.450 --> 02:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
federal law versus state law
 
02:25:25.250 --> 02:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
so that's what you're touching upon I
 
02:25:27.230 --> 02:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
think but in saying that federal law
 
02:25:29.110 --> 02:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
through the emergency
 
02:25:33.050 --> 02:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
orders currently does allow for a
 
02:25:34.969 --> 02:25:34.979 align:start position:0%
existing patient to be treated with
 
02:25:37.190 --> 02:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
methadone through Telehealth would you
 
02:25:39.050 --> 02:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
be opposed by adding that language as
 
02:25:40.309 --> 02:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
long as it doesn't conflict with the
 
02:25:42.889 --> 02:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
federal law because many times for a lot
 
02:25:44.270 --> 02:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
of the patients who are being treated
 
02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
with methadone
 
02:25:47.690 --> 02:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
they have traveled a long ways which you
 
02:25:49.610 --> 02:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
brought it before so would you be
 
02:25:52.190 --> 02:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
opposed to trying to tailor this to what
 
02:25:55.010 --> 02:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
the federal law does allow to allow for
 
02:25:57.469 --> 02:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
people who are getting methadone not not
 
02:25:59.210 --> 02:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
to do patient but existing patients to
 
02:26:00.349 --> 02:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
be able to at that point in time not
 
02:26:01.490 --> 02:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
have to go all the way back two hours
 
02:26:03.050 --> 02:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
away from zero doc
 
02:26:04.969 --> 02:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Merchant for
 
02:26:07.550 --> 02:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
the question I'm gonna defer that
 
02:26:09.290 --> 02:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
response to the experts at Dartmouth
 
02:26:11.210 --> 02:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock who are here today to testify
 
02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
about that issue
 
02:26:15.050 --> 02:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
so the question just representative
 
02:26:15.060 --> 02:26:16.490 align:start position:0%
so the question just representative
Nagel

02:26:16.490 --> 02:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
Nagel
 
02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
02:26:19.309 --> 02:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:26:19.319 --> 02:26:19.969 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:26:19.969 --> 02:26:19.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:22.010 --> 02:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
this has been an entertaining discussion
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
because access to care is really
 
02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:25.190 align:start position:0%
because access to care is really
important

02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:26:27.889 --> 02:26:27.899 align:start position:0%
um I when I looked at this bill of media
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
that tell I mean I work with people with
 
02:26:31.429 --> 02:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
addiction I work with people in pain
 
02:26:34.490 --> 02:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
that methadone thing left off the page
 
02:26:37.630 --> 02:26:37.640 align:start position:0%
at me and our ability to prescribe that
 
02:26:40.370 --> 02:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
for people with addictions who live 200
 
02:26:44.270 --> 02:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
miles away from me is a huge issue I is
 
02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
it possible just get rid of that
 
02:26:47.389 --> 02:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
language in this bill altogether if it's
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:55.070 align:start position:0%
 
what

02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:26:57.110 --> 02:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
do you have to change the average say oh
 
02:26:58.849 --> 02:26:58.859 align:start position:0%
I don't mean that what what they've
 
02:26:58.859 --> 02:26:59.690 align:start position:0%
I don't mean that what what they've
added

02:26:59.690 --> 02:26:59.700 align:start position:0%
added
 
02:27:02.090 --> 02:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
the language they've added to to take
 
02:27:04.490 --> 02:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
that out of what you've added I don't
 
02:27:07.130 --> 02:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
understand why that's added again I I
 
02:27:09.410 --> 02:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
will defer to the folks that Dartmouth
 
02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
Health who are here today who helped
 
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
craft the language of this
 
02:27:15.530 --> 02:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
um draft so
 
02:27:17.870 --> 02:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
um they have far more expertise and
 
02:27:19.370 --> 02:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
understanding than I do of the issue so
 
02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
I will I appreciate that thank you
 
02:27:25.849 --> 02:27:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:34.969 --> 02:27:34.979 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
02:27:43.250 --> 02:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:44.750 --> 02:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'll come to the other side of the table
 
02:27:47.690 --> 02:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
02:27:49.969 --> 02:27:49.979 align:start position:0%
and again we can if we can do it in
 
02:27:52.550 --> 02:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
three minutes that'd be great
 
02:27:54.469 --> 02:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and on committee
 
02:27:55.730 --> 02:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
um uh for the record my name is Jim
 
02:27:58.490 --> 02:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
Murphy I represent Grafton 12 which is
 
02:28:00.830 --> 02:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
Hanover and lime along with um Mary Hack
 
02:28:03.410 --> 02:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
and Phillips and I'm here today to
 
02:28:03.420 --> 02:28:04.370 align:start position:0%
and Phillips and I'm here today to
support

02:28:04.370 --> 02:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:28:06.230 --> 02:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
um the bill I co-sponsored with um
 
02:28:08.510 --> 02:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative hacking Phillips uh house
 
02:28:11.690 --> 02:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
bill 500. so there's a a couple
 
02:28:13.610 --> 02:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
questions I would I think have to be
 
02:28:17.330 --> 02:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
answered first I know we have uh um Mr
 
02:28:20.510 --> 02:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
Matthew Hood from DH as well as one of
 
02:28:22.490 --> 02:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
the providers from DH that deals with it
 
02:28:24.170 --> 02:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
specifically but
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
um one of my first
 
02:28:28.670 --> 02:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
um uh issues with this bill is I think
 
02:28:30.650 --> 02:28:30.660 align:start position:0%
it's somewhat of a misnomer the bill
 
02:28:33.590 --> 02:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
basically says prescribing opioids the
 
02:28:35.450 --> 02:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
bill really is allowing the prescription
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
of schedule two to four that's a much
 
02:28:40.490 --> 02:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
broader and much more important in many
 
02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:41.929 align:start position:0%
broader and much more important in many
ways

02:28:41.929 --> 02:28:41.939 align:start position:0%
ways
 
02:28:44.990 --> 02:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I would mention is
 
02:28:47.530 --> 02:28:47.540 align:start position:0%
that Telehealth is here to stay
 
02:28:50.270 --> 02:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
Telehealth is grown substantially in the
 
02:28:52.969 --> 02:28:52.979 align:start position:0%
past 10 years for instance at Dartmouth
 
02:28:55.730 --> 02:28:55.740 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock in the Telehealth section I
 
02:28:58.849 --> 02:28:58.859 align:start position:0%
was talking to a doctor um
 
02:28:58.859 --> 02:29:01.130 align:start position:0%
was talking to a doctor um
um

02:29:01.130 --> 02:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:03.650 --> 02:29:03.660 align:start position:0%
Uh Kevin Curtis I'm sorry uh the other
 
02:29:06.050 --> 02:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
day and I've known him for a while he
 
02:29:09.050 --> 02:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
told me that prior to the pandemic this
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
is amazing we had only 12 outpatient
 
02:29:13.610 --> 02:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
visits per day in the Telehealth Clinic
 
02:29:15.889 --> 02:29:15.899 align:start position:0%
during the peak of the pandemic that
 
02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
went up to 2600 a day outpatient visits
 
02:29:21.290 --> 02:29:21.300 align:start position:0%
it now currently is plateaued around
 
02:29:23.030 --> 02:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
five to seven hundred so Telehealth is
 
02:29:25.429 --> 02:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
here to stay and I would say it now
 
02:29:29.270 --> 02:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
represents about 10 to 15 percent of the
 
02:29:30.889 --> 02:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
um tell of the outpatient visits at
 
02:29:32.750 --> 02:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth at this point in time but this
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
is not a bill about Telehealth I would
 
02:29:36.410 --> 02:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
also say it's not just a bill about
 
02:29:38.450 --> 02:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
opioids it's about schedule two to four
 
02:29:40.670 --> 02:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
which is much broader and to me this
 
02:29:42.349 --> 02:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
bill and I know we have experts behind
 
02:29:44.690 --> 02:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
me that deal with uh on a regular basis
 
02:29:47.389 --> 02:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
you know taking care of these patients
 
02:29:49.309 --> 02:29:49.319 align:start position:0%
um this is really a patient this is a
 
02:29:51.530 --> 02:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
bill to help support patients in very
 
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
difficult situations
 
02:29:54.240 --> 02:29:55.670 align:start position:0%
difficult situations
um

02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:58.030 --> 02:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
when I talked to Dr Curtis the other day
 
02:30:01.490 --> 02:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
we what is going on right now is that we
 
02:30:03.469 --> 02:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
were able to schedule
 
02:30:07.010 --> 02:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
two to four drugs via Telehealth during
 
02:30:08.510 --> 02:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
the emergency
 
02:30:11.870 --> 02:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
um uh period of time that will be lifted
 
02:30:14.809 --> 02:30:14.819 align:start position:0%
I believe on May 10th or 11th something
 
02:30:17.809 --> 02:30:17.819 align:start position:0%
I thank you when that happens we revert
 
02:30:20.330 --> 02:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
back to the rule whereby you are not
 
02:30:22.130 --> 02:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
allowed to prescribe by Telehealth
 
02:30:24.830 --> 02:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
scheduled two to four that is not just
 
02:30:28.610 --> 02:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
opioids when have we ever had a bill or
 
02:30:30.889 --> 02:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
a policy change come before us we've
 
02:30:33.710 --> 02:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
actually done the um the trial the
 
02:30:36.349 --> 02:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
clinical trial before it when I asked Dr
 
02:30:38.090 --> 02:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
Curtis what happened during the last
 
02:30:39.650 --> 02:30:39.660 align:start position:0%
past few years when they were allowed to
 
02:30:42.170 --> 02:30:42.180 align:start position:0%
prescribe opioids in other medications
 
02:30:44.570 --> 02:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
they actually had absolutely no problems
 
02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
whatsoever so to me that means that has
 
02:30:49.690 --> 02:30:49.700 align:start position:0%
already been tried and true
 
02:30:52.370 --> 02:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
process in the in in management of these
 
02:30:54.469 --> 02:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
patients they had absolutely no issues
 
02:30:54.479 --> 02:30:56.570 align:start position:0%
patients they had absolutely no issues
whatsoever

02:30:56.570 --> 02:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
02:30:58.910 --> 02:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
um and one of the other questions that
 
02:31:01.490 --> 02:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
just came up about methadone my inter my
 
02:31:03.050 --> 02:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
understanding about methadone is a
 
02:31:06.530 --> 02:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
schedule 2 drug and it has been carved
 
02:31:08.929 --> 02:31:08.939 align:start position:0%
out specifically by the feds because
 
02:31:12.170 --> 02:31:12.180 align:start position:0%
this is what they call a a drug that can
 
02:31:15.590 --> 02:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
prescribed only through Sam s-a-m-h-s-a
 
02:31:17.750 --> 02:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
which is Substance Abuse and Mental
 
02:31:19.730 --> 02:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
Health Service Administration and only
 
02:31:19.740 --> 02:31:20.929 align:start position:0%
Health Service Administration and only
by

02:31:20.929 --> 02:31:20.939 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:31:23.270 --> 02:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
otps which are opioid treatment programs
 
02:31:24.889 --> 02:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
now I'm not sure that could be
 
02:31:26.570 --> 02:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
incorporated into Telehealth I would
 
02:31:28.130 --> 02:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
leave that to the folks from DH to tell
 
02:31:30.170 --> 02:31:30.180 align:start position:0%
me that if that could happen or not but
 
02:31:32.450 --> 02:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
having said that I would like to speak
 
02:31:34.550 --> 02:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
mostly to the clinical side of this
 
02:31:36.110 --> 02:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
which I think is critically important
 
02:31:38.090 --> 02:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
this is not just opioid treatment in
 
02:31:40.370 --> 02:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
management it's chronic pain for many
 
02:31:43.010 --> 02:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
many variety of issues
 
02:31:45.170 --> 02:31:45.180 align:start position:0%
um representative if you could sure so
 
02:31:46.730 --> 02:31:46.740 align:start position:0%
the ones that I would bring up would be
 
02:31:48.889 --> 02:31:48.899 align:start position:0%
palliative care imagine somebody at home
 
02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know under palliative care need an
 
02:31:53.150 --> 02:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
opioids or any other medications imagine
 
02:31:56.450 --> 02:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
the Adolescent at home with ADHD that is
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
on Adderall they don't have to interrupt
 
02:31:59.929 --> 02:31:59.939 align:start position:0%
a full day of school or work for the mom
 
02:32:01.370 --> 02:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
or dad they could actually have a
 
02:32:03.290 --> 02:32:03.300 align:start position:0%
Telehealth visit with Mom or Dad present
 
02:32:04.610 --> 02:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
with them
 
02:32:07.610 --> 02:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
um post-op pain changes as was mentioned
 
02:32:09.889 --> 02:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
by representative hacken Phillips you
 
02:32:11.690 --> 02:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
could send a patient home and they tell
 
02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
you because you could put drugs into
 
02:32:15.710 --> 02:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
their surgical sites that keep them
 
02:32:17.870 --> 02:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable for 48 hours but when they
 
02:32:19.610 --> 02:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
get discharged they then have an
 
02:32:22.010 --> 02:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
escalation of pain that can change
 
02:32:24.110 --> 02:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
from a personal experience I can't tell
 
02:32:25.550 --> 02:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
you how many times I would walk through
 
02:32:27.650 --> 02:32:27.660 align:start position:0%
an orthopedic you know waiting room
 
02:32:32.650 --> 02:32:32.660 align:start position:0%
tripping over wheelchairs crutches
 
02:32:35.630 --> 02:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
Walkers even having patients come from
 
02:32:37.969 --> 02:32:37.979 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes on on
 
02:32:40.490 --> 02:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
um on Gurney's through with a uh through
 
02:32:42.610 --> 02:32:42.620 align:start position:0%
an ambulance which is very costly
 
02:32:44.750 --> 02:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
they don't have to come to the hospital
 
02:32:46.849 --> 02:32:46.859 align:start position:0%
to have this taken care of we can
 
02:32:48.410 --> 02:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
schedule all of these drugs via
 
02:32:50.929 --> 02:32:50.939 align:start position:0%
Telehealth and I think it would be very
 
02:32:53.290 --> 02:32:53.300 align:start position:0%
very helpful this is a basically a
 
02:32:56.030 --> 02:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
patient-centered caring bill and I would
 
02:32:58.010 --> 02:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
support this Bill thank you thank you
 
02:33:01.130 --> 02:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
questions representative Weber
 
02:33:04.849 --> 02:33:04.859 align:start position:0%
thank you so to summarize wouldn't it
 
02:33:07.250 --> 02:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
be fair to say
 
02:33:11.570 --> 02:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
that what this bill does in the end is
 
02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
remove the restrictions that were the
 
02:33:19.010 --> 02:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
cost of passing any telemedicine bill at
 
02:33:22.429 --> 02:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
all back prior to the pandemic because
 
02:33:26.090 --> 02:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
we now know that we can do it we can do
 
02:33:28.510 --> 02:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
it safely and it provides much better
 
02:33:32.750 --> 02:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
patient care and patient access so the
 
02:33:35.570 --> 02:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
barriers that were created as the price
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
of getting any telemedicine started are
 
02:33:40.730 --> 02:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
now not necessary because of our
 
02:33:43.010 --> 02:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
experience with it I couldn't have said
 
02:33:44.690 --> 02:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
it any better when else do we ever have
 
02:33:46.849 --> 02:33:46.859 align:start position:0%
a clinical trial that precedes the
 
02:33:49.969 --> 02:33:49.979 align:start position:0%
institution of a policy thank you
 
02:33:51.650 --> 02:33:51.660 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:33:54.290 --> 02:33:54.300 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
02:33:54.300 --> 02:33:55.730 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
chairman

02:33:55.730 --> 02:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:33:55.740 --> 02:33:56.330 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

02:33:56.330 --> 02:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
I'm hung up on the language about
 
02:34:01.849 --> 02:34:01.859 align:start position:0%
methadone okay and early in the um early
 
02:34:04.010 --> 02:34:04.020 align:start position:0%
in the pandemic we actually passed a
 
02:34:07.250 --> 02:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
Telehealth bill which was um focused
 
02:34:10.750 --> 02:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
part of it was focused on um enhancing
 
02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
mat medically assisted treatment in um
 
02:34:18.230 --> 02:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
underserved areas in the doorways and
 
02:34:20.750 --> 02:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
specifically in in jails where there had
 
02:34:22.969 --> 02:34:22.979 align:start position:0%
been a court case where that that people
 
02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
were entitled to get that kind of
 
02:34:27.050 --> 02:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
treatment in jails so we passed a bill
 
02:34:27.060 --> 02:34:29.389 align:start position:0%
treatment in jails so we passed a bill
allowing

02:34:29.389 --> 02:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
02:34:31.849 --> 02:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
um those medications to be prescribed to
 
02:34:33.950 --> 02:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
tell you the truth I'm not absolutely
 
02:34:36.530 --> 02:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
certain that if if methadone was
 
02:34:38.270 --> 02:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
included or if it was just Suboxone
 
02:34:40.969 --> 02:34:40.979 align:start position:0%
maybe there's somebody else here who who
 
02:34:42.650 --> 02:34:42.660 align:start position:0%
knows the answer you took the words out
 
02:34:44.809 --> 02:34:44.819 align:start position:0%
of my mouth representative but
 
02:34:47.030 --> 02:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
maybe you know the answer but I might
 
02:34:50.690 --> 02:34:50.700 align:start position:0%
but my question is this bill
 
02:34:50.700 --> 02:34:52.190 align:start position:0%
but my question is this bill
you

02:34:52.190 --> 02:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:34:55.010 --> 02:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
I assume that you wouldn't want to do
 
02:34:57.349 --> 02:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
anything to
 
02:35:00.290 --> 02:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
um to limit those kinds of services for
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
people and I assume that this bill is
 
02:35:04.370 --> 02:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
not intending to do that is that true
 
02:35:06.950 --> 02:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's true and I would I would defer to
 
02:35:09.050 --> 02:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
the folks from DH who deal with that
 
02:35:11.150 --> 02:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
much more than I do about exactly how to
 
02:35:12.710 --> 02:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
manage that going forward
 
02:35:14.210 --> 02:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:35:17.389 --> 02:35:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:17.399 --> 02:35:18.849 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:35:18.849 --> 02:35:18.859 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:35:23.929 --> 02:35:23.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:26.030 --> 02:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for you
 
02:35:28.190 --> 02:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
made me feel a lot better
 
02:35:30.530 --> 02:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
um with one exception
 
02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
um and I'm curious about I I still have
 
02:35:35.690 --> 02:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
to get back to the methadone restriction
 
02:35:38.389 --> 02:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
um in pain management methadone is an
 
02:35:40.429 --> 02:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
awesome drug for refractory neuropathic
 
02:35:44.030 --> 02:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
pain it certainly has a lot of limits
 
02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:44.870 align:start position:0%
pain it certainly has a lot of limits
um

02:35:44.870 --> 02:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:46.730 --> 02:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
um a lot of our patients live a long
 
02:35:48.889 --> 02:35:48.899 align:start position:0%
distance from where we go you don't need
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
to be in one of those settings to
 
02:35:52.670 --> 02:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
prescribe it for pain but you need a lot
 
02:35:55.849 --> 02:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
of expertise with an established patient
 
02:35:57.290 --> 02:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
I would still want to be able to
 
02:35:59.570 --> 02:35:59.580 align:start position:0%
prescribe that by telemedicine and I'm
 
02:36:01.370 --> 02:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
concerned that this bill takes that out
 
02:36:03.110 --> 02:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
and I agree with you and I don't
 
02:36:05.450 --> 02:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
disagree with the the your intention
 
02:36:06.950 --> 02:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:36:09.230 --> 02:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
um but I think that was actually carried
 
02:36:10.849 --> 02:36:10.859 align:start position:0%
forward from the previous statute but I
 
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
can leave that to again Mr hood and
 
02:36:15.590 --> 02:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
folks from DH to try to explain that
 
02:36:17.630 --> 02:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
better and any remedies for this going
 
02:36:19.370 --> 02:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
forward because I agree with you
 
02:36:21.770 --> 02:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly thanks yeah other
 
02:36:21.780 --> 02:36:24.370 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly thanks yeah other
questions

02:36:24.370 --> 02:36:24.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:27.170 --> 02:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions okay thank you
 
02:36:30.110 --> 02:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
I have one editorial comment on the side
 
02:36:33.469 --> 02:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
I am I hear about the patient's
 
02:36:35.210 --> 02:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
disappointment with Medical Care in
 
02:36:37.730 --> 02:36:37.740 align:start position:0%
general I agree with that the sentiment
 
02:36:39.710 --> 02:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
that I hear it regularly but I would
 
02:36:41.330 --> 02:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
argue that we have a health we do not
 
02:36:42.770 --> 02:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
have a health care crisis in this
 
02:36:44.809 --> 02:36:44.819 align:start position:0%
country or in the state we have a health
 
02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
care access and Administration crisis
 
02:36:49.849 --> 02:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
and so I I honestly when I push back a
 
02:36:52.250 --> 02:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
little bit because providers in this
 
02:36:54.590 --> 02:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
state give us the best care possible
 
02:36:57.950 --> 02:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
they are sometimes hackled by outside
 
02:36:59.929 --> 02:36:59.939 align:start position:0%
forces that we can't contribute which
 
02:37:01.730 --> 02:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
trickle down to Patient sentiment
 
02:37:04.010 --> 02:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
regarding the profession thank you thank
 
02:37:04.020 --> 02:37:07.490 align:start position:0%
regarding the profession thank you thank
you

02:37:07.490 --> 02:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:09.950 --> 02:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
okay also signed up to testify is
 
02:37:16.809 --> 02:37:16.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:23.170 --> 02:37:23.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:26.090 --> 02:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
Matthew Hood okay sure if you want to
 
02:37:27.710 --> 02:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
votes come up that's fine
 
02:37:31.070 --> 02:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
yeah okay sure go ahead I was just
 
02:37:32.570 --> 02:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
saying like I'll speak to the corporate
 
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
perspective of that representative
 
02:37:36.170 --> 02:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
Dayton was concerned about uh Dr
 
02:37:37.730 --> 02:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
McMurray can speak to the patient and
 
02:37:39.170 --> 02:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
provider perspective I think yeah I
 
02:37:40.849 --> 02:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
think you both asked for five minutes uh
 
02:37:42.770 --> 02:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
if you can shorten that a bit uh each
 
02:37:46.490 --> 02:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:48.590 --> 02:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
02:37:50.990 --> 02:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
Matthew Hood vice president of
 
02:37:52.309 --> 02:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
government relations at Dartmouth Health
 
02:37:56.030 --> 02:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh pleased to be here today I think
 
02:37:58.370 --> 02:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
um representative Murphy answered a
 
02:37:59.809 --> 02:37:59.819 align:start position:0%
number of the questions that were raised
 
02:38:01.610 --> 02:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
in the first go-around
 
02:38:04.790 --> 02:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
um so I will just acknowledge that this
 
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
committee has heard a number of bills uh
 
02:38:10.010 --> 02:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
over the past number of sessions with
 
02:38:12.410 --> 02:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
respect to Telehealth generally as well
 
02:38:14.450 --> 02:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
as Telehealth prescribing in particular
 
02:38:15.710 --> 02:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to thank you for your
 
02:38:17.330 --> 02:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
taking the lead the legislature for
 
02:38:21.530 --> 02:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
taking the lead in the sud space
 
02:38:24.170 --> 02:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
what the what the law currently provides
 
02:38:27.050 --> 02:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
is that providers cannot prescribe
 
02:38:29.150 --> 02:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
schedule two through schedule four drugs
 
02:38:32.690 --> 02:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
via telemedicine with the exception of
 
02:38:34.250 --> 02:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
sud treatment
 
02:38:36.170 --> 02:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
carved out of that exception is
 
02:38:38.450 --> 02:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
methadone we have not changed that
 
02:38:38.460 --> 02:38:40.250 align:start position:0%
methadone we have not changed that
provision

02:38:40.250 --> 02:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
provision
 
02:38:43.010 --> 02:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
not for any intentional intentionality
 
02:38:45.349 --> 02:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
to carve that out it's already been
 
02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
excluded Dartmouth health does not
 
02:38:50.210 --> 02:38:50.220 align:start position:0%
provide methadone services in our
 
02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
through our doorway but we're not
 
02:38:54.290 --> 02:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
opposed to that unless from a very
 
02:38:55.969 --> 02:38:55.979 align:start position:0%
pragmatic perspective representative
 
02:38:57.410 --> 02:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
it's going to kill the bill in which
 
02:38:59.450 --> 02:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
case I would be opposed to to carving
 
02:39:00.309 --> 02:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
that out
 
02:39:02.690 --> 02:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
02:39:04.610 --> 02:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
the during the pandemic the
 
02:39:07.010 --> 02:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
administrative arms acted as well right
 
02:39:09.050 --> 02:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
so on the state level there was an
 
02:39:11.929 --> 02:39:11.939 align:start position:0%
emergency order that enabled the
 
02:39:13.969 --> 02:39:13.979 align:start position:0%
provision of Health Care via Telehealth
 
02:39:15.530 --> 02:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
all modes of health care which included
 
02:39:17.690 --> 02:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
prescribing that has expired that's
 
02:39:20.590 --> 02:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
going away you also had the Federal
 
02:39:23.090 --> 02:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
Public Health Emergency that enabled
 
02:39:25.070 --> 02:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
flexibilities that has been noted before
 
02:39:27.230 --> 02:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
is going to go away May 11th so what
 
02:39:29.150 --> 02:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
this bill does
 
02:39:31.309 --> 02:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
I view it as enabling the flexibilities
 
02:39:33.050 --> 02:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
that the public health emergencies
 
02:39:35.510 --> 02:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
provided with respect to Telehealth in
 
02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:36.469 align:start position:0%
provided with respect to Telehealth in
general

02:39:36.469 --> 02:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
general
 
02:39:38.510 --> 02:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
and prescribing via Telehealth in
 
02:39:38.520 --> 02:39:40.370 align:start position:0%
and prescribing via Telehealth in
particular

02:39:40.370 --> 02:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:39:40.380 --> 02:39:41.389 align:start position:0%
particular
um

02:39:41.389 --> 02:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:44.450 --> 02:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
there are a range of healthcare services
 
02:39:48.170 --> 02:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
that would be impacted by this
 
02:39:50.809 --> 02:39:50.819 align:start position:0%
the utilization of prescribing via
 
02:39:53.330 --> 02:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
Telehealth and keep in mind medications
 
02:39:55.370 --> 02:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
for many of these health conditions are
 
02:39:57.410 --> 02:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
controlled substances regulated by the
 
02:40:00.830 --> 02:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
DEA that's what we're talking about so I
 
02:40:02.389 --> 02:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
think representative Murphy talked about
 
02:40:04.990 --> 02:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
schedule two stimulants for ADHD
 
02:40:08.389 --> 02:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
behavioral health issues were raised Dr
 
02:40:09.950 --> 02:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
McMartin is going to speak to palliative
 
02:40:12.290 --> 02:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
care and oncology space I think
 
02:40:14.530 --> 02:40:14.540 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy in personal
 
02:40:16.610 --> 02:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
experience in post-surgical pain
 
02:40:19.910 --> 02:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
management has raised that as well
 
02:40:22.250 --> 02:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
we know Telehealth is an effective mode
 
02:40:24.410 --> 02:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
of care delivery it's also an essential
 
02:40:24.420 --> 02:40:25.610 align:start position:0%
of care delivery it's also an essential
tool

02:40:25.610 --> 02:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
tool
 
02:40:27.530 --> 02:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
to address the current imbalance between
 
02:40:30.950 --> 02:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:33.170 --> 02:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
moreover IT addresses the inequity of
 
02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
care options in a rural region frankly
 
02:40:36.710 --> 02:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
it's a whole lot harder to get to an
 
02:40:38.270 --> 02:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
in-person visit in Northern New England
 
02:40:39.889 --> 02:40:39.899 align:start position:0%
than it is to get to a visit via
 
02:40:41.450 --> 02:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
Telehealth we've seen that through the
 
02:40:43.070 --> 02:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic and we've seen patient
 
02:40:44.929 --> 02:40:44.939 align:start position:0%
preference for the continuation of
 
02:40:44.939 --> 02:40:47.330 align:start position:0%
preference for the continuation of
Telehealth

02:40:47.330 --> 02:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
Telehealth
 
02:40:49.910 --> 02:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
in closing of my portion I would just
 
02:40:52.910 --> 02:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
note three additional pieces I think
 
02:40:54.370 --> 02:40:54.380 align:start position:0%
actually and I wanted to thank
 
02:40:56.270 --> 02:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
representative hacken Phillips for
 
02:40:58.730 --> 02:40:58.740 align:start position:0%
introducing the legislation the laws of
 
02:41:00.530 --> 02:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
the states that surround us Maine
 
02:41:02.750 --> 02:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Vermont enable
 
02:41:04.849 --> 02:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
prescribing via Telehealth if licensed
 
02:41:08.090 --> 02:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
then in the state and DEA registered the
 
02:41:11.150 --> 02:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
DEA is set to prescribe issue Guidance
 
02:41:12.650 --> 02:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
with respect to prescribing both in the
 
02:41:14.750 --> 02:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
sud space and in Telehealth prescribing
 
02:41:17.090 --> 02:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
in general if we want to take advantage
 
02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
of we expect those to be flexibilities
 
02:41:20.690 --> 02:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
our state law has to accommodate that
 
02:41:22.130 --> 02:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
too because you have to go to the most
 
02:41:24.170 --> 02:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
restrictive law
 
02:41:26.210 --> 02:41:26.220 align:start position:0%
and finally safeguards and I'm going to
 
02:41:29.510 --> 02:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
leave behind a piece for you uh are a
 
02:41:32.330 --> 02:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
new that exists with respect to opioid
 
02:41:34.610 --> 02:41:34.620 align:start position:0%
prescribing concerns generally
 
02:41:37.849 --> 02:41:37.859 align:start position:0%
remain in the prescribing via Telehealth
 
02:41:39.410 --> 02:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
space and you'll see the list of
 
02:41:41.030 --> 02:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
safeguards that exist or I'm happy to
 
02:41:42.290 --> 02:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
speak to them with their questions thank
 
02:41:43.849 --> 02:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chairman members of the
 
02:41:46.910 --> 02:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
committee thank you do you want to both
 
02:41:49.010 --> 02:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
speak and then we'll I defer to you of
 
02:41:50.809 --> 02:41:50.819 align:start position:0%
course Mr chair uh why don't you go
 
02:41:52.790 --> 02:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
ahead doctor and then we'll we'll take
 
02:41:55.090 --> 02:41:55.100 align:start position:0%
questions from for both of you thank you
 
02:41:57.710 --> 02:41:57.720 align:start position:0%

palliative care team and our patients
 
02:42:16.670 --> 02:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
and their families in support of this
 
02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:17.870 align:start position:0%
and their families in support of this
bill

02:42:17.870 --> 02:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:42:19.670 --> 02:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
for those who may not be familiar with
 
02:42:21.050 --> 02:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
it palliative care is a medical
 
02:42:23.090 --> 02:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
specialty focused on improving the
 
02:42:24.770 --> 02:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
quality of life for patients with
 
02:42:27.230 --> 02:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
serious or life-limiting illness and
 
02:42:29.270 --> 02:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
their families and Care Partners
 
02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
our interdisciplinary team provides
 
02:42:32.929 --> 02:42:32.939 align:start position:0%
support with care planning medical
 
02:42:35.690 --> 02:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
decision making navigating the emotional
 
02:42:37.070 --> 02:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
challenges that come with serious
 
02:42:38.929 --> 02:42:38.939 align:start position:0%
illness and often the prescribing of
 
02:42:41.330 --> 02:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
medications such as opioids to relieve
 
02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
the physical suffering from Pain and
 
02:42:44.690 --> 02:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
other symptoms
 
02:42:46.309 --> 02:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the covid-19
 
02:42:48.830 --> 02:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic and Public Health Emergency our
 
02:42:50.750 --> 02:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
Outpatient Clinic converted nearly
 
02:42:53.210 --> 02:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
overnight to a primarily Telehealth
 
02:42:53.220 --> 02:42:53.929 align:start position:0%
overnight to a primarily Telehealth
model

02:42:53.929 --> 02:42:53.939 align:start position:0%
model
 
02:42:55.849 --> 02:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
a significant proportion of our
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
outpatients continue to receive their
 
02:43:00.650 --> 02:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
Care by Telehealth by their own choice
 
02:43:02.809 --> 02:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
for our team we want to be able to
 
02:43:04.670 --> 02:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
prescribe control Controlled Substances
 
02:43:06.889 --> 02:43:06.899 align:start position:0%
to patients like ours as a matter of
 
02:43:09.889 --> 02:43:09.899 align:start position:0%
equity and patient choice
 
02:43:12.170 --> 02:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
to speak to the matter of equity we know
 
02:43:13.790 --> 02:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
that rural residents have far less
 
02:43:15.650 --> 02:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
Access to Health Care in general than
 
02:43:17.630 --> 02:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
Urban residents and palliative care is
 
02:43:19.849 --> 02:43:19.859 align:start position:0%
unfortunately no exception to this
 
02:43:21.770 --> 02:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
during the public health emergency we
 
02:43:23.750 --> 02:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
were able to provide care including the
 
02:43:26.030 --> 02:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
prescribing of necessary medications for
 
02:43:27.830 --> 02:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
patients who are too sick to travel long
 
02:43:29.809 --> 02:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
distances safely or who are unable to
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
get transportation for a variety of
 
02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:32.809 align:start position:0%
get transportation for a variety of
reasons

02:43:32.809 --> 02:43:32.819 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
02:43:34.969 --> 02:43:34.979 align:start position:0%
we surveyed Telehealth patients in our
 
02:43:36.590 --> 02:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
clinic and found that on average our
 
02:43:38.809 --> 02:43:38.819 align:start position:0%
patients drive 70 miles round trip to
 
02:43:41.150 --> 02:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
get care with us that's the average
 
02:43:43.610 --> 02:43:43.620 align:start position:0%
and many identified the cost of travel
 
02:43:45.590 --> 02:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
and the logistics of Transportation as
 
02:43:48.170 --> 02:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
major barriers to in-person visits
 
02:43:50.210 --> 02:43:50.220 align:start position:0%
as an example consider one of our real
 
02:43:52.610 --> 02:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
patients who has end stage emphysema and

metastatic lung cancer she requires
 
02:43:57.469 --> 02:43:57.479 align:start position:0%
intensive and high-level respiratory
 
02:43:59.870 --> 02:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
support to help her lungs function and
 
02:44:01.969 --> 02:44:01.979 align:start position:0%
has extensive painful tumors throughout
 
02:44:03.110 --> 02:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
her bones
 
02:44:05.210 --> 02:44:05.220 align:start position:0%
during the public health emergency our
 
02:44:07.250 --> 02:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
team prescribed opioids to safely and
 
02:44:08.870 --> 02:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
effectively manage her pain and
 
02:44:11.090 --> 02:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
shortness of breath because of the
 
02:44:12.950 --> 02:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
severity of her lung condition traveling
 
02:44:14.570 --> 02:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
quite distances is actually quite
 
02:44:16.670 --> 02:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
dangerous for her and she's currently
 
02:44:18.469 --> 02:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
without someone locally who can continue
 
02:44:20.929 --> 02:44:20.939 align:start position:0%
these prescriptions she lives 90 minutes
 
02:44:22.790 --> 02:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
away from our clinic and she is
 
02:44:22.800 --> 02:44:23.870 align:start position:0%
away from our clinic and she is
suffering

02:44:23.870 --> 02:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
suffering
 
02:44:25.670 --> 02:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
we believe that all patients with
 
02:44:27.950 --> 02:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
serious illness deserve access to the
 
02:44:29.690 --> 02:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
high quality medical care that's more
 
02:44:31.490 --> 02:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
readily available to patients who live
 
02:44:33.710 --> 02:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
in bigger population centers who are
 
02:44:35.389 --> 02:44:35.399 align:start position:0%
financially secure and otherwise
 
02:44:35.399 --> 02:44:37.309 align:start position:0%
financially secure and otherwise
well-resourced

02:44:37.309 --> 02:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
well-resourced
 
02:44:39.530 --> 02:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
regarding the matter of patient choice I
 
02:44:41.030 --> 02:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
think our state's reputation for
 
02:44:43.030 --> 02:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
individual autonomy speaks for itself
 
02:44:45.349 --> 02:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
palliative care is a specialty which
 
02:44:46.969 --> 02:44:46.979 align:start position:0%
puts the goals and values of each
 
02:44:49.790 --> 02:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
patient at the very center of our work
 
02:44:51.290 --> 02:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
we believe that patients should get
 
02:44:53.450 --> 02:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
medical care that is consistent with
 
02:44:55.250 --> 02:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
those goals and values whether it's
 
02:44:57.050 --> 02:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
aimed at Living longer maintaining
 
02:44:58.910 --> 02:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
physical function or focusing on the
 
02:45:01.190 --> 02:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
quality of their life it became clear to
 
02:45:02.510 --> 02:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
US during the public health emergency
 
02:45:04.370 --> 02:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
that allowing patients to receive
 
02:45:06.110 --> 02:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
palliative care in the manner of their
 
02:45:08.330 --> 02:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
choosing was a powerful way to honor
 
02:45:11.090 --> 02:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
patient choice and autonomy in our
 
02:45:12.650 --> 02:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
survey of palliative care outpatients
 
02:45:14.510 --> 02:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
more than half expressed a preference to
 
02:45:16.250 --> 02:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
continue to receive palliative care by
 
02:45:18.530 --> 02:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
Telehealth in a state which values
 
02:45:20.330 --> 02:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
individual choice We believe that
 
02:45:21.710 --> 02:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
patients in their medical team should
 
02:45:23.750 --> 02:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
have all the possible tools available to
 
02:45:25.490 --> 02:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
them so that they may decide for
 
02:45:27.170 --> 02:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
themselves how best to receive medical
 
02:45:29.090 --> 02:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
treatment whether it's palliative care
 
02:45:31.969 --> 02:45:31.979 align:start position:0%
or has been discussed by others Cancer
 
02:45:33.590 --> 02:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
Care treatment of behavioral health
 
02:45:35.870 --> 02:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
issues or post-operative care
 
02:45:37.670 --> 02:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
in summary our section of palliative
 
02:45:40.250 --> 02:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
medicine at dhmc is in full support of
 
02:45:42.050 --> 02:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
this bill as a way to help ensure that
 
02:45:43.790 --> 02:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
the sickest and most vulnerable of our
 
02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
neighbors and patients are able to
 
02:45:47.330 --> 02:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
access medical care that is consistent
 
02:45:49.370 --> 02:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
with their values and alleviates their
 
02:45:51.349 --> 02:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
suffering thank you very much for the
 
02:45:53.990 --> 02:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak on about this bill
 
02:45:56.210 --> 02:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
and happy to answer questions thank you
 
02:45:59.630 --> 02:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
questions representative Weber
 
02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you Mr chair and
 
02:46:02.990 --> 02:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you both for being here and
 
02:46:06.110 --> 02:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:08.750 --> 02:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
former representative Hood
 
02:46:08.760 --> 02:46:09.410 align:start position:0%
former representative Hood
um

02:46:09.410 --> 02:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:12.290 --> 02:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
as a matter of drafting
 
02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
is there any are we creating any
 
02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:17.570 align:start position:0%
is there any are we creating any
problems

02:46:17.570 --> 02:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
problems
 
02:46:21.469 --> 02:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
other than issues of political will if
 
02:46:26.150 --> 02:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:28.849 --> 02:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
exception because
 
02:46:31.490 --> 02:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
if there's no reason to keep the method
 
02:46:33.410 --> 02:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
on exception in there and we've heard
 
02:46:35.150 --> 02:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
several people say it might be nice to
 
02:46:36.650 --> 02:46:36.660 align:start position:0%
get it out of there
 
02:46:40.330 --> 02:46:40.340 align:start position:0%
uh then one might be able to also
 
02:46:42.770 --> 02:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
eliminate one section of the bill and
 
02:46:46.250 --> 02:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
instead of saying uh it shall be illegal
 
02:46:48.050 --> 02:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
except for that which is illegal except
 
02:46:49.730 --> 02:46:49.740 align:start position:0%
for this thing which is still illegal
 
02:46:52.370 --> 02:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
which is really clunky drafting then
 
02:46:55.790 --> 02:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
then we could actually say it shall be
 
02:46:58.910 --> 02:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
legal to prescribe and because we got
 
02:47:00.830 --> 02:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
here because we had to put the
 
02:47:03.170 --> 02:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
provisions in in order to get anything
 
02:47:07.550 --> 02:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
passed so is it okay to take out the
 
02:47:08.929 --> 02:47:08.939 align:start position:0%
method on
 
02:47:12.590 --> 02:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
special treatment and let that simply be
 
02:47:15.590 --> 02:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
covered by whatever the DEA requires or
 
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
are we creating more problems for
 
02:47:19.730 --> 02:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
ourselves by taking it out than leaving
 
02:47:21.710 --> 02:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
it in so thank you for the question
 
02:47:24.110 --> 02:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative I would reiterate my
 
02:47:27.050 --> 02:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
first answer which is that yes it would
 
02:47:31.250 --> 02:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
be more neat neater to remove an
 
02:47:32.809 --> 02:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
exception from an exception
 
02:47:35.950 --> 02:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
that makes sense that being said
 
02:47:38.510 --> 02:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have a position we Dartmouth
 
02:47:40.010 --> 02:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
Health don't have a position on this
 
02:47:42.290 --> 02:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
provision we kept it as it was in the
 
02:47:44.690 --> 02:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
current statute my objection would be
 
02:47:46.010 --> 02:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
the political one
 
02:47:47.809 --> 02:47:47.819 align:start position:0%
um and so I would just reiterate that
 
02:47:49.790 --> 02:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:47:51.370 --> 02:47:51.380 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:47:54.050 --> 02:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
02:47:56.590 --> 02:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
how to tell which hands
 
02:47:58.790 --> 02:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:48:01.730 --> 02:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking the question
 
02:48:04.429 --> 02:48:04.439 align:start position:0%
the way I read it right now the
 
02:48:07.429 --> 02:48:07.439 align:start position:0%
physician can prescribed schedules two
 
02:48:08.870 --> 02:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
through four as long as they're not an
 
02:48:08.880 --> 02:48:10.070 align:start position:0%
through four as long as they're not an
opiate

02:48:10.070 --> 02:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
opiate
 
02:48:12.110 --> 02:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
according to the statute number two by
 
02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:13.610 align:start position:0%
according to the statute number two by
May

02:48:13.610 --> 02:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
May
 
02:48:15.290 --> 02:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
um would you again
 
02:48:17.450 --> 02:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
given the fact that there's a 34-day
 
02:48:19.849 --> 02:48:19.859 align:start position:0%
limit on a controlled drug today that
 
02:48:21.710 --> 02:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
does limit as far as any kind of abuse
 
02:48:25.730 --> 02:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
potential in three with methadone
 
02:48:27.530 --> 02:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
I know you politically were just where
 
02:48:29.090 --> 02:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
you're going uh representative or
 
02:48:32.929 --> 02:48:32.939 align:start position:0%
honorable but Senator Matthew thank you
 
02:48:34.849 --> 02:48:34.859 align:start position:0%
okay is that
 
02:48:36.590 --> 02:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
haven't been in the world of Pharmacy
 
02:48:39.050 --> 02:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
and seeing patients travel several hours
 
02:48:41.990 --> 02:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
to get to a position for methadone
 
02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:43.309 align:start position:0%
to get to a position for methadone
treatments

02:48:43.309 --> 02:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
treatments
 
02:48:45.950 --> 02:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
um I know politically is probably a
 
02:48:48.110 --> 02:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
concern which I understand would you be
 
02:48:50.090 --> 02:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
opposed again to following the Federal
 
02:48:52.969 --> 02:48:52.979 align:start position:0%
Regulations which do allow
 
02:48:55.790 --> 02:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
for a patient who's an existing patient
 
02:48:58.670 --> 02:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
to have Telehealth visits
 
02:49:02.210 --> 02:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
sorry so I heard three questions I think
 
02:49:03.770 --> 02:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
I wanted to answer them correctly my
 
02:49:05.270 --> 02:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is that we're again
 
02:49:07.190 --> 02:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
talking about schedule two through four
 
02:49:09.710 --> 02:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
Controlled Substances both opioid-based
 
02:49:11.929 --> 02:49:11.939 align:start position:0%
and non-opioid-based according to this
 
02:49:13.670 --> 02:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
if I could if you go back and look at
 
02:49:16.550 --> 02:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
the statute which you referenced here
 
02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:17.210 align:start position:0%
the statute which you referenced here
um

02:49:17.210 --> 02:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:21.469 --> 02:49:21.479 align:start position:0%
329 1D 3.
 
02:49:23.570 --> 02:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
prescribing of non-opiate control
 
02:49:26.090 --> 02:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
classified drugs schedule three through
 
02:49:27.830 --> 02:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
four by me to Telehealth shall be
 
02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:29.630 align:start position:0%
four by me to Telehealth shall be
limited

02:49:29.630 --> 02:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
limited
 
02:49:32.150 --> 02:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
to those prescribers so what we're
 
02:49:34.550 --> 02:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
trying to do really is add the opiates
 
02:49:38.630 --> 02:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
but but I'm sorry but can I so
 
02:49:40.090 --> 02:49:40.100 align:start position:0%
I view
 
02:49:43.070 --> 02:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
Roman 4 A1
 
02:49:44.870 --> 02:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
the prescribing of a non-opioid control
 
02:49:46.250 --> 02:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
drug classified in schedule two through
 
02:49:47.870 --> 02:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
four by means of telemedicine shall be
 
02:49:50.630 --> 02:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
limited to prescribers as defined
 
02:49:53.150 --> 02:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
section B1 the prescribing of an opioid
 
02:49:54.710 --> 02:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
control drug classified in schedule two
 
02:49:56.090 --> 02:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
through four by means of telemedicine
 
02:49:57.770 --> 02:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
shall be limited to prescribers
 
02:50:00.349 --> 02:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
I think it's both I'm not sure we're
 
02:50:01.969 --> 02:50:01.979 align:start position:0%
disagreeing here
 
02:50:04.370 --> 02:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
um to the point it's an artfully done in
 
02:50:06.050 --> 02:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
the statute and then it listed twice but
 
02:50:08.210 --> 02:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
I think the point I'm trying to make is
 
02:50:10.330 --> 02:50:10.340 align:start position:0%
that right now
 
02:50:13.250 --> 02:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
positions or any prescriber can actually
 
02:50:15.050 --> 02:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
prescribe two through four for
 
02:50:16.790 --> 02:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
non-opiate drugs all we're trying to do
 
02:50:18.889 --> 02:50:18.899 align:start position:0%
is add the opiates
 
02:50:22.190 --> 02:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
yeah um I'll tell you I'd have to
 
02:50:24.110 --> 02:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
confirm while I'm having a conversation
 
02:50:25.910 --> 02:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
trying to help I'm trying to help on the
 
02:50:27.710 --> 02:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
political side that we already allow for
 
02:50:29.450 --> 02:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
it we're just trying to take a certain
 
02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
class of drugs within the substance
 
02:50:34.790 --> 02:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
tweet two and four we're just trying to
 
02:50:38.210 --> 02:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
include it comprehensively yeah the idea
 
02:50:40.969 --> 02:50:40.979 align:start position:0%
is to expand it to both opioid base and
 
02:50:42.590 --> 02:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
non-opioid base which we may already
 
02:50:43.969 --> 02:50:43.979 align:start position:0%
will allow
 
02:50:45.710 --> 02:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
um for schedule two through four and
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
would you be opposed again if I try to
 
02:50:48.710 --> 02:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
work on the bill
 
02:50:52.309 --> 02:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
to amend it to allow for Methadone to be
 
02:50:53.870 --> 02:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
following the federal guidelines for
 
02:50:55.130 --> 02:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
State guidelines I'm just going to
 
02:50:56.389 --> 02:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
repeat what I've said and I'm not trying
 
02:50:58.490 --> 02:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
to be hard I just I'm not endorsing nor
 
02:51:03.230 --> 02:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
opposing to that um uh and finally no we
 
02:51:05.870 --> 02:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
have to comply with we have to comply
 
02:51:07.130 --> 02:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
with the stricter of the federal versus
 
02:51:09.290 --> 02:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
state law so I would have zero objection
 
02:51:11.469 --> 02:51:11.479 align:start position:0%
following DEA
 
02:51:13.969 --> 02:51:13.979 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
02:51:15.469 --> 02:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you both for being
 
02:51:15.479 --> 02:51:16.610 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you both for being
here

02:51:16.610 --> 02:51:16.620 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:51:18.170 --> 02:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
um I'm hoping you can help me with my
 
02:51:20.210 --> 02:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
confusion last year
 
02:51:22.250 --> 02:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
um the the it was signed in House Bill
 
02:51:25.130 --> 02:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
503 was signed into law which addressed
 
02:51:27.650 --> 02:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
prescribing prescribed prescriptions
 
02:51:30.230 --> 02:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
over Telehealth including opioids that
 
02:51:33.410 --> 02:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
removed a lot of different requirements
 
02:51:35.450 --> 02:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
about what face-to-face interaction was
 
02:51:39.490 --> 02:51:39.500 align:start position:0%
required and referred all of this to 329
 
02:51:44.750 --> 02:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
colon 1d1 and 326-b to
 
02:51:47.270 --> 02:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
12a basically that's saying that
 
02:51:49.849 --> 02:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
Telehealth is Telehealth and Physicians
 
02:51:51.230 --> 02:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
who are doing Telehealth can do
 
02:51:54.290 --> 02:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
Telehealth and the same for APR for
 
02:51:58.070 --> 02:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
advanced practice nurses right now I see
 
02:52:00.050 --> 02:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
in the statutes around the controlled
 
02:52:03.070 --> 02:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
Drug Act and prohibited acts that
 
02:52:03.080 --> 02:52:05.710 align:start position:0%
Drug Act and prohibited acts that
section

02:52:05.710 --> 02:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:52:08.389 --> 02:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
328-b216b permits the prescription
 
02:52:10.969 --> 02:52:10.979 align:start position:0%
through Telehealth of schedule two
 
02:52:13.969 --> 02:52:13.979 align:start position:0%
through four drugs and as I'm looking at
 
02:52:15.290 --> 02:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
this it looks like this was already
 
02:52:16.910 --> 02:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
addressed last year and I'm trying to
 
02:52:18.769 --> 02:52:18.779 align:start position:0%
understand why there's a problem right
 
02:52:21.230 --> 02:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
now for Dartmouth when in my eyes the
 
02:52:23.690 --> 02:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
statute's already reading as solving the
 
02:52:23.700 --> 02:52:25.370 align:start position:0%
statute's already reading as solving the
problem

02:52:25.370 --> 02:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:52:28.370 --> 02:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
see thank you for the question if if I
 
02:52:28.380 --> 02:52:29.929 align:start position:0%
see thank you for the question if if I
may

02:52:29.929 --> 02:52:29.939 align:start position:0%
may
 
02:52:31.910 --> 02:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
because the section that we're proposing
 
02:52:35.450 --> 02:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
be revised prohibits that so even if
 
02:52:37.630 --> 02:52:37.640 align:start position:0%
it's enabled in one section it prohibits
 
02:52:40.610 --> 02:52:40.620 align:start position:0%
prescribing via Telehealth schedule two
 
02:52:45.530 --> 02:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:47.090 --> 02:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
follow-up in my reading it's a section
 
02:52:49.429 --> 02:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
right directly below that that permits
 
02:52:50.929 --> 02:52:50.939 align:start position:0%
that there's the part that permits the
 
02:52:52.490 --> 02:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
the substance use disorder and then
 
02:52:57.410 --> 02:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:57.420 --> 02:52:59.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:52:59.150 --> 02:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:59.160 --> 02:53:01.250 align:start position:0%
um
that's

02:53:01.250 --> 02:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:53:02.750 --> 02:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
so if you actually go back to the
 
02:53:04.250 --> 02:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
controlled Drug Act that seems to be the
 
02:53:06.349 --> 02:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
one that prohibits it if we simply
 
02:53:08.630 --> 02:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
remove this the specific card at carve
 
02:53:11.090 --> 02:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
out for substance use disorders would
 
02:53:12.950 --> 02:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
that solve our problem in a much more
 
02:53:15.849 --> 02:53:15.859 align:start position:0%
elegant Way by removing the language
 
02:53:21.830 --> 02:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:24.110 --> 02:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to find
 
02:53:26.030 --> 02:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing there's nothing I
 
02:53:28.010 --> 02:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
can't find anything in the controlled
 
02:53:30.050 --> 02:53:30.060 align:start position:0%
Drug Act that limits the prescription of
 
02:53:32.809 --> 02:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
opioids and schedule two this opioids or
 
02:53:34.670 --> 02:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
non-opioids in schedule two through four
 
02:53:36.710 --> 02:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
that lemon said only to substance use
 
02:53:39.849 --> 02:53:39.859 align:start position:0%
disorder can I answer General
 
02:53:42.349 --> 02:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
I have a point of order for the chair or
 
02:53:44.769 --> 02:53:44.779 align:start position:0%
a question for the chair and that is
 
02:53:48.710 --> 02:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
because it sounds to me very much like
 
02:53:52.670 --> 02:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
all of us who have been speaking or
 
02:53:55.610 --> 02:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
trying to deal in the same way or trying
 
02:53:57.469 --> 02:53:57.479 align:start position:0%
to achieve the same end but we're trying
 
02:53:59.030 --> 02:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
to wrestle with a really mightily
 
02:54:02.570 --> 02:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
difficult drafting muddle uh based on
 
02:54:05.809 --> 02:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
historical drafting would this not be a
 
02:54:08.630 --> 02:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
bill that might Avail itself very well
 
02:54:10.370 --> 02:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
to the appointment of a subcommittee
 
02:54:13.090 --> 02:54:13.100 align:start position:0%
specifically to draft a proper Amendment
 
02:54:17.090 --> 02:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
or failing a subcommittee a small number
 
02:54:20.110 --> 02:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
of people to work with the folks from
 
02:54:23.750 --> 02:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health to draft
 
02:54:26.269 --> 02:54:26.279 align:start position:0%
cleaner language
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
if I'm if I'm understanding that we're
 
02:54:30.469 --> 02:54:30.479 align:start position:0%
all trying to provide the maximum
 
02:54:33.469 --> 02:54:33.479 align:start position:0%
flexibility yes representative Leon
 
02:54:35.510 --> 02:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you my statement is I think that
 
02:54:37.010 --> 02:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
this is already covered under law I
 
02:54:39.889 --> 02:54:39.899 align:start position:0%
don't know if we can find out if we can
 
02:54:41.570 --> 02:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
find out and get some information on
 
02:54:43.610 --> 02:54:43.620 align:start position:0%
that and then if it's necessary then we
 
02:54:45.230 --> 02:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
can look to a subcommittee or an ad talk
 
02:54:47.269 --> 02:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
but it in my reading I think it was
 
02:54:48.950 --> 02:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
addressed so I'd like to send this to
 
02:54:51.050 --> 02:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
the committee researcher just for advice
 
02:54:53.090 --> 02:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
if Mr chair if I could it's in my
 
02:54:56.150 --> 02:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse um represent a merchant thank
 
02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair the challenge here is that
 
02:55:00.769 --> 02:55:00.779 align:start position:0%
the federal law and the state law now
 
02:55:00.779 --> 02:55:01.910 align:start position:0%
the federal law and the state law now
conflict

02:55:01.910 --> 02:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
02:55:04.490 --> 02:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
and the federal law has become more
 
02:55:06.530 --> 02:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
lenient but the state law has not caught
 
02:55:07.910 --> 02:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
up with the federal law
 
02:55:09.530 --> 02:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
so a lot of things are referencing
 
02:55:12.410 --> 02:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
representatively on is in fact true
 
02:55:15.950 --> 02:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
based upon the state law but we need to
 
02:55:18.650 --> 02:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
fix the state law to allow for the
 
02:55:20.090 --> 02:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
flexibility the federal law does not
 
02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
allow for and that's kind of where we're
 
02:55:23.210 --> 02:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
caught into it a lot of times what
 
02:55:25.790 --> 02:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
happens is at least in the world of
 
02:55:28.670 --> 02:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy we have a tendency to put into
 
02:55:30.410 --> 02:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
state law what's at the federal level
 
02:55:32.809 --> 02:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is why we do that
 
02:55:35.150 --> 02:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
is that at the state level we cannot
 
02:55:36.889 --> 02:55:36.899 align:start position:0%
enforce federal law but we can enforce
 
02:55:39.050 --> 02:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
state law federal enforces federal law
 
02:55:41.210 --> 02:55:41.220 align:start position:0%
not state law so we have a tendency to
 
02:55:42.650 --> 02:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
mirror the two together but right now
 
02:55:45.769 --> 02:55:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:47.510 --> 02:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:48.530 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
uh

02:55:48.530 --> 02:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:55:50.510 --> 02:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
I'll just I'll remain confused and we
 
02:55:51.950 --> 02:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
can discuss this later at some point
 
02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:54.410 align:start position:0%
can discuss this later at some point
okay

02:55:54.410 --> 02:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:55:56.450 --> 02:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion uh any other
 
02:55:59.030 --> 02:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
questions for these two folks
 
02:56:01.370 --> 02:56:01.380 align:start position:0%
I am seeing none
 
02:56:06.830 --> 02:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:08.809 --> 02:56:08.819 align:start position:0%
the final person who has signed up to
 
02:56:12.290 --> 02:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
testify uh on this bill is Jim Monahan
 
02:56:18.290 --> 02:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:20.030 --> 02:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:56:21.830 --> 02:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this is my first
 
02:56:25.429 --> 02:56:25.439 align:start position:0%
trip to HHS this year so good morning I
 
02:56:26.750 --> 02:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
think in fact the last time I was here I
 
02:56:28.670 --> 02:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
worked with representative Leon on 503
 
02:56:30.290 --> 02:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
so I'll address that a bit if that's
 
02:56:32.510 --> 02:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
okay but I am here today I have a number
 
02:56:34.370 --> 02:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
of clients that are impacted by this
 
02:56:35.809 --> 02:56:35.819 align:start position:0%
bill and I wanted to come to the public
 
02:56:38.150 --> 02:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
hearing uh to hear a little more words
 
02:56:41.030 --> 02:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
coming home so the pink card I turned in
 
02:56:43.969 --> 02:56:43.979 align:start position:0%
does Chekhov support but I do think we
 
02:56:46.550 --> 02:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
want to get it right because of the
 
02:56:47.929 --> 02:56:47.939 align:start position:0%
um because we want to get it right and I
 
02:56:49.550 --> 02:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
have at least three clients that are
 
02:56:51.290 --> 02:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
impacted by this uh that would include
 
02:56:53.330 --> 02:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
the Community Mental Health Centers
 
02:56:55.670 --> 02:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
which are involved in the prescribing of
 
02:56:57.830 --> 02:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
schedule two through four for mental
 
02:56:59.570 --> 02:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
health conditions
 
02:57:02.809 --> 02:57:02.819 align:start position:0%
um as well as the advance registered
 
02:57:04.670 --> 02:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners section two of the
 
02:57:07.429 --> 02:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
bill opens up their statute and then I
 
02:57:10.490 --> 02:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
also represent the um the opioid
 
02:57:12.590 --> 02:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
treatment programs which are the
 
02:57:14.150 --> 02:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
methadone clinics in New Hampshire where
 
02:57:17.510 --> 02:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
most of the uh the methadone-ish most of
 
02:57:19.730 --> 02:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
the use of methadone probably takes
 
02:57:19.740 --> 02:57:20.570 align:start position:0%
the use of methadone probably takes
place

02:57:20.570 --> 02:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:57:24.290 --> 02:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
so uh I understand it's that there's
 
02:57:26.150 --> 02:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
some confusion over the language and a
 
02:57:30.469 --> 02:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
lot of it is the the need to align uh uh
 
02:57:32.389 --> 02:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
State statutes uh with the federal
 
02:57:35.269 --> 02:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
statutes uh and as representative
 
02:57:37.910 --> 02:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
Merchant observed those are changing and
 
02:57:40.550 --> 02:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
becoming more lenient probably on a
 
02:57:42.469 --> 02:57:42.479 align:start position:0%
different piece of legislation we should
 
02:57:44.630 --> 02:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
deal with that alignment um but I want
 
02:57:46.429 --> 02:57:46.439 align:start position:0%
to call the committee's detection right
 
02:57:49.010 --> 02:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
now to section three of the bill uh
 
02:57:51.290 --> 02:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
which is the effective date and it's 60
 
02:57:54.410 --> 02:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
days after passage while I know it is
 
02:57:56.030 --> 02:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
challenging I don't think it would be
 
02:57:58.670 --> 02:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
impossible to address this issue before
 
02:58:01.010 --> 02:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
May 11th so we don't end up in a
 
02:58:03.170 --> 02:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
situation where thousands of people that
 
02:58:06.650 --> 02:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
are involved in having their drugs
 
02:58:08.210 --> 02:58:08.220 align:start position:0%
prescribed through Telehealth would have
 
02:58:10.730 --> 02:58:10.740 align:start position:0%
to have a subsequent in-person follow-up
 
02:58:12.349 --> 02:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
I don't think anyone wants to see that
 
02:58:14.530 --> 02:58:14.540 align:start position:0%
happen but there is a there is a
 
02:58:17.210 --> 02:58:17.220 align:start position:0%
misalignment of the public health
 
02:58:20.030 --> 02:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
emergency ending in May and these
 
02:58:23.330 --> 02:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
statutes so my hope is we get it perfect
 
02:58:24.950 --> 02:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
in the house so when the Senate gets it
 
02:58:26.630 --> 02:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
they just say great and we can move it
 
02:58:28.730 --> 02:58:28.740 align:start position:0%
along as quickly as possible and I'm
 
02:58:30.590 --> 02:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
committed to working with folks from DH
 
02:58:32.990 --> 02:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
in the department of that a few things
 
02:58:35.570 --> 02:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
that came up uh today that I uh would
 
02:58:37.969 --> 02:58:37.979 align:start position:0%
want to work with the committee on uh
 
02:58:40.010 --> 02:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
the first question out of the box was
 
02:58:41.990 --> 02:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
the reference to out-of-state Physicians
 
02:58:43.730 --> 02:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
I think it just doesn't belong there
 
02:58:45.530 --> 02:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary it's a drafting error
 
02:58:47.690 --> 02:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
you can't find that reference in the in
 
02:58:49.429 --> 02:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
the section would be my observation on
 
02:58:49.439 --> 02:58:51.230 align:start position:0%
the section would be my observation on
that

02:58:51.230 --> 02:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:58:54.050 --> 02:58:54.060 align:start position:0%
um another and and I have had great
 
02:58:56.150 --> 02:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
conversations with the folks with with
 
02:58:58.250 --> 02:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
Courtney from Dartmouth to get this
 
02:58:59.809 --> 02:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
right as well and it might not be a
 
02:59:01.309 --> 02:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
problem but it's representative Merchant
 
02:59:04.130 --> 02:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
as well aware and others perhaps as well
 
02:59:06.170 --> 02:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
that for the opioid treatment providers
 
02:59:08.690 --> 02:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
they technically don't prescribe
 
02:59:12.290 --> 02:59:12.300 align:start position:0%
methadone they order it so you go to the
 
02:59:12.300 --> 02:59:13.090 align:start position:0%
methadone they order it so you go to the
clinic

02:59:13.090 --> 02:59:13.100 align:start position:0%
clinic
 
02:59:15.769 --> 02:59:15.779 align:start position:0%
and you are evaluated by a physician or
 
02:59:19.070 --> 02:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
APRN and they order Methadone for you
 
02:59:21.469 --> 02:59:21.479 align:start position:0%
you don't get a prescription and go to a
 
02:59:24.769 --> 02:59:24.779 align:start position:0%
pharmacist for what I don't know is does
 
02:59:27.469 --> 02:59:27.479 align:start position:0%
anyone prescribe in that manner or is it
 
02:59:29.210 --> 02:59:29.220 align:start position:0%
all ordered and perhaps others would
 
02:59:31.490 --> 02:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
understand that Ben and I but I think
 
02:59:32.929 --> 02:59:32.939 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant's going to jump
 
02:59:34.070 --> 02:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
right in and answer that question for me
 
02:59:35.630 --> 02:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
it's changing
 
02:59:38.330 --> 02:59:38.340 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry federal law that's governing a
 
02:59:41.269 --> 02:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
lot of this is under change yes
 
02:59:41.279 --> 02:59:42.590 align:start position:0%
lot of this is under change yes
right

02:59:42.590 --> 02:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:59:44.090 --> 02:59:44.100 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
02:59:46.490 --> 02:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
um I think getting that
 
02:59:48.889 --> 02:59:48.899 align:start position:0%
um how we deal with uh methadone
 
02:59:51.110 --> 02:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
exception we want it to align with
 
02:59:53.389 --> 02:59:53.399 align:start position:0%
federal law uh but we need to be careful
 
02:59:55.550 --> 02:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
in the way we use the word prescribing
 
02:59:57.650 --> 02:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
so we don't mistakenly prevent the
 
02:59:59.870 --> 02:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
methadone clinics from you know doing
 
03:00:02.510 --> 03:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
what they do I should say with regards
 
03:00:04.849 --> 03:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
to the travel issues for that uh federal
 
03:00:08.870 --> 03:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
law and state law does allow uh for uh
 
03:00:10.090 --> 03:00:10.100 align:start position:0%
take homes
 
03:00:12.130 --> 03:00:12.140 align:start position:0%
very closely
 
03:00:14.210 --> 03:00:14.220 align:start position:0%
protected by that work but you don't
 
03:00:15.769 --> 03:00:15.779 align:start position:0%
have to for some people you don't have
 
03:00:18.230 --> 03:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
to come to the clinic every day you uh
 
03:00:20.269 --> 03:00:20.279 align:start position:0%
short durations of take-home drugs are
 
03:00:22.010 --> 03:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
prescribed but that's not done through
 
03:00:23.990 --> 03:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
telemedicine that's done through an
 
03:00:26.809 --> 03:00:26.819 align:start position:0%
in-person because the Federal Law
 
03:00:28.969 --> 03:00:28.979 align:start position:0%
requires that in the New Hampshire
 
03:00:32.389 --> 03:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
controlled Drug Act requires that we
 
03:00:35.210 --> 03:00:35.220 align:start position:0%
comply with the federal laws so
 
03:00:38.630 --> 03:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
um so finally with regard to House Bill
 
03:00:41.150 --> 03:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
503 again
 
03:00:43.550 --> 03:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's confusion confusing when you stack
 
03:00:45.710 --> 03:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
up the controlled Drug Act the
 
03:00:49.429 --> 03:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
Telehealth act and uh and um and the
 
03:00:52.130 --> 03:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
practice acts but I think the intention
 
03:00:54.830 --> 03:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
of 503 in the work this committee did on
 
03:00:57.250 --> 03:00:57.260 align:start position:0%
it was to create a carve out exception
 
03:01:02.809 --> 03:01:02.819 align:start position:0%
uh for uh mat and so it narrowed it to a
 
03:01:05.090 --> 03:01:05.100 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder there is another
 
03:01:07.910 --> 03:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
bill in the Senate which is working its
 
03:01:09.410 --> 03:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
way through the process it has a hearing
 
03:01:11.510 --> 03:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
next week which expands out a little
 
03:01:13.370 --> 03:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
further to include mental health
 
03:01:13.380 --> 03:01:14.830 align:start position:0%
further to include mental health
conditions

03:01:14.830 --> 03:01:14.840 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
03:01:17.690 --> 03:01:17.700 align:start position:0%
I think House Bill 500 might be more
 
03:01:20.570 --> 03:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
comprehensive than that and I wouldn't
 
03:01:22.370 --> 03:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
want to slow the work down on this
 
03:01:24.110 --> 03:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
because of what the Senate might be
 
03:01:26.150 --> 03:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
doing but just wanted to make the
 
03:01:27.710 --> 03:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
observation representative Bloom that I
 
03:01:29.450 --> 03:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
think we need while the work you did
 
03:01:31.250 --> 03:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
last year on 503 was important and
 
03:01:33.650 --> 03:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
helped with regard to mat
 
03:01:36.650 --> 03:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
um I I do think we need to go further
 
03:01:39.170 --> 03:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
with this legislation than than we did
 
03:01:40.309 --> 03:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
last year
 
03:01:42.530 --> 03:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
so I am happy to work with whatever
 
03:01:44.929 --> 03:01:44.939 align:start position:0%
process is underway with the
 
03:01:46.070 --> 03:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders with the committee a
 
03:01:48.469 --> 03:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with the our researchers uh
 
03:01:48.479 --> 03:01:49.370 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with the our researchers uh
to

03:01:49.370 --> 03:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:01:53.030 --> 03:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
um to try to uh Advance it here I didn't
 
03:01:55.010 --> 03:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear any opposition
 
03:01:56.210 --> 03:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
um I think most of what we want to do is
 
03:01:59.030 --> 03:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
get it right thank you questions yes
 
03:02:01.969 --> 03:02:01.979 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you for uh Mr
 
03:02:03.469 --> 03:02:03.479 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question I
 
03:02:05.150 --> 03:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
want to understand the scope of this a
 
03:02:06.530 --> 03:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
little bit better because the way it was
 
03:02:08.510 --> 03:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
presented was a very specific scenario
 
03:02:11.389 --> 03:02:11.399 align:start position:0%
but yeah I'm a provider I have a
 
03:02:13.190 --> 03:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
relationship with a patient for a long
 
03:02:15.349 --> 03:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
period of time I can still prescribe by
 
03:02:17.150 --> 03:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
telemedicine one way or the other what
 
03:02:18.650 --> 03:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is initiating
 
03:02:21.349 --> 03:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
therapy is that correct
 
03:02:23.630 --> 03:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
in other words like I've known Joe Smith
 
03:02:26.150 --> 03:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
for forever I prescribed from for 10
 
03:02:28.429 --> 03:02:28.439 align:start position:0%
years I can still one way or the other I
 
03:02:30.170 --> 03:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
can still write a script it's initiating
 
03:02:32.450 --> 03:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
therapy are you telling me I can't write
 
03:02:34.250 --> 03:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
an order by Telehealth for a patient I
 
03:02:35.450 --> 03:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
already have a relationship with that
 
03:02:37.130 --> 03:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
I've been prescribing for no I'm not
 
03:02:38.450 --> 03:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
she's nodding her head so that's
 
03:02:39.650 --> 03:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
important to me which way is she not
 
03:02:42.050 --> 03:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
gonna hit it's up and down
 
03:02:45.410 --> 03:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
uh I don't read this as preventing the
 
03:02:47.750 --> 03:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
initiation of treatment through to to
 
03:02:50.330 --> 03:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
Telehealth um those were important
 
03:02:53.870 --> 03:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
changes made in House Bill 1623 and 2020
 
03:02:56.809 --> 03:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
but I do know that both that bill and
 
03:02:58.849 --> 03:02:58.859 align:start position:0%
the current the practice acts require
 
03:03:02.210 --> 03:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
that that the physician or the API and
 
03:03:04.370 --> 03:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
use their professional judgment to
 
03:03:06.110 --> 03:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
determine when an in-person is
 
03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:07.370 align:start position:0%
determine when an in-person is
appropriate

03:03:07.370 --> 03:03:07.380 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:03:11.630 --> 03:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
okay and and follow up
 
03:03:19.389 --> 03:03:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:22.969 --> 03:03:22.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:25.070 --> 03:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
so if we were going to try and align
 
03:03:26.809 --> 03:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
this as closely as possible with the
 
03:03:26.819 --> 03:03:27.830 align:start position:0%
this as closely as possible with the
Federal

03:03:27.830 --> 03:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
03:03:32.389 --> 03:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
regulations and also to provide the
 
03:03:34.849 --> 03:03:34.859 align:start position:0%
greatest degree of flexibility
 
03:03:38.150 --> 03:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh would it be a drafting an acceptable
 
03:03:43.429 --> 03:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
drafting technique to make reference to
 
03:03:45.650 --> 03:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
the federal regulations in the broadest
 
03:03:47.450 --> 03:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
possible way
 
03:03:50.929 --> 03:03:50.939 align:start position:0%
as a as a way of doing that or could we
 
03:03:53.750 --> 03:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
simply be silent on the Federal
 
03:03:55.969 --> 03:03:55.979 align:start position:0%
Regulations knowing that if they are
 
03:03:59.990 --> 03:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:02.450 --> 03:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't know the answer to that
 
03:04:04.730 --> 03:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
and I don't mean to be flip about this
 
03:04:06.590 --> 03:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
but I'm wondering you know what's maybe
 
03:04:08.510 --> 03:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
we don't want to get too fancy with this
 
03:04:11.330 --> 03:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
bill because of the time constraints on
 
03:04:13.969 --> 03:04:13.979 align:start position:0%
it and if we make a unintended mistake
 
03:04:15.650 --> 03:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
with regard to those alignments and May
 
03:04:17.690 --> 03:04:17.700 align:start position:0%
11th comes it's really going to impact a
 
03:04:19.190 --> 03:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
lot of people so I think the there's
 
03:04:21.710 --> 03:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely I think a need to look at the
 
03:04:24.889 --> 03:04:24.899 align:start position:0%
controlled Drug Act and uh in these
 
03:04:26.450 --> 03:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
practice acts which are really the only
 
03:04:28.730 --> 03:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
two that allow for the prescribing 224
 
03:04:31.550 --> 03:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
and align all of that with what is apt
 
03:04:35.269 --> 03:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
to be a changing Federal regime
 
03:04:38.410 --> 03:04:38.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:40.190 --> 03:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
and I thought I was going to see
 
03:04:41.510 --> 03:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant volunteer to
 
03:04:43.610 --> 03:04:43.620 align:start position:0%
sponsor that bill but
 
03:04:46.670 --> 03:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
the other other questions
 
03:04:48.889 --> 03:04:48.899 align:start position:0%
if Mr chairman if I can make a comment
 
03:04:50.870 --> 03:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
yes okay good
 
03:04:53.389 --> 03:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that he's sort of
 
03:04:56.090 --> 03:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
touching upon is there's two parties
 
03:04:58.130 --> 03:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
here one's the prescriber and one's the
 
03:05:00.469 --> 03:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
dispenser and we have to be sure that
 
03:05:01.849 --> 03:05:01.859 align:start position:0%
we're in alignment with this fencing
 
03:05:03.170 --> 03:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
Community understand what we're doing in
 
03:05:04.429 --> 03:05:04.439 align:start position:0%
the prescribing Community otherwise
 
03:05:07.010 --> 03:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
we'll probably have some pushback and
 
03:05:10.490 --> 03:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
with May 11th coming rapidly I think we
 
03:05:12.170 --> 03:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
need to be sure that the dispensing
 
03:05:13.429 --> 03:05:13.439 align:start position:0%
communities involved with what we're
 
03:05:14.750 --> 03:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
doing as well as a prescribing Community
 
03:05:19.790 --> 03:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:21.590 --> 03:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other questions so thank
 
03:05:21.600 --> 03:05:24.110 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other questions so thank
you

03:05:24.110 --> 03:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:24.120 --> 03:05:24.769 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

03:05:24.769 --> 03:05:24.779 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
03:05:27.170 --> 03:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
um does anyone else wish to testify on
 
03:05:35.510 --> 03:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:37.550 --> 03:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
representative or something yeah I just
 
03:05:39.710 --> 03:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
had a quick 20 second follow-up for um
 
03:05:41.690 --> 03:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
representative Weber's earliest question
 
03:05:43.370 --> 03:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
about um the reference to the
 
03:05:44.809 --> 03:05:44.819 align:start position:0%
out-of-state Physicians and the
 
03:05:47.630 --> 03:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
out-of-state APR ends so I went back and
 
03:05:51.769 --> 03:05:51.779 align:start position:0%
read both 320 329 and 326.
 
03:05:56.030 --> 03:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
and it appears that um the first
 
03:05:58.070 --> 03:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
um line one reference to out-of-state
 
03:06:00.070 --> 03:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
positions is actually
 
03:06:02.750 --> 03:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
an error because it's referring to
 
03:06:04.550 --> 03:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
subsection two which is just above so
 
03:06:07.190 --> 03:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
that would need to be stricken and then
 
03:06:09.110 --> 03:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
um to follow up on the question about um
 
03:06:13.130 --> 03:06:13.140 align:start position:0%
line 13 the out-of-state APRN clause the
 
03:06:15.469 --> 03:06:15.479 align:start position:0%
larger subsection a to c is exactly
 
03:06:18.050 --> 03:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
existing law so there is no change to B
 
03:06:20.030 --> 03:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
that but it's here as a placeholder
 
03:06:23.330 --> 03:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
showing the changes to a and to C so
 
03:06:25.130 --> 03:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
there is no change to the the
 
03:06:28.429 --> 03:06:28.439 align:start position:0%
out-of-state APRN issue it's just here
 
03:06:31.910 --> 03:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
as a placeholder essentially
 
03:06:34.070 --> 03:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question thank you
 
03:06:37.790 --> 03:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:40.130 --> 03:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no one else to testify on HP
 
03:06:41.750 --> 03:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
500 I am going to close the public
 
03:06:44.630 --> 03:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
hearing on HP 500 and open the public
 
03:06:47.870 --> 03:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 325 and recognize the
 
03:06:49.429 --> 03:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative Gary
 
03:06:49.439 --> 03:06:56.630 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative Gary
Merchant

03:06:56.630 --> 03:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:56.640 --> 03:07:03.050 align:start position:0%
 
ment

03:07:03.050 --> 03:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:13.070 --> 03:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:19.790 --> 03:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:21.650 --> 03:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
again we need a pink card representative
 
03:07:21.660 --> 03:07:28.070 align:start position:0%
again we need a pink card representative
Merchant

03:07:28.070 --> 03:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:31.070 --> 03:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:07:33.490 --> 03:07:33.500 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Gary Merchant
 
03:07:36.230 --> 03:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
representing Sullivan County
 
03:07:38.210 --> 03:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
district 6 which is Claremont and
 
03:07:38.220 --> 03:07:39.170 align:start position:0%
district 6 which is Claremont and
Croydon

03:07:39.170 --> 03:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
Croydon
 
03:07:41.630 --> 03:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
I come before the committee for I think
 
03:07:44.450 --> 03:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
it's relatively simple bill but Others
 
03:07:46.250 --> 03:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
May don't agree with me
 
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
what happened was in the prescription
 
03:07:51.710 --> 03:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
drug sorry the prescription drug
 
03:07:51.720 --> 03:07:53.230 align:start position:0%
drug sorry the prescription drug
advisory

03:07:53.230 --> 03:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
advisory
 
03:07:56.330 --> 03:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
program is an advisory Council which is
 
03:07:59.510 --> 03:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
multidisciplinary with many different
 
03:07:59.520 --> 03:08:00.170 align:start position:0%
multidisciplinary with many different
um

03:08:00.170 --> 03:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:02.330 --> 03:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
Healthcare police force and so forth
 
03:08:04.610 --> 03:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
that are there along with legislators
 
03:08:06.830 --> 03:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
one of the issues we run into with Lotto
 
03:08:09.469 --> 03:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
boards when someone's term comes to an
 
03:08:11.150 --> 03:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
end is trying to find someone to replace
 
03:08:11.160 --> 03:08:12.230 align:start position:0%
end is trying to find someone to replace
them

03:08:12.230 --> 03:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:08:13.969 --> 03:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
so instead of having an Abrupt and
 
03:08:15.469 --> 03:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
that's trying to find a way to say if
 
03:08:17.809 --> 03:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
they're on the advisory Council
 
03:08:19.550 --> 03:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
they could stay on the advisory Council
 
03:08:21.769 --> 03:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
until they found a replacement
 
03:08:25.370 --> 03:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
well it's brought to my attention by rep
 
03:08:26.929 --> 03:08:26.939 align:start position:0%
attorney Williams from the Department of
 
03:08:28.790 --> 03:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
healthy human services the way it's
 
03:08:30.410 --> 03:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
written right now they could be there
 
03:08:32.210 --> 03:08:32.220 align:start position:0%
until they pass away
 
03:08:34.610 --> 03:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
that was never the intent so I did make
 
03:08:36.889 --> 03:08:36.899 align:start position:0%
an amendment based upon his
 
03:08:40.010 --> 03:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
recommendation to make a change so they
 
03:08:42.769 --> 03:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
can stay on the advise the council for
 
03:08:45.769 --> 03:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
up to six months after the term expires
 
03:08:47.630 --> 03:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
so it's just allowing for a more
 
03:08:50.750 --> 03:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility when you have folks that are
 
03:08:52.670 --> 03:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
hard to find specifically in this case
 
03:08:55.429 --> 03:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
was Dr Cropper Stephen Crawford who's a
 
03:08:57.830 --> 03:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
state veterinarian it's a small pool of
 
03:09:00.290 --> 03:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
candidates his term is coming up it's
 
03:09:02.630 --> 03:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
what caused it to go forward and we want
 
03:09:04.309 --> 03:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
to find it at least some time to find
 
03:09:05.630 --> 03:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
another veterinarian so that's the
 
03:09:08.210 --> 03:09:08.220 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill
 
03:09:09.830 --> 03:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
okay questions for representative
 
03:09:09.840 --> 03:09:12.469 align:start position:0%
okay questions for representative
Merchant

03:09:12.469 --> 03:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:16.670 --> 03:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
see no questions wow really was quick we
 
03:09:19.130 --> 03:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
did get your print card for hb66 I don't
 
03:09:20.510 --> 03:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
believe we have one for this one I'll
 
03:09:22.309 --> 03:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
get one thank you Mr chair okay thank
 
03:09:22.319 --> 03:09:23.570 align:start position:0%
get one thank you Mr chair okay thank
you

03:09:23.570 --> 03:09:23.580 align:start position:0%

03:09:27.170 --> 03:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
okay no questions for uh this bill
 
03:09:29.870 --> 03:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
okay going going gone thank you all
 
03:09:31.550 --> 03:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
right uh
 
03:09:33.349 --> 03:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
with that I will close the public
 
03:09:37.429 --> 03:09:37.439 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 325 and we will recess
 
03:09:37.439 --> 03:09:38.929 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 325 and we will recess
until

03:09:38.929 --> 03:09:38.939 align:start position:0%
until
 
03:09:40.190 --> 03:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
um I don't know it was one o'clock

we will resume our public hearings on
 
04:17:52.330 --> 04:17:52.340 align:start position:0%

record yes is comparable to mine it's
 
04:18:53.040 --> 04:18:54.710 align:start position:0%
record yes is comparable to mine it's
horrible

04:18:54.710 --> 04:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
horrible
 
04:18:58.189 --> 04:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:00.290 --> 04:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
that was bad I'm sorry
 
04:19:00.300 --> 04:19:03.729 align:start position:0%
that was bad I'm sorry
foreign

04:19:03.729 --> 04:19:03.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:07.429 --> 04:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
to introduce House Bill 611 which is an
 
04:19:09.469 --> 04:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
act that will remove the language that
 
04:19:11.689 --> 04:19:11.699 align:start position:0%
states that one must seek traditional
 
04:19:14.090 --> 04:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
treatments and therapies and one must
 
04:19:16.070 --> 04:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
also have failed to respond to this
 
04:19:18.769 --> 04:19:18.779 align:start position:0%
treatment in order to become a patient
 
04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
of the therapy therapeutic cannabis
 
04:19:23.210 --> 04:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
program in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:19:26.450 --> 04:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying as both a lawmaker and as
 
04:19:29.330 --> 04:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
a patient at Prime ATC in Merrimack New
 
04:19:29.340 --> 04:19:30.290 align:start position:0%
a patient at Prime ATC in Merrimack New
Hampshire

04:19:30.290 --> 04:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:19:32.750 --> 04:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
I did not seek care there until my
 
04:19:36.110 --> 04:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
health was in a shambles and in 2017 I
 
04:19:37.370 --> 04:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
walked through this door of the
 
04:19:40.130 --> 04:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
dispensary for the first time I had no
 
04:19:42.410 --> 04:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
idea that I had qualified before that
 
04:19:42.420 --> 04:19:45.290 align:start position:0%
idea that I had qualified before that
time

04:19:45.290 --> 04:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:48.530 --> 04:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
the statements to me seemed vague in in
 
04:19:51.469 --> 04:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
the language in the law and I just
 
04:19:54.889 --> 04:19:54.899 align:start position:0%
didn't think that I fit I'm not a fan of
 
04:19:58.429 --> 04:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
spinal surgery I'm not a fan of some of
 
04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
the treatments that I should have to
 
04:20:02.150 --> 04:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
consider and fail at
 
04:20:04.010 --> 04:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
and I would never take a chance on
 
04:20:06.469 --> 04:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
unless I were unable to completely
 
04:20:09.110 --> 04:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
enable an incapacitated
 
04:20:12.170 --> 04:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
in terms of trying to live my life
 
04:20:14.990 --> 04:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
I had gotten very far afield with
 
04:20:17.630 --> 04:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
traditional medicines
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
prescription labels from the dispensary
 
04:20:22.370 --> 04:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
include every ingredient that is in the
 
04:20:22.380 --> 04:20:25.670 align:start position:0%
include every ingredient that is in the
product

04:20:25.670 --> 04:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:28.130 --> 04:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
while pharmaceutical manufacturers don't
 
04:20:30.110 --> 04:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
have to use the same compounds to
 
04:20:32.150 --> 04:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
stabilize medication and deliver it to
 
04:20:34.130 --> 04:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
you in a form that you can swallow and
 
04:20:34.140 --> 04:20:35.269 align:start position:0%
you in a form that you can swallow and
ingest

04:20:35.269 --> 04:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
ingest
 
04:20:37.969 --> 04:20:37.979 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
04:20:40.429 --> 04:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
take a difference and excuse me look at
 
04:20:43.189 --> 04:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
this versus the um the medication that
 
04:20:44.570 --> 04:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
we can get through the therapeutic
 
04:20:46.550 --> 04:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis program
 
04:20:48.950 --> 04:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
stabilizers suspensions and all those
 
04:20:50.570 --> 04:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
things that carry your drug into the
 
04:20:53.809 --> 04:20:53.819 align:start position:0%
body when you swallow or when you have a
 
04:20:56.689 --> 04:20:56.699 align:start position:0%
topical or or other route of
 
04:20:56.699 --> 04:20:58.790 align:start position:0%
topical or or other route of
administration

04:20:58.790 --> 04:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
administration
 
04:21:01.130 --> 04:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
is all listed everything in the
 
04:21:02.990 --> 04:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
ingredients is there the inert
 
04:21:06.410 --> 04:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
substances that they say
 
04:21:08.450 --> 04:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
in traditional medications and
 
04:21:10.309 --> 04:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals you should not be as
 
04:21:13.010 --> 04:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
concerned about particularly in generic
 
04:21:15.650 --> 04:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
medications are not in the Cannabis
 
04:21:18.830 --> 04:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
medications that people seek
 
04:21:21.530 --> 04:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
at a dispensary like at a pharmacy only
 
04:21:24.650 --> 04:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
better in my opinion inconsistencies in
 
04:21:26.769 --> 04:21:26.779 align:start position:0%
the medication are right on the label
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
everything that is in the medication is
 
04:21:31.309 --> 04:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
right there these capsules are
 
04:21:33.170 --> 04:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
manufactured they're sourced they're a
 
04:21:35.450 --> 04:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
hundred percent within the dispensaries
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
they start with a grow house that has no
 
04:21:40.429 --> 04:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
pesticides in use they are also no
 
04:21:42.830 --> 04:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
herbicides in use no fertilizers and
 
04:21:44.630 --> 04:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
there are known bacteria and viruses
 
04:21:47.830 --> 04:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
that the plants that can can succumb to
 
04:21:51.290 --> 04:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
that could wipe out an entire crop and
 
04:21:53.630 --> 04:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
it is a very sterile environment that
 
04:21:56.090 --> 04:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
these I wouldn't go as far as to say
 
04:21:58.490 --> 04:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
clinically sterile but it what like what
 
04:21:59.990 --> 04:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
I would liken to a sterile environment
 
04:22:04.070 --> 04:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of the process of growing in
 
04:22:06.889 --> 04:22:06.899 align:start position:0%
synthesis of the products that they make
 
04:22:08.990 --> 04:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
the very controlled process and the
 
04:22:10.969 --> 04:22:10.979 align:start position:0%
ability to synthesize the flower they
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
grow into a product that is labeled with
 
04:22:15.530 --> 04:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
the exact ingredients empowers the
 
04:22:18.110 --> 04:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
patient to have a sense of direction as
 
04:22:20.990 --> 04:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
they try to establish their medication
 
04:22:23.750 --> 04:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
routine it gives them a list of
 
04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
ingredients that gives them a list of
 
04:22:27.710 --> 04:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
terpenes cannabinoids and it tells you
 
04:22:30.110 --> 04:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
the percentages the amounts and it tells
 
04:22:34.429 --> 04:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:37.849 --> 04:22:37.859 align:start position:0%
no matter what the item is all of the
 
04:22:40.490 --> 04:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
ingredients are listed
 
04:22:42.769 --> 04:22:42.779 align:start position:0%
there are fast-acting products and there
 
04:22:44.150 --> 04:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
are products that help you sleep through
 
04:22:46.309 --> 04:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
the night there are capsules topicals
 
04:22:46.319 --> 04:22:47.469 align:start position:0%
the night there are capsules topicals
tinctures

04:22:47.469 --> 04:22:47.479 align:start position:0%
tinctures
 
04:22:50.030 --> 04:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
suppositories and many many forms of
 
04:22:52.910 --> 04:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
medication delivery liquid concentrated
 
04:22:55.210 --> 04:22:55.220 align:start position:0%
for your own at home
 
04:22:59.150 --> 04:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
that you can buy a thing of oil that you
 
04:23:01.010 --> 04:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
can bake your own goodies with if you
 
04:23:02.809 --> 04:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
want and I call them goodies just
 
04:23:04.309 --> 04:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
because they're good when you take your
 
04:23:06.889 --> 04:23:06.899 align:start position:0%
medicine and instead of take trying to
 
04:23:09.250 --> 04:23:09.260 align:start position:0%
take medicine when you're feeling very
 
04:23:12.710 --> 04:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
sick or or tired when you don't have
 
04:23:15.170 --> 04:23:15.180 align:start position:0%
enough saliva you want something sweet
 
04:23:17.150 --> 04:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
you want something
 
04:23:22.550 --> 04:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:24.410 --> 04:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
I will be sending you an email that has
 
04:23:26.450 --> 04:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
a picture of the um the medication
 
04:23:29.150 --> 04:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
labels and also um
 
04:23:30.889 --> 04:23:30.899 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:23:36.349 --> 04:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:38.570 --> 04:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
the link to the dispensary so that you
 
04:23:41.389 --> 04:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
can see the products that they carry the
 
04:23:43.130 --> 04:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
folks at the dispensaries are trained to
 
04:23:44.809 --> 04:23:44.819 align:start position:0%
help you find the correct product for
 
04:23:46.969 --> 04:23:46.979 align:start position:0%
the symptoms you're experiencing the
 
04:23:49.750 --> 04:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
feedback that they you give to them
 
04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
extends all the way back to the grow
 
04:23:53.689 --> 04:23:53.699 align:start position:0%
house where they try to grow what you
 
04:23:56.090 --> 04:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
need they ask you questions and they try
 
04:23:58.309 --> 04:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
to find out exactly what symptoms you
 
04:24:00.110 --> 04:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
find certain strains helpful with so
 
04:24:01.550 --> 04:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
that the next person who comes in
 
04:24:03.290 --> 04:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to do that
 
04:24:06.050 --> 04:24:06.060 align:start position:0%
as the strains are less available they
 
04:24:07.910 --> 04:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
are not always
 
04:24:09.950 --> 04:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
something that can be brought to harvest
 
04:24:11.450 --> 04:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
people need to know what those
 
04:24:13.189 --> 04:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
ingredients are in order to seek the
 
04:24:14.990 --> 04:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
kind of relief that they need for the
 
04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
specific problem that we're treating
 
04:24:19.610 --> 04:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
right now we're treating a discrete list
 
04:24:22.670 --> 04:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
of illnesses that we have come before
 
04:24:26.170 --> 04:24:26.180 align:start position:0%
this body to ask for permission to treat
 
04:24:28.790 --> 04:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
again and again since the program was
 
04:24:31.429 --> 04:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
offered up to New Hampshire residents in
 
04:24:31.439 --> 04:24:34.689 align:start position:0%
offered up to New Hampshire residents in
2013.

04:24:34.689 --> 04:24:34.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:37.969 --> 04:24:37.979 align:start position:0%
you will hear more about all of this in
 
04:24:39.889 --> 04:24:39.899 align:start position:0%
subsequent testimony
 
04:24:42.410 --> 04:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
so where the law states that one must
 
04:24:44.450 --> 04:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
try traditional medicines and procedures
 
04:24:45.950 --> 04:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
has failed
 
04:24:49.070 --> 04:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
one has to ask what is that failure
 
04:24:51.110 --> 04:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
is that failure that you had too many
 
04:24:53.269 --> 04:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
sinus effects and which side effects are
 
04:24:54.830 --> 04:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
considered to be prohibitive in
 
04:24:56.990 --> 04:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
interfering with your function
 
04:24:59.330 --> 04:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
if you have wake up in the morning after
 
04:25:01.189 --> 04:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
taking opiates the night before you
 
04:25:02.809 --> 04:25:02.819 align:start position:0%
might notice that your eyes are swollen
 
04:25:04.490 --> 04:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
and you have difficulty opening them
 
04:25:06.349 --> 04:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
without having a compress
 
04:25:08.330 --> 04:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
some people have reactions to things
 
04:25:11.269 --> 04:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
where they cannot digest the food that
 
04:25:12.830 --> 04:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
they need to have and where they need to
 
04:25:14.570 --> 04:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
put on weight because they've been in
 
04:25:17.150 --> 04:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
treatment for a long time and that many
 
04:25:18.469 --> 04:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
of these treatments suppress the
 
04:25:20.689 --> 04:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
appetite and make someone look very thin
 
04:25:24.110 --> 04:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
and and have difficulty with managing
 
04:25:24.120 --> 04:25:28.010 align:start position:0%
and and have difficulty with managing
themselves

04:25:28.010 --> 04:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:30.410 --> 04:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the medications that
 
04:25:32.929 --> 04:25:32.939 align:start position:0%
you can get at the dispensary and all of
 
04:25:34.849 --> 04:25:34.859 align:start position:0%
the forms that they come in you realize
 
04:25:37.969 --> 04:25:37.979 align:start position:0%
that people get the opportunity to buy
 
04:25:39.769 --> 04:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
something that is concentrated but only
 
04:25:42.410 --> 04:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
take a tiny bit of it at a time so I
 
04:25:44.570 --> 04:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
will use an example of a 50 milligram
 
04:25:44.580 --> 04:25:46.149 align:start position:0%
will use an example of a 50 milligram
THC

04:25:46.149 --> 04:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
THC
 
04:25:50.210 --> 04:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
that is in an iced tea mix if you would
 
04:25:52.790 --> 04:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
like iced tea or something to sip and
 
04:25:54.889 --> 04:25:54.899 align:start position:0%
you want to make sure that you can tell
 
04:25:57.410 --> 04:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
the difference between one milligram and
 
04:25:59.630 --> 04:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
50 milligrams this would be a good way
 
04:26:00.769 --> 04:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
to try
 
04:26:03.110 --> 04:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
so a tincture would do the same thing
 
04:26:04.910 --> 04:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
where you have a little tiny dropper
 
04:26:06.590 --> 04:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
bottle and there's one or two drops and
 
04:26:08.630 --> 04:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
that may be all you need
 
04:26:11.030 --> 04:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
personally I have found that the CBD
 
04:26:13.309 --> 04:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
concentrations that are strictly CBD are
 
04:26:15.950 --> 04:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
very helpful and at times I wish that
 
04:26:18.349 --> 04:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
they were in a slower dose so I don't
 
04:26:20.630 --> 04:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
take them but what would I do about that
 
04:26:22.429 --> 04:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
I would turn around and say you know
 
04:26:24.530 --> 04:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
something some of us might benefit from
 
04:26:26.750 --> 04:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
a two and a half milligram dose I
 
04:26:28.309 --> 04:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
haven't told them yet so they're hearing
 
04:26:28.319 --> 04:26:30.010 align:start position:0%
haven't told them yet so they're hearing
now

04:26:30.010 --> 04:26:30.020 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:26:33.530 --> 04:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
if I could ask it appears that the bill
 
04:26:35.990 --> 04:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
has a very limited scope it's deleting
 
04:26:38.389 --> 04:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
like a couple of lines could you address
 
04:26:40.729 --> 04:26:40.739 align:start position:0%
that aspect of it for us
 
04:26:43.969 --> 04:26:43.979 align:start position:0%
yes I certainly can
 
04:26:45.889 --> 04:26:45.899 align:start position:0%
the rest of my testimony is just an
 
04:26:48.290 --> 04:26:48.300 align:start position:0%
impact statement and so and I although I
 
04:26:50.090 --> 04:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
think that's very important so is this
 
04:26:52.130 --> 04:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
so when we go through the build line by
 
04:26:52.140 --> 04:26:52.910 align:start position:0%
so when we go through the build line by
line

04:26:52.910 --> 04:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:26:54.590 --> 04:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
um online
 
04:26:57.110 --> 04:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
as you see on line five
 
04:26:59.210 --> 04:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
we have we're coming to where we're I'm
 
04:27:01.849 --> 04:27:01.859 align:start position:0%
striking the qualification on severe
 
04:27:05.510 --> 04:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
pain that says that has not responded to
 
04:27:08.030 --> 04:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
previously prescribed medication or
 
04:27:10.309 --> 04:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
surgical measures or for which other
 
04:27:12.889 --> 04:27:12.899 align:start position:0%
treatment options produce serious side
 
04:27:12.899 --> 04:27:16.130 align:start position:0%
treatment options produce serious side
effects

04:27:16.130 --> 04:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
we are not striking constant or severe
 
04:27:22.250 --> 04:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
nausea moderate to severe vomiting
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
seizures and other in reactions that one
 
04:27:29.090 --> 04:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:32.030 --> 04:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:35.210 --> 04:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
relating to this aspect of the bill does
 
04:27:40.269 --> 04:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:43.130 --> 04:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:27:45.830 --> 04:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:27:45.840 --> 04:27:46.790 align:start position:0%
um thank you and thank you for taking my
question

04:27:46.790 --> 04:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:27:50.450 --> 04:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative Vale so you're not
 
04:27:50.460 --> 04:27:53.990 align:start position:0%
representative Vale so you're not
changing

04:27:53.990 --> 04:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:58.130 --> 04:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
a qualifying condition we were just
 
04:28:02.090 --> 04:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
removing an obstacle for
 
04:28:05.149 --> 04:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
a doctor would have already okayed
 
04:28:07.729 --> 04:28:07.739 align:start position:0%
somebody as having some kind of chronic
 
04:28:11.269 --> 04:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
pain and that they would be eligible to
 
04:28:14.929 --> 04:28:14.939 align:start position:0%
go to a therapeutic cannabis dispensary
 
04:28:18.110 --> 04:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
and get something for pain so this bill
 
04:28:20.330 --> 04:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
seems kind of simple you're just
 
04:28:23.570 --> 04:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
removing that line about
 
04:28:26.389 --> 04:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
has not responded to previous medication
 
04:28:29.750 --> 04:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
or surgical measures and I wondered how
 
04:28:35.330 --> 04:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:37.429 --> 04:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question is yes
 
04:28:39.950 --> 04:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative upper nutm and the reason
 
04:28:42.649 --> 04:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
that um that we really look at this is
 
04:28:42.659 --> 04:28:43.729 align:start position:0%
that um that we really look at this is
because

04:28:43.729 --> 04:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:28:46.490 --> 04:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
you know there's Untold costs to trying
 
04:28:48.229 --> 04:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
these medications that cannot be
 
04:28:49.969 --> 04:28:49.979 align:start position:0%
accommodated in the law and may not be
 
04:28:51.290 --> 04:28:51.300 align:start position:0%
something that you talk about with your
 
04:28:51.300 --> 04:28:52.849 align:start position:0%
something that you talk about with your
prescriber

04:28:52.849 --> 04:28:52.859 align:start position:0%
prescriber
 
04:28:55.490 --> 04:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
so when we're looking at this what's
 
04:28:57.950 --> 04:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
preventing and the obstacle was a good
 
04:28:59.570 --> 04:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
word to use because we're talking about
 
04:29:01.790 --> 04:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
severe pain we're not talking about
 
04:29:03.950 --> 04:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
severe pain that the state approves of
 
04:29:06.170 --> 04:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
or doesn't approve of we're talking
 
04:29:08.269 --> 04:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
about asking your provider to be able to
 
04:29:10.070 --> 04:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
say well this is severe pain I'm going
 
04:29:12.410 --> 04:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
to send you there it may be or may not
 
04:29:15.769 --> 04:29:15.779 align:start position:0%
be chronic pain but in the case of
 
04:29:20.090 --> 04:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
severe pain that has not responded
 
04:29:21.649 --> 04:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
this will make a big difference for
 
04:29:22.969 --> 04:29:22.979 align:start position:0%
people it certainly would have made a
 
04:29:24.710 --> 04:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
big difference for me and in fact I
 
04:29:27.530 --> 04:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
would have been a sooner sooner engaged
 
04:29:28.849 --> 04:29:28.859 align:start position:0%
in the program and probably would have
 
04:29:30.649 --> 04:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
resolved some of my issues a lot sooner
 
04:29:33.710 --> 04:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Leon thank you
 
04:29:35.269 --> 04:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you representative
 
04:29:37.610 --> 04:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
for bringing this bill to us
 
04:29:39.170 --> 04:29:39.180 align:start position:0%
um just looking at these and talking
 
04:29:41.090 --> 04:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
about your history were you under the
 
04:29:42.590 --> 04:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
impression that you might need to have a
 
04:29:42.600 --> 04:29:46.689 align:start position:0%
impression that you might need to have a
question

04:29:46.689 --> 04:29:46.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:48.889 --> 04:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
I didn't
 
04:29:52.429 --> 04:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to if I could reframe all
 
04:29:55.670 --> 04:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
we're doing here is removing barriers
 
04:29:58.269 --> 04:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
that might be
 
04:29:58.279 --> 04:30:00.849 align:start position:0%
that might be
unnecessary

04:30:00.849 --> 04:30:00.859 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
04:30:03.889 --> 04:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
and which don't need to be enumerated
 
04:30:06.590 --> 04:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
because if we are comfortable now
 
04:30:09.469 --> 04:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
because we have more experience than we
 
04:30:11.990 --> 04:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
did when we drafted this
 
04:30:15.830 --> 04:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
that Physicians We Trust Physicians to
 
04:30:19.550 --> 04:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
say you could do A B C or D or you could
 
04:30:21.769 --> 04:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
try this and you could try this before
 
04:30:24.050 --> 04:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
you had to do a b and c and d and have
 
04:30:26.510 --> 04:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.689 --> 04:30:29.699 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
04:30:33.170 --> 04:30:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:37.490 --> 04:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:39.050 --> 04:30:39.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:30:40.910 --> 04:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:30:43.910 --> 04:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm just looking at the statute that
 
04:30:46.729 --> 04:30:46.739 align:start position:0%
you handed out to us the entire
 
04:30:46.739 --> 04:30:47.590 align:start position:0%
you handed out to us the entire
um

04:30:47.590 --> 04:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:51.649 --> 04:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
126x and on the second page
 
04:30:51.659 --> 04:30:52.610 align:start position:0%
126x and on the second page
um

04:30:52.610 --> 04:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:56.330 --> 04:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
under Roman nine
 
04:30:58.729 --> 04:30:58.739 align:start position:0%
then underneath two where it says qual
 
04:31:00.889 --> 04:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
there's a b it says qualifying medical
 
04:31:03.830 --> 04:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
condition also means this is under the
 
04:31:05.330 --> 04:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
paragraph that you're amending with your
 
04:31:07.849 --> 04:31:07.859 align:start position:0%
bill but the next thing says moderate to
 
04:31:09.950 --> 04:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
severe chronic pain
 
04:31:12.110 --> 04:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
and then there's a redundancy it says
 
04:31:13.849 --> 04:31:13.859 align:start position:0%
that same line severe pain not responded
 
04:31:16.790 --> 04:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
to should we
 
04:31:16.800 --> 04:31:18.290 align:start position:0%
to should we
okay

04:31:18.290 --> 04:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:31:18.300 --> 04:31:19.969 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:31:19.969 --> 04:31:19.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:22.130 --> 04:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
04:31:24.710 --> 04:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
what if we just struck out
 
04:31:24.720 --> 04:31:27.110 align:start position:0%
what if we just struck out
chronic

04:31:27.110 --> 04:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
chronic
 
04:31:29.269 --> 04:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
from that part too
 
04:31:34.729 --> 04:31:34.739 align:start position:0%
that is a i d ICD diagnosis
 
04:31:37.130 --> 04:31:37.140 align:start position:0%
and therefore and I forget I'm sorry
 
04:31:38.929 --> 04:31:38.939 align:start position:0%
which version we're on at this point
 
04:31:41.510 --> 04:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
because I'm not working in a clinical
 
04:31:43.309 --> 04:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
setting any longer
 
04:31:46.910 --> 04:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
but um chronic pain is a is a it's a
 
04:31:48.830 --> 04:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
diagnosis for any kind of pain that
 
04:31:51.590 --> 04:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
continues on and pain syndromes are
 
04:31:54.830 --> 04:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
really a different animal than the kind
 
04:31:56.990 --> 04:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
of thing that someone goes through
 
04:32:00.530 --> 04:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
um with severe pain and the reason for
 
04:32:02.269 --> 04:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
that is because there's a feedback loop
 
04:32:04.070 --> 04:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
when you use some of these treatments
 
04:32:06.229 --> 04:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
and it's a spiral where you can't tell
 
04:32:08.510 --> 04:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
what's going on and and side effects are
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:14.570 --> 04:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
as we know some of these medications are
 
04:32:14.580 --> 04:32:15.830 align:start position:0%
as we know some of these medications are
extremely

04:32:15.830 --> 04:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
04:32:17.870 --> 04:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
um intoxicating
 
04:32:20.090 --> 04:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
and we don't want people to take
 
04:32:21.769 --> 04:32:21.779 align:start position:0%
something that's extremely toxicating
 
04:32:23.269 --> 04:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
that has things that they don't know
 
04:32:26.750 --> 04:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:28.910 --> 04:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:32:31.370 --> 04:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
yes representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
04:32:34.490 --> 04:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
04:32:36.290 --> 04:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
I'm struggling with this a little bit
 
04:32:38.570 --> 04:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
not a lot a bit just a little bit maybe
 
04:32:40.610 --> 04:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
you can help me
 
04:32:40.620 --> 04:32:41.330 align:start position:0%
you can help me
um

04:32:41.330 --> 04:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:43.969 --> 04:32:43.979 align:start position:0%
I personally
 
04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
um when I we we look at an algorithmic
 
04:32:47.630 --> 04:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
way of thinking about things when we
 
04:32:49.729 --> 04:32:49.739 align:start position:0%
treat people
 
04:32:51.889 --> 04:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
um I don't personally think of cannabis
 
04:32:53.689 --> 04:32:53.699 align:start position:0%
as a benign drug I think it has a
 
04:32:55.429 --> 04:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
potential to cause problems in some
 
04:32:57.830 --> 04:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
people that we need to respect I would
 
04:32:59.630 --> 04:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
never personally use it as the first
 
04:33:01.490 --> 04:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
line treatment for any of these things
 
04:33:04.310 --> 04:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
with a couple exceptions
 
04:33:07.490 --> 04:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
um with that said and I'm curious how
 
04:33:09.349 --> 04:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
you would answer that like there's a lot
 
04:33:11.209 --> 04:33:11.219 align:start position:0%
of benign things that we do that don't
 
04:33:13.551 --> 04:33:13.561 align:start position:0%
really cause a lot of bad problems and
 
04:33:17.650 --> 04:33:17.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:19.730 --> 04:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
really I really need to have a better
 
04:33:21.590 --> 04:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
reason why we need to get rid of this
 
04:33:21.600 --> 04:33:25.070 align:start position:0%
reason why we need to get rid of this
restriction

04:33:25.070 --> 04:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:27.051 --> 04:33:27.061 align:start position:0%
I can give you a better reason as I
 
04:33:29.390 --> 04:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony all right and if
 
04:33:31.551 --> 04:33:31.561 align:start position:0%
it's not a better reason I'm sorry but
 
04:33:33.949 --> 04:33:33.959 align:start position:0%
this to me is a better reason but I do
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
want to also say that cannabis is in no
 
04:33:39.650 --> 04:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
way benign and in no way do I
 
04:33:41.929 --> 04:33:41.939 align:start position:0%
underestimate what the black market can
 
04:33:43.551 --> 04:33:43.561 align:start position:0%
do with the medications that we're
 
04:33:46.010 --> 04:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
talking about we know this we know this
 
04:33:48.170 --> 04:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
with opiates and we know this with
 
04:33:50.689 --> 04:33:50.699 align:start position:0%
almost all of the street drugs that we
 
04:33:53.390 --> 04:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
have now that come from the formation of
 
04:33:54.949 --> 04:33:54.959 align:start position:0%
other drugs that we had in the last
 
04:33:57.470 --> 04:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
century that we were Distributing and
 
04:34:00.230 --> 04:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
that we were freely flowing and we were
 
04:34:06.189 --> 04:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:09.170 --> 04:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh Mr chair may I continue
 
04:34:14.090 --> 04:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:16.131 --> 04:34:16.141 align:start position:0%
before I go
 
04:34:18.709 --> 04:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say anything I don't
 
04:34:21.890 --> 04:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
want to ever miss an opportunity to tell
 
04:34:24.230 --> 04:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee
 
04:34:26.269 --> 04:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
how much stigma presents in the
 
04:34:28.609 --> 04:34:28.619 align:start position:0%
relationship between a person and their
 
04:34:31.551 --> 04:34:31.561 align:start position:0%
doctor a person in the pharmacy and how
 
04:34:33.529 --> 04:34:33.539 align:start position:0%
dangerous that is
 
04:34:35.510 --> 04:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
years back I had been prescribed a
 
04:34:37.910 --> 04:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
long-acting opiate as a short and a
 
04:34:40.310 --> 04:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
short acting opiate at the same time
 
04:34:42.230 --> 04:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
when I went to the pharmacy to pick up
 
04:34:44.390 --> 04:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
some education it was for a pre-surgical
 
04:34:47.810 --> 04:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
issue and the pharmacy staff gave me a
 
04:34:50.029 --> 04:34:50.039 align:start position:0%
strange look the pharmacist came over
 
04:34:51.410 --> 04:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
and he said are you going to take all
 
04:34:54.590 --> 04:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
this medication at once
 
04:34:56.631 --> 04:34:56.641 align:start position:0%
I said no
 
04:35:00.109 --> 04:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
I got home I opened up the bag
 
04:35:03.551 --> 04:35:03.561 align:start position:0%
I had an order for five milligram
 
04:35:07.010 --> 04:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
percocet pills but I left that Pharmacy
 
04:35:09.830 --> 04:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
with something that had buprenorphine in
 
04:35:12.830 --> 04:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
it and something that had was 20
 
04:35:16.189 --> 04:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
milligrams and this was at a CVS 20
 
04:35:18.349 --> 04:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
milligram percocet tablets which I
 
04:35:21.769 --> 04:35:21.779 align:start position:0%
didn't know existed not Percocet I mean
 
04:35:23.990 --> 04:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
oxycodone and part I'm sorry I'm just
 
04:35:25.730 --> 04:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
might need to clarify some of these
 
04:35:29.029 --> 04:35:29.039 align:start position:0%
things I'm extremely anxious I have a
 
04:35:31.730 --> 04:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
crisis going on at home and I I'm
 
04:35:33.529 --> 04:35:33.539 align:start position:0%
struggling with that right now so I have
 
04:35:36.230 --> 04:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
to just put that on the record
 
04:35:39.109 --> 04:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
um this critical area error of
 
04:35:40.789 --> 04:35:40.799 align:start position:0%
dispensing that kind of medication
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
that's a terrible mistake and of course
 
04:35:44.390 --> 04:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
I pursued it but there is no
 
04:35:47.029 --> 04:35:47.039 align:start position:0%
accountability I've sat in my my
 
04:35:49.070 --> 04:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
Orthopedic surgeon's office and had him
 
04:35:51.890 --> 04:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
tell look at my med list and say what do
 
04:35:54.410 --> 04:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
you do take pills all day
 
04:35:56.631 --> 04:35:56.641 align:start position:0%
yes that was the last time I ever saw
 
04:35:58.849 --> 04:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
that doctor but I wondered how many
 
04:36:00.830 --> 04:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
times he said that to other people like
 
04:36:00.840 --> 04:36:01.670 align:start position:0%
times he said that to other people like
me

04:36:01.670 --> 04:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:36:04.310 --> 04:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
he did not say to me that he thought I
 
04:36:06.709 --> 04:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
had a problem or that he wondered if I
 
04:36:09.529 --> 04:36:09.539 align:start position:0%
had a problem or any of those things and
 
04:36:12.289 --> 04:36:12.299 align:start position:0%
when I look at that medication list it's
 
04:36:14.209 --> 04:36:14.219 align:start position:0%
astounding to me that I ever took those
 
04:36:16.070 --> 04:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
medications and stood up and walked
 
04:36:18.529 --> 04:36:18.539 align:start position:0%
around let alone functioned as a state
 
04:36:20.990 --> 04:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative and as I sit here before
 
04:36:22.849 --> 04:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
you I feel like I have to prove to you
 
04:36:25.189 --> 04:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
that I'm not a stoner and I'm not an
 
04:36:27.410 --> 04:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
opiate addict but I'm trying to treat my
 
04:36:29.449 --> 04:36:29.459 align:start position:0%
illnesses and I'm trying to take care of
 
04:36:31.310 --> 04:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
myself and and the others that are
 
04:36:34.131 --> 04:36:34.141 align:start position:0%
behind me and I know we have a small
 
04:36:35.929 --> 04:36:35.939 align:start position:0%
room and we have a small audience today
 
04:36:38.750 --> 04:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
but there are fourteen thousand patients
 
04:36:41.570 --> 04:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
in the therapeutic cannabis program so
 
04:36:43.131 --> 04:36:43.141 align:start position:0%
we are here to say please let's look at
 
04:36:44.810 --> 04:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
these statutes we're going to be looking
 
04:36:47.209 --> 04:36:47.219 align:start position:0%
at them over the afternoon so what I've
 
04:36:49.369 --> 04:36:49.379 align:start position:0%
given you is um
 
04:36:51.709 --> 04:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
the area of law that we're going to be
 
04:36:54.410 --> 04:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
talking about and um and we're also
 
04:36:56.570 --> 04:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
going to be all asking you if you would
 
04:36:58.789 --> 04:36:58.799 align:start position:0%
be interested in sponsoring some kind of
 
04:37:00.590 --> 04:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
an educational event so that we can
 
04:37:02.631 --> 04:37:02.641 align:start position:0%
teach the rest of the legislatures what
 
04:37:04.551 --> 04:37:04.561 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
04:37:06.709 --> 04:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
yes representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
04:37:10.910 --> 04:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
chair and make this brief back to
 
04:37:13.070 --> 04:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
represent Weber's if I understand that's
 
04:37:14.269 --> 04:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to accomplish through
 
04:37:17.209 --> 04:37:17.219 align:start position:0%
this bill is what you can do illegally
 
04:37:19.010 --> 04:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
if you will by going to the street to
 
04:37:21.170 --> 04:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
get cannabis you just which could be a
 
04:37:23.990 --> 04:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
funky source of the product to turn it
 
04:37:26.209 --> 04:37:26.219 align:start position:0%
into a legal way to get it from a legal
 
04:37:28.010 --> 04:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
Source that's controlled and has better
 
04:37:29.570 --> 04:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
safety for the patient so you can still
 
04:37:31.849 --> 04:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
get cannabis all this is doing allowing
 
04:37:34.609 --> 04:37:34.619 align:start position:0%
the patient to go to some place that has
 
04:37:36.230 --> 04:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
some sort of assurance about the quality
 
04:37:41.390 --> 04:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:45.470 --> 04:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
I find that the 100 I find that I know
 
04:37:48.051 --> 04:37:48.061 align:start position:0%
every ingredient that's going into my
 
04:37:48.061 --> 04:37:49.010 align:start position:0%
every ingredient that's going into my
mouth

04:37:49.010 --> 04:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
mouth
 
04:37:52.789 --> 04:37:52.799 align:start position:0%
that it's you know versus a generic drug
 
04:37:55.551 --> 04:37:55.561 align:start position:0%
which now I worked in Psychiatry with
 
04:37:57.529 --> 04:37:57.539 align:start position:0%
doctors for a long period of time and I
 
04:37:59.330 --> 04:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
won't mention agencies or names or
 
04:38:01.551 --> 04:38:01.561 align:start position:0%
anything like that but when you look at
 
04:38:03.349 --> 04:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
the medications and you wonder what the
 
04:38:05.390 --> 04:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
standard deviation is for the medication
 
04:38:08.689 --> 04:38:08.699 align:start position:0%
across the board if I if I so for
 
04:38:11.150 --> 04:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
instance if I had a Latuda then that
 
04:38:14.029 --> 04:38:14.039 align:start position:0%
pill has a standard deviation of being
 
04:38:18.051 --> 04:38:18.061 align:start position:0%
the same as another drug of 97 point so
 
04:38:20.570 --> 04:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
two I think 5 or 2.5 percent I forget
 
04:38:24.349 --> 04:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
how that goes but 97.5 percent of those
 
04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
bills are those pills are exactly the
 
04:38:32.029 --> 04:38:32.039 align:start position:0%
same or 102.5 percent of those pills so
 
04:38:35.209 --> 04:38:35.219 align:start position:0%
somewhere along those that five
 
04:38:37.551 --> 04:38:37.561 align:start position:0%
Point deviation you know you're getting
 
04:38:39.590 --> 04:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
something pure
 
04:38:44.689 --> 04:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
for generic medications it's 85.
 
04:38:48.051 --> 04:38:48.061 align:start position:0%
85 percent consistently across the
 
04:38:49.970 --> 04:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
medications a pharmaceutical
 
04:38:52.730 --> 04:38:52.740 align:start position:0%
manufacturer can change the compounds
 
04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
that they use that they add the
 
04:38:56.510 --> 04:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
stabilizers the the things that keep
 
04:38:58.609 --> 04:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
that drug in the form that they put it
 
04:39:00.709 --> 04:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
there and keep it measurable to deliver
 
04:39:03.170 --> 04:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
it to your body so would you want to
 
04:39:05.330 --> 04:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
take something that's 85 percent what
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
you are looking for in a drug that has a
 
04:39:09.830 --> 04:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
hundred other compounds in it that you
 
04:39:11.330 --> 04:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
don't know what they are and where they
 
04:39:13.131 --> 04:39:13.141 align:start position:0%
came from or would you rather take
 
04:39:14.929 --> 04:39:14.939 align:start position:0%
something that was sourced from a
 
04:39:17.510 --> 04:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
dispensary up the street that actually
 
04:39:19.609 --> 04:39:19.619 align:start position:0%
relies on its own grow house and never
 
04:39:22.631 --> 04:39:22.641 align:start position:0%
accept products from outside of of their
 
04:39:25.449 --> 04:39:25.459 align:start position:0%
supervision directly
 
04:39:29.510 --> 04:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay oh yes representative Cobalt
 
04:39:30.949 --> 04:39:30.959 align:start position:0%
um just looking at the bill and hearing
 
04:39:32.330 --> 04:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
04:39:32.340 --> 04:39:33.051 align:start position:0%
your testimony
um

04:39:33.051 --> 04:39:33.061 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:37.670 --> 04:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
I I guess I I it looks to me as if this
 
04:39:40.730 --> 04:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
is really a simple matter of affording
 
04:39:44.090 --> 04:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
Physicians the freedom to exercise their
 
04:39:46.010 --> 04:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
practice with their best professional
 
04:39:48.590 --> 04:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
judgment so I think it's probably a
 
04:39:50.868 --> 04:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
short yes or no answer uh would you
 
04:39:52.250 --> 04:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
would you agree with that that statement
 
04:39:54.410 --> 04:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
that this is really about Physicians uh
 
04:39:55.970 --> 04:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
being free to exercise their
 
04:39:59.570 --> 04:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:02.930 --> 04:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
that's a really tough one to answer for
 
04:40:05.810 --> 04:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
me because when I tried to get organized
 
04:40:08.448 --> 04:40:08.458 align:start position:0%
for today I we have a doctor here who's
 
04:40:10.010 --> 04:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
from the therapeutic cannabis medical
 
04:40:11.690 --> 04:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
oversight board
 
04:40:14.448 --> 04:40:14.458 align:start position:0%
and he can speak to what it's like to
 
04:40:17.208 --> 04:40:17.218 align:start position:0%
for being what this would
 
04:40:20.448 --> 04:40:20.458 align:start position:0%
be for him okay so I don't know if what
 
04:40:22.490 --> 04:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
this is sending doctors I don't know the
 
04:40:23.750 --> 04:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
message it's sending them but it's
 
04:40:25.730 --> 04:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
sending the patients the message that
 
04:40:27.708 --> 04:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
they don't have to try all these other
 
04:40:30.890 --> 04:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
radical methods and honestly opiates are
 
04:40:33.650 --> 04:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
radical that's a radical decision to
 
04:40:36.110 --> 04:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
take and and you never think that you're
 
04:40:37.490 --> 04:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
going to be taking it for the rest of
 
04:40:39.170 --> 04:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
your life when you take that first one
 
04:40:40.910 --> 04:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
and then that's where you could be
 
04:40:47.448 --> 04:40:47.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:49.250 --> 04:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
see no other questions
 
04:40:51.890 --> 04:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you I'm sorry for
 
04:40:53.690 --> 04:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
all my stammering and hopefully I got a
 
04:40:58.930 --> 04:40:58.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:01.190 --> 04:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak today is
 
04:41:04.310 --> 04:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:06.050 --> 04:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
representative if he could hold it to
 
04:41:11.170 --> 04:41:11.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:13.610 --> 04:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
04:41:15.110 --> 04:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
committee I'm representative Wendy
 
04:41:16.670 --> 04:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
Thomas and I represent the town of
 
04:41:19.430 --> 04:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
Merrimack I'm also a therapeutic patient
 
04:41:21.530 --> 04:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
and have worked with patients in a
 
04:41:23.810 --> 04:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
dispensary I'm going to focus on the
 
04:41:26.990 --> 04:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
opioid part of this
 
04:41:29.570 --> 04:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I'm I'm going to focus on
 
04:41:32.270 --> 04:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
the opioid um part of this uh problem
 
04:41:35.868 --> 04:41:35.878 align:start position:0%
that this bill as is be the bill that
 
04:41:38.208 --> 04:41:38.218 align:start position:0%
stands before this one offers
 
04:41:39.530 --> 04:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
um when I recently had some major
 
04:41:42.050 --> 04:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
surgery I was sent home with a total of
 
04:41:45.170 --> 04:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
seven opioid pills with the instructions
 
04:41:47.930 --> 04:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
to take two every four hours that was
 
04:41:49.628 --> 04:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
pain relief for 12 and a half hours
 
04:41:52.490 --> 04:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
that's following major surgery
 
04:41:55.128 --> 04:41:55.138 align:start position:0%
when I developed a painful complication
 
04:41:56.930 --> 04:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
I was told that quote we do not
 
04:41:59.390 --> 04:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
prescribe narcotics after surgery end of
 
04:41:59.400 --> 04:42:00.230 align:start position:0%
prescribe narcotics after surgery end of
quote

04:42:00.230 --> 04:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
quote
 
04:42:02.628 --> 04:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
when I had a second major operation this
 
04:42:04.490 --> 04:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
time in order to be sent home with pain
 
04:42:06.590 --> 04:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
medication I had to fill out a
 
04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
psychological profile and I had to sign
 
04:42:10.670 --> 04:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
a three-page agreement that said among
 
04:42:13.430 --> 04:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
other things that I could get addicted
 
04:42:15.590 --> 04:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
and that I could not sell the pills on
 
04:42:16.670 --> 04:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
the street
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
this time I was sent home with five
 
04:42:21.650 --> 04:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
pills with the instruction to take one
 
04:42:24.470 --> 04:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
every four hours that was 20 hours of
 
04:42:26.448 --> 04:42:26.458 align:start position:0%
pain relief again following major
 
04:42:26.458 --> 04:42:27.590 align:start position:0%
pain relief again following major
surgery

04:42:27.590 --> 04:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
surgery
 
04:42:30.170 --> 04:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
the issue of under medicating patients
 
04:42:32.150 --> 04:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
in severe pain is a discussion for
 
04:42:33.368 --> 04:42:33.378 align:start position:0%
another day
 
04:42:36.410 --> 04:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
opioids and even small doses have a big
 
04:42:39.230 --> 04:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
impact on the body symptoms of opioid
 
04:42:41.208 --> 04:42:41.218 align:start position:0%
use include drowsiness constipation
 
04:42:43.970 --> 04:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
Euphoria nausea vomiting and slowed
 
04:42:46.610 --> 04:42:46.620 align:start position:0%
breathing a person using opioids over
 
04:42:48.350 --> 04:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
time can develop tolerance physical
 
04:42:51.590 --> 04:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
dependence and opioid use disorder with
 
04:42:54.530 --> 04:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
the risk of Overdose and death this is
 
04:42:57.350 --> 04:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
nothing new we especially as legislators
 
04:42:59.990 --> 04:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
are well aware of the opioid epidemic in
 
04:43:01.670 --> 04:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:43:04.970 --> 04:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
in the case of severe pain often it is
 
04:43:08.330 --> 04:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
chronic or lifelong opioid medication is
 
04:43:11.270 --> 04:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
not going to fix it it is only going to
 
04:43:12.770 --> 04:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
mask it for a while
 
04:43:15.110 --> 04:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
the danger of not passing this bill is
 
04:43:17.330 --> 04:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
that some patients will be asked to use
 
04:43:20.690 --> 04:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
opioids to prove that it doesn't work
 
04:43:22.970 --> 04:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
following current trends it is very
 
04:43:24.830 --> 04:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
likely that those patients will be under
 
04:43:27.170 --> 04:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
medicated with opioid medication for
 
04:43:28.250 --> 04:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
their pain
 
04:43:30.530 --> 04:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
that's when we get into trouble
 
04:43:32.690 --> 04:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
many of these under medicated patients
 
04:43:35.570 --> 04:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
turn to alcohol or even street drugs in
 
04:43:37.850 --> 04:43:37.860 align:start position:0%
an effort to manage their pain
 
04:43:40.250 --> 04:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
cannabis provides a safe alternative to
 
04:43:43.070 --> 04:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
pain medication to pain management and
 
04:43:44.990 --> 04:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
it does not have the side effects or
 
04:43:47.448 --> 04:43:47.458 align:start position:0%
addictive qualities of opioids
 
04:43:49.730 --> 04:43:49.740 align:start position:0%
if the largest Health provider in New
 
04:43:51.050 --> 04:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is so concerned about
 
04:43:53.510 --> 04:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
addiction and abuse with opioids that
 
04:43:55.430 --> 04:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
they send their patients home with very
 
04:43:58.010 --> 04:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
few opioid pills and make us sign
 
04:44:01.010 --> 04:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
contracts of use the idea of tying
 
04:44:04.190 --> 04:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
opioids for severe chronic pain before
 
04:44:07.128 --> 04:44:07.138 align:start position:0%
trying cannabis is illogical and does
 
04:44:08.690 --> 04:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
not fit with the current prescription
 
04:44:11.990 --> 04:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
and usage of opioids I urge you to pass
 
04:44:14.930 --> 04:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
house bills 611 so that our severe pain
 
04:44:18.170 --> 04:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
patients can if they choose opt for a
 
04:44:20.270 --> 04:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
safer method of pain management without
 
04:44:22.730 --> 04:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
having to go through the use of addicted
 
04:44:26.810 --> 04:44:26.820 align:start position:0%
addictive opioids to get there sorry
 
04:44:29.330 --> 04:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll take any questions thank
 
04:44:32.270 --> 04:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:34.128 --> 04:44:34.138 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions
 
04:44:35.448 --> 04:44:35.458 align:start position:0%

04:45:07.970 --> 04:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
hb611 uh because I support this bill I'm
 
04:45:10.430 --> 04:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
currently a member of the therapeutic
 
04:45:13.550 --> 04:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis program as I have just recently
 
04:45:15.910 --> 04:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh enrolled in that program
 
04:45:19.850 --> 04:45:19.860 align:start position:0%
I broke my back first when I was uh 16
 
04:45:22.970 --> 04:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
years old in 2016. I had an L4 burst
 
04:45:26.570 --> 04:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
fracture I had a spinal fusion and I was
 
04:45:29.090 --> 04:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
prescribed several opiates I remember
 
04:45:32.090 --> 04:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
being in the hospital uh when I was on
 
04:45:32.100 --> 04:45:33.948 align:start position:0%
being in the hospital uh when I was on
uh

04:45:33.948 --> 04:45:33.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:37.070 --> 04:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
medicinal grade Fentanyl and the nurses
 
04:45:38.330 --> 04:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
would either have to remind me how to
 
04:45:42.410 --> 04:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
breathe or I'd be screaming in pain
 
04:45:45.410 --> 04:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't necessarily focus on
 
04:45:47.330 --> 04:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
the opiate side of things but it isn't
 
04:45:49.970 --> 04:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
all it allows for Alternatives I spent
 
04:45:51.788 --> 04:45:51.798 align:start position:0%
years dealing with my pain
 
04:45:54.470 --> 04:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
and previously prescribed medications
 
04:45:57.590 --> 04:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
had not worked I'd gone through several
 
04:46:00.410 --> 04:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
um and I had gone through surgical
 
04:46:03.890 --> 04:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
measures such as a spinal injection
 
04:46:06.110 --> 04:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
those treatments didn't work for me
 
04:46:10.490 --> 04:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
but medicinal cannabis has uh it's
 
04:46:11.990 --> 04:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
something where I think that this could
 
04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
definitely provide a lot of support and
 
04:46:16.010 --> 04:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
assistance for people who need it thank
 
04:46:17.690 --> 04:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
you I'll take any questions
 
04:46:22.190 --> 04:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:24.530 --> 04:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
I'm saying no questions okay thank you
 
04:46:29.510 --> 04:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:31.730 --> 04:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is if I'm a
 
04:46:34.670 --> 04:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative Jerry can Eric
 
04:46:34.680 --> 04:46:54.708 align:start position:0%
representative Jerry can Eric
foreign

04:46:54.708 --> 04:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:56.628 --> 04:46:56.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um for the record
 
04:46:59.090 --> 04:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
again Jerry can Eric uh former State Rep
 
04:47:00.650 --> 04:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
and chair of the therapeutic canvas
 
04:47:03.050 --> 04:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board which is charged
 
04:47:04.490 --> 04:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
with the medical oversight of the
 
04:47:06.650 --> 04:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program again just
 
04:47:08.570 --> 04:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
to review 10 medical providers from
 
04:47:10.730 --> 04:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
different fields a patient
 
04:47:10.740 --> 04:47:12.190 align:start position:0%
different fields a patient
representative

04:47:12.190 --> 04:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:47:16.310 --> 04:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
the medical director of the DHHS and a
 
04:47:17.448 --> 04:47:17.458 align:start position:0%
representative from an alternative
 
04:47:19.970 --> 04:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
treatment center
 
04:47:22.430 --> 04:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
um as I said earlier about 70 of our
 
04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
patients are certified for treating pain
 
04:47:25.550 --> 04:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
allowing them to lessen or avoid the use
 
04:47:27.650 --> 04:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
of opioids and about 82 percent of
 
04:47:29.150 --> 04:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients in New
 
04:47:30.350 --> 04:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire report that they have been
 
04:47:31.670 --> 04:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
able to decrease their prescription
 
04:47:33.650 --> 04:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
medications a couple of things to
 
04:47:34.730 --> 04:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
clarify because there's been a little
 
04:47:36.948 --> 04:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
bit of confusion about how you get in
 
04:47:38.510 --> 04:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
this program to enroll you have to be
 
04:47:40.430 --> 04:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
certified by your medical providers
 
04:47:41.930 --> 04:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
having a qualified medical condition
 
04:47:44.270 --> 04:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
established in law you don't prescribe
 
04:47:45.830 --> 04:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis you can't do it because it's a
 
04:47:47.990 --> 04:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
schedule one drug but you certify have a
 
04:47:49.550 --> 04:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
qualifying condition
 
04:47:51.470 --> 04:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
representative Weber hit the nail on the
 
04:47:51.480 --> 04:47:52.250 align:start position:0%
representative Weber hit the nail on the
head

04:47:52.250 --> 04:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
head
 
04:47:54.590 --> 04:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
it's hb611 seeks to remove an
 
04:47:57.410 --> 04:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and potentially harmful step
 
04:47:59.330 --> 04:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
in a patient becoming qualified to use
 
04:48:00.890 --> 04:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis for pain it's
 
04:48:03.708 --> 04:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
almost like I sent you my my testimony
 
04:48:05.750 --> 04:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
currently a patient can qualify for
 
04:48:07.850 --> 04:48:07.860 align:start position:0%
severe pain only after having failed to
 
04:48:09.288 --> 04:48:09.298 align:start position:0%
respond to previously prescribed
 
04:48:11.270 --> 04:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
medication or surgical measures or
 
04:48:13.430 --> 04:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
whether treatment options give
 
04:48:15.890 --> 04:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
unnecessary or serious side effects
 
04:48:18.830 --> 04:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
but this barrier is not needed in
 
04:48:21.470 --> 04:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
December 2022 meeting tcmov voted
 
04:48:24.890 --> 04:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
unanimously to support HB 611 as it is
 
04:48:27.830 --> 04:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
written to remove this unneeded barrier
 
04:48:29.810 --> 04:48:29.820 align:start position:0%
now the statutes are a little confusing
 
04:48:31.250 --> 04:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
and there were some questions about this
 
04:48:34.490 --> 04:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
as to how you can how you qualify part
 
04:48:35.930 --> 04:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
of that is because of the structure and
 
04:48:37.610 --> 04:48:37.620 align:start position:0%
part of this because of having added in
 
04:48:39.530 --> 04:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
other standalones over time
 
04:48:41.690 --> 04:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
you have to have both a both a
 
04:48:44.868 --> 04:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
qualifying condition and a qualifying
 
04:48:48.190 --> 04:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
symptom that's the RSA
 
04:48:51.410 --> 04:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
126x19a1 and 2. but there are also a
 
04:48:52.910 --> 04:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
number of Standalone conditions that
 
04:48:54.890 --> 04:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
we've put in over the years one of which
 
04:48:56.690 --> 04:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
again is severe pain
 
04:48:58.670 --> 04:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
but one of the qualifying symptoms is
 
04:49:00.410 --> 04:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
listed as quote severe pain that has not
 
04:49:01.788 --> 04:49:01.798 align:start position:0%
responded to previously prescribed
 
04:49:03.530 --> 04:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
medication or surgical measures or for
 
04:49:04.970 --> 04:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
which other treatment options produce
 
04:49:06.650 --> 04:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
serious side effects end quote this
 
04:49:08.650 --> 04:49:08.660 align:start position:0%
exact language is then in the second
 
04:49:11.868 --> 04:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
Standalone condition as well that is why
 
04:49:14.448 --> 04:49:14.458 align:start position:0%
you see in this bill that there are two
 
04:49:17.510 --> 04:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
sets of strikethroughs one strikes the
 
04:49:22.070 --> 04:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
qualifying symptom for the 126x9 Roman
 
04:49:25.368 --> 04:49:25.378 align:start position:0%
nine A1 and 2 and the other one strikes
 
04:49:28.368 --> 04:49:28.378 align:start position:0%
the Standalone condition restriction
 
04:49:30.708 --> 04:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
now remember that when the therapeutic
 
04:49:33.310 --> 04:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis program was established in 2013
 
04:49:36.170 --> 04:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
our evidence regarding efficacy of
 
04:49:38.690 --> 04:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis was still evolving
 
04:49:40.490 --> 04:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
the statute was written to make
 
04:49:42.410 --> 04:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis an option of Last
 
04:49:45.050 --> 04:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
Resort in treating pain
 
04:49:47.150 --> 04:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
we now know that that's no longer
 
04:49:49.430 --> 04:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate some of the strongest
 
04:49:51.170 --> 04:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
evidence we have for the efficacy of
 
04:49:52.850 --> 04:49:52.860 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis is for the
 
04:49:54.470 --> 04:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
treatment of pain
 
04:49:56.510 --> 04:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
and The Landmark National Academy is a
 
04:49:59.270 --> 04:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
science study in 2016 concluded again
 
04:50:01.010 --> 04:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
that there's substantial evidence that
 
04:50:02.750 --> 04:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis is an effective treatment for
 
04:50:04.610 --> 04:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
chronic pain in adults
 
04:50:07.128 --> 04:50:07.138 align:start position:0%
so given the Cannabis has proven to be
 
04:50:09.590 --> 04:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
effective in treating pain it is not
 
04:50:12.110 --> 04:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable at this point in time to
 
04:50:14.510 --> 04:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
continue to insist that a patient has to
 
04:50:17.330 --> 04:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
fail other options which may have poor
 
04:50:19.490 --> 04:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
evidence of efficacy or which carry
 
04:50:21.708 --> 04:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
risks which actually exceed the risks of
 
04:50:23.628 --> 04:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
04:50:25.430 --> 04:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
as I said before I was a spine surgeon
 
04:50:27.288 --> 04:50:27.298 align:start position:0%
and though there are some spinal
 
04:50:28.730 --> 04:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
problems that respond well to surgery
 
04:50:30.708 --> 04:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
most of the time if you got a problem
 
04:50:31.850 --> 04:50:31.860 align:start position:0%
with your back you should run the other
 
04:50:33.770 --> 04:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
way from a guy with a knife because many
 
04:50:35.390 --> 04:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
of our surgical procedures are really
 
04:50:36.890 --> 04:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
not helpful they're not likely to make
 
04:50:38.990 --> 04:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
people better so why would you force a
 
04:50:40.430 --> 04:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
patient to have that procedure before
 
04:50:42.530 --> 04:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
you could say sure you can have cannabis
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
or why force a patient to do a trial of
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
opioids for their back pain before
 
04:50:50.570 --> 04:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
trying therapeutic cannabis we know that
 
04:50:52.910 --> 04:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
opioids are not the not often are not
 
04:50:54.830 --> 04:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
effective for long-term management of
 
04:50:57.230 --> 04:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
pain and have far more risk of addiction
 
04:50:59.868 --> 04:50:59.878 align:start position:0%
and impairment than cannabis does
 
04:51:01.850 --> 04:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
no reason to expose the patient to that
 
04:51:04.128 --> 04:51:04.138 align:start position:0%
risk of addiction and impairment from an
 
04:51:07.250 --> 04:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
opioid if it can be avoided and this by
 
04:51:08.390 --> 04:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
the way doesn't have a whole lot to do
 
04:51:10.610 --> 04:51:10.620 align:start position:0%
with acute post-operative pain because
 
04:51:12.288 --> 04:51:12.298 align:start position:0%
first of all it takes some time to be
 
04:51:14.270 --> 04:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
certified go through the patient or
 
04:51:15.948 --> 04:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
through the program so it's really
 
04:51:17.750 --> 04:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
basically not an acute pain issue this
 
04:51:19.310 --> 04:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
is for somebody yes I've got one more
 
04:51:21.650 --> 04:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
sentence for somebody who is
 
04:51:24.830 --> 04:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
um who is uh has severe opinions not for
 
04:51:27.590 --> 04:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
post-op pain so I urge you to pass 611
 
04:51:30.530 --> 04:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
to remove an unneeded barrier to a
 
04:51:32.270 --> 04:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
proven treatment for pain which is just
 
04:51:33.890 --> 04:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
an historical barrier that doesn't need
 
04:51:35.150 --> 04:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
to be there thank you and I'll take
 
04:51:37.430 --> 04:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much uh
 
04:51:40.010 --> 04:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
04:51:42.948 --> 04:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
continuing on the drafting theme and
 
04:51:45.350 --> 04:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
following up on a question asked by
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
04:51:47.760 --> 04:51:48.410 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
um

04:51:48.410 --> 04:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:52.368 --> 04:51:52.378 align:start position:0%
to be qualifying medical condition also
 
04:51:55.670 --> 04:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
means one moderate to severe chronic
 
04:51:58.190 --> 04:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
pain and then two the piece that we're
 
04:52:01.030 --> 04:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
modifying the severe pain that has not
 
04:52:03.288 --> 04:52:03.298 align:start position:0%
responded to prescriptions but as long
 
04:52:06.770 --> 04:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
as we are putting severe pain that is
 
04:52:09.650 --> 04:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
not necessarily chronic on exactly the
 
04:52:13.128 --> 04:52:13.138 align:start position:0%
same footing as chronic pain would it
 
04:52:16.850 --> 04:52:16.860 align:start position:0%
make sense to delete uh number two
 
04:52:21.410 --> 04:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
entirely and remove the word chronic
 
04:52:25.670 --> 04:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
from number one so it just said moderate
 
04:52:28.490 --> 04:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
to severe pain and then we don't have to
 
04:52:30.830 --> 04:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
discuss whether it's chronic or acute or
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
or other things
 
04:52:35.448 --> 04:52:35.458 align:start position:0%
if you look at my notes from our tcmob
 
04:52:37.670 --> 04:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
meetings we discussed this these various
 
04:52:39.230 --> 04:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
structures and ways to do it and that
 
04:52:41.030 --> 04:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
did come up as one of our options of
 
04:52:42.890 --> 04:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
just trying to collapse it
 
04:52:44.628 --> 04:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
we thought that would be a little bit of
 
04:52:46.910 --> 04:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
a bigger lift because the one was really
 
04:52:48.770 --> 04:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
speaking about chronic pain and others
 
04:52:50.150 --> 04:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
speaking about severe which could be
 
04:52:52.850 --> 04:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
Subacute uh or you know pain that is of
 
04:52:55.730 --> 04:52:55.740 align:start position:0%
somewhat shorter duration and we decided
 
04:52:57.288 --> 04:52:57.298 align:start position:0%
that it made sense just to Simply remove
 
04:52:59.270 --> 04:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
the barrier rather than try to collapse
 
04:53:02.150 --> 04:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
the categories and get rid of it but I
 
04:53:03.770 --> 04:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
think that could be done that was one
 
04:53:06.288 --> 04:53:06.298 align:start position:0%
that we entertained
 
04:53:09.230 --> 04:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
could I have one follow-up follow-up if
 
04:53:11.750 --> 04:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
we did that would you see more
 
04:53:14.690 --> 04:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
um push back to this statute because my
 
04:53:17.030 --> 04:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
my goal would be to get something passed
 
04:53:17.040 --> 04:53:19.070 align:start position:0%
my goal would be to get something passed
but

04:53:19.070 --> 04:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:53:23.570 --> 04:53:23.580 align:start position:0%
as we've been dealing all day today with
 
04:53:27.350 --> 04:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
removing the barriers and inch by inch
 
04:53:29.448 --> 04:53:29.458 align:start position:0%
statutes that we put in in order to get
 
04:53:32.208 --> 04:53:32.218 align:start position:0%
something passed at all what I'm trying
 
04:53:35.530 --> 04:53:35.540 align:start position:0%
to find out is are we at the stage
 
04:53:38.990 --> 04:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
where we could just consolidate and I
 
04:53:40.368 --> 04:53:40.378 align:start position:0%
think what you're here I'm hearing you
 
04:53:43.010 --> 04:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
say is no we're not there yet well
 
04:53:43.020 --> 04:53:44.030 align:start position:0%
say is no we're not there yet well
actually

04:53:44.030 --> 04:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:53:46.788 --> 04:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
personally I I did like the idea of just
 
04:53:49.070 --> 04:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
consolidating it but I am here speaking
 
04:53:50.628 --> 04:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
for the board and the board voted to
 
04:53:53.628 --> 04:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
support this particular language but I
 
04:53:55.190 --> 04:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
was very comfortable with just
 
04:53:56.930 --> 04:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
collapsing those categories and still
 
04:54:01.310 --> 04:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
keeping it in the uh Roman nine A2
 
04:54:03.170 --> 04:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
because that one is a separate thing
 
04:54:05.570 --> 04:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
just deleting it but in the standalones
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
to combine one and two and then of
 
04:54:09.530 --> 04:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
course renumber the three four and five
 
04:54:10.910 --> 04:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
and six
 
04:54:12.288 --> 04:54:12.298 align:start position:0%
um and I think one could just say
 
04:54:14.570 --> 04:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
moderate to severe pain
 
04:54:16.970 --> 04:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
period I I would favor that but that is
 
04:54:18.230 --> 04:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
not what the board voted on in some
 
04:54:19.730 --> 04:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
sense speaking for them I need to report
 
04:54:21.890 --> 04:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
what the board voted on thank you for
 
04:54:23.750 --> 04:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
making the clarification thank you for
 
04:54:25.970 --> 04:54:25.980 align:start position:0%
giving us your opinion yes thank you
 
04:54:28.128 --> 04:54:28.138 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
04:54:30.410 --> 04:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative
 
04:54:32.090 --> 04:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
just so you know you're preaching the
 
04:54:33.350 --> 04:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
choir here
 
04:54:35.868 --> 04:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
um I want to imply otherwise with my
 
04:54:38.030 --> 04:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
previous question I
 
04:54:40.430 --> 04:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
um what's unfortunate what we're seeing
 
04:54:41.868 --> 04:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
is not what I see when I certify a
 
04:54:44.520 --> 04:54:45.770 align:start position:0%
is not what I see when I certify a
patient

04:54:45.770 --> 04:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
patient
 
04:54:48.050 --> 04:54:48.060 align:start position:0%
um when you see the form as presented to
 
04:54:50.330 --> 04:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
us it makes so much more sense and I
 
04:54:51.948 --> 04:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
actually like the way it is and I would
 
04:54:54.470 --> 04:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
not like to see it change personally I
 
04:54:56.208 --> 04:54:56.218 align:start position:0%
really hated it when I first saw it but
 
04:54:58.788 --> 04:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
now I really like it
 
04:55:01.070 --> 04:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
yeah may I
 
04:55:04.250 --> 04:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
okay I want your opinion yes I think in
 
04:55:06.530 --> 04:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
a way it kind of devolves back to what
 
04:55:08.330 --> 04:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
representative Koval said a moment ago
 
04:55:09.948 --> 04:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
it just leaves it that it gives the
 
04:55:12.530 --> 04:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
provider the opportunity to say I think
 
04:55:14.208 --> 04:55:14.218 align:start position:0%
this patient's a reasonable person to
 
04:55:16.010 --> 04:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
consider cannabis and they don't
 
04:55:17.510 --> 04:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to do a trial of
 
04:55:19.670 --> 04:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
something else although you know print
 
04:55:21.530 --> 04:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
off a lot of pain most any provider is
 
04:55:23.510 --> 04:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
going to try someone perhaps on Naprosyn
 
04:55:24.590 --> 04:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
or something before they're going to
 
04:55:26.510 --> 04:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
send them off a therapeutic cannabis and
 
04:55:28.550 --> 04:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
I think almost all providers would this
 
04:55:30.410 --> 04:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
just removes a barrier for the provider
 
04:55:33.230 --> 04:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
as representative Koval pointed out
 
04:55:35.030 --> 04:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:55:39.230 --> 04:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:40.670 --> 04:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:55:45.110 --> 04:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:47.270 --> 04:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Michael Holt
 
04:55:48.650 --> 04:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health and Human
 
04:55:48.660 --> 04:55:54.170 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health and Human
Services

04:55:54.170 --> 04:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:55.610 --> 04:55:55.620 align:start position:0%
and again if Sarah if you could hold it
 
04:55:58.010 --> 04:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
to five to three minutes please thank
 
04:55:59.448 --> 04:55:59.458 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair members of the committee
 
04:56:01.250 --> 04:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
I'll keep it to one minute
 
04:56:01.260 --> 04:56:02.990 align:start position:0%
I'll keep it to one minute
um

04:56:02.990 --> 04:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:04.788 --> 04:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
I have two points to make one is that
 
04:56:07.190 --> 04:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is as straightforward as uh it
 
04:56:09.530 --> 04:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
appears it removes a barrier to
 
04:56:09.540 --> 04:56:11.030 align:start position:0%
appears it removes a barrier to
Providers

04:56:11.030 --> 04:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
Providers
 
04:56:13.430 --> 04:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
um for uh certifying their patients for
 
04:56:15.530 --> 04:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis program and I would just
 
04:56:18.590 --> 04:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
like to confirm as the administrator of
 
04:56:20.390 --> 04:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program for the
 
04:56:23.330 --> 04:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
past you know five six years
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
um this is a conversation that we have
 
04:56:27.410 --> 04:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis with medical
 
04:56:29.090 --> 04:56:29.100 align:start position:0%
providers when they have questions about
 
04:56:31.190 --> 04:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
certification and they will ask us
 
04:56:33.230 --> 04:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
specifically according to this standard
 
04:56:35.510 --> 04:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
do we have to have surgery or a course
 
04:56:37.670 --> 04:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
of opioids first and technically the
 
04:56:39.470 --> 04:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
answer the answer is yes
 
04:56:41.270 --> 04:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
um and that and that does act as a
 
04:56:43.788 --> 04:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
barrier for some patients certification
 
04:56:45.890 --> 04:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer questions about the
 
04:56:45.900 --> 04:56:47.150 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer questions about the
program

04:56:47.150 --> 04:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:56:48.890 --> 04:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
um as well but I just want to make the
 
04:56:50.150 --> 04:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
point that this is uh can be
 
04:56:52.610 --> 04:56:52.620 align:start position:0%
operationalized by the the the the state
 
04:56:54.650 --> 04:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
and we have no objections to this uh
 
04:56:55.730 --> 04:56:55.740 align:start position:0%
this change
 
04:57:00.708 --> 04:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:07.250 --> 04:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:20.570 --> 04:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:25.010 --> 04:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:26.930 --> 04:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you ladies
 
04:57:28.610 --> 04:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
and gentlemen of the board
 
04:57:30.708 --> 04:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh my name is David Landry I'm from
 
04:57:33.170 --> 04:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough New Hampshire I currently
 
04:57:36.170 --> 04:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
live closer to the microphone I'm sorry
 
04:57:38.810 --> 04:57:38.820 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you my name is David
 
04:57:40.390 --> 04:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
Landry I'm from Hillsboro New Hampshire
 
04:57:43.190 --> 04:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh I currently am employed for Prime
 
04:57:45.530 --> 04:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment center uh in
 
04:57:48.770 --> 04:57:48.780 align:start position:0%
Chichester and uh
 
04:57:51.170 --> 04:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
Prime does support this bill however I
 
04:57:53.830 --> 04:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
am here today to represent myself as a
 
04:57:56.270 --> 04:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
patient of the therapeutic cannabis
 
04:58:01.670 --> 04:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
program I support bill hb611 because I
 
04:58:02.810 --> 04:58:02.820 align:start position:0%
believe that everyone should have
 
04:58:04.788 --> 04:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
options on how to treat their symptoms
 
04:58:07.310 --> 04:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
and conditions I became a patient over
 
04:58:10.670 --> 04:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
six years ago when I first went into the
 
04:58:12.230 --> 04:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
dispensary I was looking for something
 
04:58:14.390 --> 04:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
to treat my severe pain little did I
 
04:58:16.490 --> 04:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
know that canvas would ensure that I
 
04:58:18.350 --> 04:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
would reach my end goal of detoxing for
 
04:58:25.010 --> 04:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
opiates and that was a huge Factor uh
 
04:58:27.530 --> 04:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
in my life and and how great my life is
 
04:58:29.990 --> 04:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
now I had I had the option of cannabis
 
04:58:33.170 --> 04:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
or opiates uh my life over opiates would
 
04:58:35.090 --> 04:58:35.100 align:start position:0%
have been my life would have been very
 
04:58:37.730 --> 04:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
different uh everyone should have the
 
04:58:40.128 --> 04:58:40.138 align:start position:0%
ability to decide whether or not they
 
04:58:41.930 --> 04:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
want to use Pharmaceuticals or
 
04:58:44.270 --> 04:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment methods no one
 
04:58:46.190 --> 04:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
should tell you that one treatment
 
04:58:48.708 --> 04:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
method has to fail before you can try
 
04:58:51.590 --> 04:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
another another
 
04:58:56.570 --> 04:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:59.270 --> 04:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
removing the the language from the bill
 
04:59:03.470 --> 04:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
would help providers uh
 
04:59:05.750 --> 04:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
have an easier time certifying patients
 
04:59:07.788 --> 04:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
and I think that right now we're we're
 
04:59:10.250 --> 04:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
having a really hard time with providers
 
04:59:13.610 --> 04:59:13.620 align:start position:0%
uh in fear of losing their license or or
 
04:59:16.128 --> 04:59:16.138 align:start position:0%
things like that any repercussions from
 
04:59:19.910 --> 04:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
this so this program has changed my life
 
04:59:21.770 --> 04:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
immensely and and I'm really grateful
 
04:59:23.930 --> 04:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
for that so I appreciate you all
 
04:59:25.670 --> 04:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
listening to me today thank you thank
 
04:59:26.810 --> 04:59:26.820 align:start position:0%
you don't take any questions should we
 
04:59:29.090 --> 04:59:29.100 align:start position:0%
get a copy of that testimony yes
 
04:59:31.430 --> 04:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
any questions for this gentleman
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative Mr chairman thanks
 
04:59:36.050 --> 04:59:36.060 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I I'm not totally
 
04:59:38.448 --> 04:59:38.458 align:start position:0%
sure how to ask this of you because it
 
04:59:40.850 --> 04:59:40.860 align:start position:0%
just came to my mind so if you come in
 
04:59:43.310 --> 04:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
to see me with a pain problem I write a
 
04:59:45.170 --> 04:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
script you go to the pharmacy it's right
 
04:59:47.330 --> 04:59:47.340 align:start position:0%
there one of the barriers that I see and
 
04:59:49.010 --> 04:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
I'm curious how this may have affected
 
04:59:51.288 --> 04:59:51.298 align:start position:0%
you as ice decide I want to certify you
 
04:59:53.390 --> 04:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
I write a form that goes to HH or
 
04:59:54.708 --> 04:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
whomever the Cannabis commission they
 
04:59:56.690 --> 04:59:56.700 align:start position:0%
have to decide blah blah blah we used to
 
04:59:59.090 --> 04:59:59.100 align:start position:0%
take months to get here back
 
05:00:00.470 --> 05:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
um you know so now you've dealt with
 
05:00:02.030 --> 05:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
pain for several months and we're
 
05:00:04.850 --> 05:00:04.860 align:start position:0%
talking about an acute issue here
 
05:00:06.770 --> 05:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
um what was your time frame before you
 
05:00:12.650 --> 05:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
got certified okay so in my in my um
 
05:00:16.850 --> 05:00:16.860 align:start position:0%
for me I had to have a three to six
 
05:00:19.128 --> 05:00:19.138 align:start position:0%
month patient doctor-patient
 
05:00:22.788 --> 05:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
relationship which is now no longer in
 
05:00:25.970 --> 05:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
existence which I I believe is great for
 
05:00:28.610 --> 05:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
this program uh so I had to have a
 
05:00:31.128 --> 05:00:31.138 align:start position:0%
three-month uh doctor-patient
 
05:00:34.490 --> 05:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
relationship uh at the time I had severe
 
05:00:38.990 --> 05:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
pain I was also 15 years plus of severe
 
05:00:43.010 --> 05:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
opiate addiction uh the doctor knew that
 
05:00:45.590 --> 05:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
I was trying to
 
05:00:50.330 --> 05:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
um get away from opiates and the doctor
 
05:00:50.340 --> 05:00:51.050 align:start position:0%
um get away from opiates and the doctor
um

05:00:51.050 --> 05:00:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:54.230 --> 05:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
told me after three months of of being
 
05:00:56.330 --> 05:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
her patient that we could then discuss
 
05:00:58.850 --> 05:00:58.860 align:start position:0%
entering this program which
 
05:00:58.860 --> 05:01:00.110 align:start position:0%
entering this program which
is

05:01:00.110 --> 05:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:01:00.120 --> 05:01:01.250 align:start position:0%
is
um

05:01:01.250 --> 05:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:04.128 --> 05:01:04.138 align:start position:0%
is what we ended up going with
 
05:01:07.850 --> 05:01:07.860 align:start position:0%
um but it was a long time I did have a
 
05:01:11.570 --> 05:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
extremely hard time uh coping with with
 
05:01:14.570 --> 05:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
my pain I but I did
 
05:01:18.368 --> 05:01:18.378 align:start position:0%
like I said I had an addiction I was
 
05:01:21.830 --> 05:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
using the black market I was gaming the
 
05:01:24.590 --> 05:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
system uh and
 
05:01:27.430 --> 05:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
finally ended up in a methadone program
 
05:01:30.230 --> 05:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
and after
 
05:01:33.410 --> 05:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
so many years of feeling ill from the
 
05:01:35.750 --> 05:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
amount of opiates I was taking and
 
05:01:37.610 --> 05:01:37.620 align:start position:0%
almost overdosing and dying several
 
05:01:40.250 --> 05:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
times I decided it was time to really
 
05:01:42.770 --> 05:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
come clean with my provider and really
 
05:01:45.650 --> 05:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
tell her exactly what was going on with
 
05:01:48.948 --> 05:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
me in wanting the help now I had gone to
 
05:01:51.590 --> 05:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms before this and I was
 
05:01:54.410 --> 05:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
told that it's not going to kill you go
 
05:01:57.070 --> 05:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
away and unfortunately
 
05:02:00.170 --> 05:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
the space that I was in I was
 
05:02:02.208 --> 05:02:02.218 align:start position:0%
I had the
 
05:02:04.730 --> 05:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
a strong family that was supporting me
 
05:02:08.270 --> 05:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
and I
 
05:02:10.730 --> 05:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
I really wanted to kill myself at the
 
05:02:12.890 --> 05:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
time so it would have killed me had I
 
05:02:15.948 --> 05:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
not had the support system I have
 
05:02:18.110 --> 05:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm really grateful for this program
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
though and uh you know I think that if a
 
05:02:25.550 --> 05:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
provider has an easier uh method of of
 
05:02:29.330 --> 05:02:29.340 align:start position:0%
you know not prescribing this but you
 
05:02:31.190 --> 05:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
know making this a recommendation that I
 
05:02:33.110 --> 05:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
think it would be great
 
05:02:36.890 --> 05:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:39.050 --> 05:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions okay thank
 
05:02:42.830 --> 05:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:45.708 --> 05:02:45.718 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak today is Heather
 
05:02:51.350 --> 05:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:56.810 --> 05:02:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:59.448 --> 05:02:59.458 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon thank you all for
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
being here and willing to listen to this
 
05:03:04.850 --> 05:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is Heather Marie Brown
 
05:03:08.708 --> 05:03:08.718 align:start position:0%
I am the patient representative on the
 
05:03:11.448 --> 05:03:11.458 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
05:03:15.590 --> 05:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
board so basically I am the one person
 
05:03:18.590 --> 05:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
that represents the 14th approximately
 
05:03:22.250 --> 05:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
14 000 patients we have in the state and
 
05:03:24.288 --> 05:03:24.298 align:start position:0%
all of the future potential patients
 
05:03:26.390 --> 05:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
that we may welcome into the program in
 
05:03:29.990 --> 05:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
the future I am a thousand percent in
 
05:03:32.930 --> 05:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I personally think
 
05:03:35.990 --> 05:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
that this bill is long overdue I think
 
05:03:39.110 --> 05:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
that we could use some changes and some
 
05:03:41.150 --> 05:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
loosening of requirements and
 
05:03:41.160 --> 05:03:42.350 align:start position:0%
loosening of requirements and
restrictions

05:03:42.350 --> 05:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
05:03:45.288 --> 05:03:45.298 align:start position:0%
but in particular
 
05:03:45.298 --> 05:03:46.670 align:start position:0%
but in particular
um

05:03:46.670 --> 05:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
taking these barriers away is going to
 
05:03:54.288 --> 05:03:54.298 align:start position:0%
make a huge difference not only in how a
 
05:03:57.470 --> 05:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
provider can deal with their patient but
 
05:03:59.930 --> 05:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
also the type of relationship that the
 
05:04:01.850 --> 05:04:01.860 align:start position:0%
patient can have with their provider
 
05:04:05.030 --> 05:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
because as of right now it is still very
 
05:04:07.190 --> 05:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to sit down with a provider
 
05:04:10.250 --> 05:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
and have these conversations we have
 
05:04:12.708 --> 05:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
very few providers in the state that are
 
05:04:15.410 --> 05:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
even willing to certify and some of that
 
05:04:18.890 --> 05:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
is due to lack of Education or lack of
 
05:04:21.890 --> 05:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
knowledge or lack of understanding as
 
05:04:24.288 --> 05:04:24.298 align:start position:0%
far as what the qualifications are and
 
05:04:26.868 --> 05:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
the wording behind it this takes away
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
that barrier and honestly I do not
 
05:04:31.970 --> 05:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
believe that we should be forcing
 
05:04:35.868 --> 05:04:35.878 align:start position:0%
anybody to go through such Extreme
 
05:04:38.868 --> 05:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
Measures for their health when they
 
05:04:40.788 --> 05:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
should be responsible for making those
 
05:04:43.610 --> 05:04:43.620 align:start position:0%
choices on how they deal with their
 
05:04:44.770 --> 05:04:44.780 align:start position:0%
health care
 
05:04:46.810 --> 05:04:46.820 align:start position:0%
I myself
 
05:04:49.850 --> 05:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
had been
 
05:04:53.030 --> 05:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with issues due to back injuries
 
05:04:55.610 --> 05:04:55.620 align:start position:0%
and other injuries throughout my years
 
05:04:57.410 --> 05:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
throughout my youth I had a very rough
 
05:04:57.420 --> 05:04:58.850 align:start position:0%
throughout my youth I had a very rough
use

05:04:58.850 --> 05:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
use
 
05:04:58.860 --> 05:04:59.890 align:start position:0%
use
um

05:04:59.890 --> 05:04:59.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:03.050 --> 05:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
going through medical professionals led
 
05:05:05.990 --> 05:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
me unfortunately to develop an addiction
 
05:05:09.830 --> 05:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
which then in turn ruined my ability to
 
05:05:12.830 --> 05:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
be a contributing member of society and
 
05:05:15.590 --> 05:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
almost destroyed my ability to be a
 
05:05:17.990 --> 05:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
successful mother
 
05:05:20.990 --> 05:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
um therapeutic cannabis I fought very
 
05:05:25.430 --> 05:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
very hard for chronic pain severe
 
05:05:28.910 --> 05:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
moderate pain and PTSD to be added to
 
05:05:31.250 --> 05:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
the list of qualifications and I was
 
05:05:34.368 --> 05:05:34.378 align:start position:0%
grateful to see it happen
 
05:05:37.730 --> 05:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
um I was extremely worried about getting
 
05:05:41.030 --> 05:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
a therapeutic cannabis card for chronic
 
05:05:43.628 --> 05:05:43.638 align:start position:0%
pain has a condition on its own because
 
05:05:46.128 --> 05:05:46.138 align:start position:0%
the medical professionals I was working
 
05:05:48.288 --> 05:05:48.298 align:start position:0%
with at the time wanted to force me into
 
05:05:51.670 --> 05:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
surgery that could have potentially
 
05:05:55.310 --> 05:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
caused me not to be able to walk they
 
05:05:58.010 --> 05:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to put me on medications that I
 
05:06:00.410 --> 05:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
knew would trigger my addiction this
 
05:06:03.350 --> 05:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
year I am celebrating 23 years of
 
05:06:08.030 --> 05:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
sobriety so I believe that this is a
 
05:06:11.930 --> 05:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
no-brainer and I welcome any questions
 
05:06:14.810 --> 05:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
that the committee may have for me and
 
05:06:16.490 --> 05:06:16.500 align:start position:0%

seeing no questions okay thank you very
 
05:06:24.298 --> 05:06:28.010 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions okay thank you very
much

05:06:28.010 --> 05:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:30.350 --> 05:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
and the final person signed up to speak
 
05:06:39.530 --> 05:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:41.690 --> 05:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
again three minutes sir
 
05:06:43.448 --> 05:06:43.458 align:start position:0%
thank you start the clock
 
05:06:46.368 --> 05:06:46.378 align:start position:0%
my name is Joe Hannan
 
05:06:47.990 --> 05:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
um former State Rep I'm a retired Foot
 
05:06:49.550 --> 05:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
and Ankle surgeon and I was a member of
 
05:06:51.050 --> 05:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire study commission for
 
05:06:52.670 --> 05:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
legalization and Taxation to cannabis
 
05:06:55.070 --> 05:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
back a few years ago
 
05:06:57.110 --> 05:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
um I'd just like to start off by saying
 
05:06:59.030 --> 05:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's actually cruel for
 
05:07:01.010 --> 05:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
the law to require serious side effects
 
05:07:03.530 --> 05:07:03.540 align:start position:0%
needless suffering or surgery before
 
05:07:05.990 --> 05:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
non-surgical options
 
05:07:08.510 --> 05:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
um for patients and the provider's
 
05:07:10.250 --> 05:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
freedoms are limited
 
05:07:11.930 --> 05:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
um so they're they're not they don't
 
05:07:13.250 --> 05:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
have the freedom to recommend or certify
 
05:07:15.590 --> 05:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
patients as they see fit
 
05:07:17.690 --> 05:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
uh I have over 31 years in recovery
 
05:07:19.430 --> 05:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
myself and over that time I've had
 
05:07:21.230 --> 05:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
several serious injuries to motorcycle
 
05:07:24.770 --> 05:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
accidents several procedures where I was
 
05:07:26.628 --> 05:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
almost forced to take pain medication
 
05:07:28.850 --> 05:07:28.860 align:start position:0%
and all but one time and that whole time
 
05:07:30.770 --> 05:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
I took one Percocet and I all those
 
05:07:32.270 --> 05:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
broken bones and surgeries I said no
 
05:07:33.590 --> 05:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
because I was afraid of having to take
 
05:07:37.010 --> 05:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
stronger uh pain medication I muscled
 
05:07:38.810 --> 05:07:38.820 align:start position:0%
through it don't recommend it was pretty
 
05:07:41.990 --> 05:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
stupid but uh back then the option for
 
05:07:45.050 --> 05:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
uh other other non-opiate options Warren
 
05:07:48.288 --> 05:07:48.298 align:start position:0%
is available Beyond just NSAIDs
 
05:07:49.970 --> 05:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
um I have many friends in the recovery
 
05:07:51.050 --> 05:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
community that I've worked with and
 
05:07:53.090 --> 05:07:53.100 align:start position:0%
spoken with and several have gone
 
05:07:55.550 --> 05:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
through uh you know cancer serious
 
05:07:57.050 --> 05:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
chronic pain
 
05:07:58.490 --> 05:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
and they've all told me they've had
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
difficulty getting cannabis legally in
 
05:08:02.090 --> 05:08:02.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for any kind of regular
 
05:08:03.890 --> 05:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
moderate pains especially and even
 
05:08:05.150 --> 05:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
severe pain
 
05:08:06.890 --> 05:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
and they didn't want to use opiates
 
05:08:08.930 --> 05:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
because of their substance use disorder
 
05:08:08.940 --> 05:08:09.948 align:start position:0%
because of their substance use disorder
histories

05:08:09.948 --> 05:08:09.958 align:start position:0%
histories
 
05:08:12.170 --> 05:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
it's actually extremely scary the one
 
05:08:14.330 --> 05:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
time I did take that little Valium and a
 
05:08:17.390 --> 05:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
Percocet for a surgery I was a mess I
 
05:08:19.550 --> 05:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
only took it for one time spent the
 
05:08:22.070 --> 05:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
whole day in bed and I was emotionally a
 
05:08:24.170 --> 05:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
wreck for weeks maybe a few months
 
05:08:26.270 --> 05:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
afterwards and that was
 
05:08:28.970 --> 05:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
18 years ago I don't want to have to go
 
05:08:30.170 --> 05:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
through that again I don't want anyone
 
05:08:32.390 --> 05:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
to have to go through that
 
05:08:32.400 --> 05:08:33.230 align:start position:0%
to have to go through that
um

05:08:33.230 --> 05:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:35.090 --> 05:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
like I said cannabis can be preferred
 
05:08:37.010 --> 05:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
over opiates especially for people that
 
05:08:39.708 --> 05:08:39.718 align:start position:0%
have a history of opiate use uh you
 
05:08:41.208 --> 05:08:41.218 align:start position:0%
can't really cut Percocets and some
 
05:08:43.190 --> 05:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
other opiates in into smaller doses if
 
05:08:44.570 --> 05:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
you think that's required it's much
 
05:08:48.110 --> 05:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
easier to to micro dose or cut a edible
 
05:08:50.330 --> 05:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
or something uh drops or any kind of
 
05:08:52.368 --> 05:08:52.378 align:start position:0%
cannabis into a smaller dose where you
 
05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
may not even have any psychoactive
 
05:08:55.490 --> 05:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
effects you may just have just enough to
 
05:08:57.288 --> 05:08:57.298 align:start position:0%
take the edge off and that's very
 
05:08:57.298 --> 05:08:58.430 align:start position:0%
take the edge off and that's very
important

05:08:58.430 --> 05:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:08:59.990 --> 05:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
um you shouldn't be cutting up anyone's
 
05:09:00.890 --> 05:09:00.900 align:start position:0%
listening you shouldn't be cutting up
 
05:09:04.128 --> 05:09:04.138 align:start position:0%
Percocets or any other opiates
 
05:09:05.628 --> 05:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
um and when I back when I was
 
05:09:07.190 --> 05:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
prescribing I would often give people a
 
05:09:08.628 --> 05:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
Percocet prescription after a foot and
 
05:09:11.090 --> 05:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
ankle surgery or a broken Serious injury
 
05:09:13.128 --> 05:09:13.138 align:start position:0%
and you know that back then it was
 
05:09:14.810 --> 05:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
things have changed we gave like 30 and
 
05:09:15.948 --> 05:09:15.958 align:start position:0%
here you go that's what you're getting I
 
05:09:18.530 --> 05:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
know we give less now but uh even when
 
05:09:19.850 --> 05:09:19.860 align:start position:0%
you give less if they only take one or
 
05:09:21.288 --> 05:09:21.298 align:start position:0%
two those extra pills are gonna sit in
 
05:09:23.150 --> 05:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
someone's medicine cabinet and that is
 
05:09:25.190 --> 05:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
more dangerous it's a more lethal option
 
05:09:26.810 --> 05:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
to leave around for other family friends
 
05:09:29.270 --> 05:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
and children than it is for cannabis
 
05:09:31.850 --> 05:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
so I beg you to please make this
 
05:09:34.310 --> 05:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
necessary change and I'd be happy to
 
05:09:35.690 --> 05:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
take any questions or just go back and
 
05:09:37.788 --> 05:09:37.798 align:start position:0%
sit so we can keep going okay thank you

05:10:32.690 --> 05:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate this opportunity to
 
05:10:35.270 --> 05:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
prevent present House Bill excuse me
 
05:10:37.070 --> 05:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
again for the record
 
05:10:39.288 --> 05:10:39.298 align:start position:0%
my name is Suzanne Vale and I'm a state
 
05:10:42.470 --> 05:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative from Nashua
 
05:10:44.030 --> 05:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for this opportunity to
 
05:10:46.850 --> 05:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
present House Bill 610 which expands the
 
05:10:48.708 --> 05:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
definition of provider in the state law
 
05:10:50.510 --> 05:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
in the section of title X Public Health
 
05:10:53.590 --> 05:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
chapter 126 section
 
05:10:59.030 --> 05:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
126-x11 excuse me X colon 1. I filed
 
05:11:00.708 --> 05:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
this bill at the request of The
 
05:11:02.510 --> 05:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
Honorable Jerry Canard chairman of the
 
05:11:04.670 --> 05:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
05:11:07.128 --> 05:11:07.138 align:start position:0%
board and so I'm going to defer to him
 
05:11:09.470 --> 05:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
to um to go through the bill with you
 
05:11:12.650 --> 05:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
and to explain what's going on
 
05:11:14.930 --> 05:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
um and what his thoughts were when he
 
05:11:17.990 --> 05:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
filed when he planned to file this
 
05:11:20.030 --> 05:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
I just also wanted to mention that I
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
think this is a powerful bill and I
 
05:11:23.150 --> 05:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
think it's really important as I get
 
05:11:25.250 --> 05:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
back to the stigma of being a
 
05:11:27.288 --> 05:11:27.298 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patient and being a
 
05:11:29.030 --> 05:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
person who has a chronic illness of any
 
05:11:31.250 --> 05:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
kind and that's that you want to see
 
05:11:32.570 --> 05:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
your own doctor
 
05:11:35.570 --> 05:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
you want to see your own doctor and you
 
05:11:37.368 --> 05:11:37.378 align:start position:0%
want to look at these labels and these
 
05:11:39.530 --> 05:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
terpenes and these cannabinoids and all
 
05:11:41.390 --> 05:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
of these elements to see how they can
 
05:11:44.030 --> 05:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
help and you would be able to work
 
05:11:46.010 --> 05:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
together with your doctor your own
 
05:11:48.890 --> 05:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
doctor without looking for someone who
 
05:11:51.288 --> 05:11:51.298 align:start position:0%
is certified to certify
 
05:11:56.390 --> 05:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:58.310 --> 05:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll conclude my testimony
 
05:12:00.830 --> 05:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
 
05:12:00.840 --> 05:12:03.708 align:start position:0%

cannabis program this is yet oh I'm

05:12:44.570 --> 05:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
removes obstacles to the Cannabis
 
05:12:47.510 --> 05:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
program if we can agree that patients
 
05:12:50.270 --> 05:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
with severe pain should not be required
 
05:12:52.430 --> 05:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
to go through a trial of opioid use
 
05:12:54.170 --> 05:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
prior to being qualified for the
 
05:12:56.030 --> 05:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program and if we
 
05:12:58.128 --> 05:12:58.138 align:start position:0%
can agree that we have an opioid
 
05:12:59.868 --> 05:12:59.878 align:start position:0%
epidemic in New Hampshire that must be
 
05:13:02.270 --> 05:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
addressed then we should also be able to
 
05:13:04.550 --> 05:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
agree that any physician who can
 
05:13:07.190 --> 05:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
prescribe medications to humans should
 
05:13:09.530 --> 05:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
be able to qualify someone for the
 
05:13:12.110 --> 05:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
non-narcotic therapeutic cannabis
 
05:13:12.120 --> 05:13:13.670 align:start position:0%
non-narcotic therapeutic cannabis
program

05:13:13.670 --> 05:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:13:15.530 --> 05:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
some patients have a difficult time
 
05:13:17.448 --> 05:13:17.458 align:start position:0%
finding a provider who is willing to
 
05:13:19.250 --> 05:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
qualify a patient for the therapeutic
 
05:13:21.770 --> 05:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
program and some patients prefer to use
 
05:13:24.410 --> 05:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
alternative therapies this bill would
 
05:13:26.330 --> 05:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
allow the patient to pursue alternative
 
05:13:28.490 --> 05:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
therapies and still be qualified for the
 
05:13:28.500 --> 05:13:29.390 align:start position:0%
therapies and still be qualified for the
program

05:13:29.390 --> 05:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:13:31.850 --> 05:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
this would allow say a naturopath who
 
05:13:34.250 --> 05:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
has a very good understanding of how to
 
05:13:36.590 --> 05:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
treat humans to be able to qualify the
 
05:13:38.330 --> 05:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
patient for the program
 
05:13:40.010 --> 05:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
as long as the state of New Hampshire
 
05:13:41.990 --> 05:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
trusts a physician to prescribe
 
05:13:44.570 --> 05:13:44.580 align:start position:0%
medications then they should trust that
 
05:13:46.430 --> 05:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
physician to be able to qualify someone
 
05:13:48.890 --> 05:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
for a legal medical and therapeutic
 
05:13:50.510 --> 05:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis program
 
05:13:53.150 --> 05:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
with regard to section two of the bill
 
05:13:55.550 --> 05:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
many pediatricians are reluctant to
 
05:13:58.550 --> 05:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
prescribe cannabis some children like my
 
05:14:00.470 --> 05:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
own kids transitioned from a
 
05:14:02.868 --> 05:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
pediatrician to a family provider while
 
05:14:04.128 --> 05:14:04.138 align:start position:0%
still young
 
05:14:06.288 --> 05:14:06.298 align:start position:0%
we felt that our family doctor had a
 
05:14:08.150 --> 05:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
better holistic view of their entire
 
05:14:08.160 --> 05:14:09.170 align:start position:0%
better holistic view of their entire
bodies

05:14:09.170 --> 05:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
05:14:11.448 --> 05:14:11.458 align:start position:0%
this bill would not require the parents
 
05:14:14.570 --> 05:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
who use a family provider to then find a
 
05:14:16.910 --> 05:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
separate pediatrician simply to fulfill
 
05:14:19.670 --> 05:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
a program requirement it allows more
 
05:14:21.530 --> 05:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
flexibility for parents and their
 
05:14:21.540 --> 05:14:22.610 align:start position:0%
flexibility for parents and their
children

05:14:22.610 --> 05:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:14:24.530 --> 05:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
I would urge everyone on the committee
 
05:14:26.690 --> 05:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
to support this bill that brings relief
 
05:14:28.670 --> 05:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
to many of our most vulnerable patients
 
05:14:32.930 --> 05:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
and voted OTP out of committee thank you
 
05:14:34.550 --> 05:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for representative
 
05:14:34.560 --> 05:14:37.670 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for representative
Thomas

05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:42.590 --> 05:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:45.288 --> 05:14:45.298 align:start position:0%
and also signed up to speak is former
 
05:15:04.448 --> 05:15:04.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:06.470 --> 05:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and again for the record Jerry
 
05:15:07.910 --> 05:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
can Eric chair of the therapy cannabis
 
05:15:10.010 --> 05:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board by the way in
 
05:15:11.270 --> 05:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
the testimony coming around you're going
 
05:15:12.708 --> 05:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
to notice a few things that I corrected
 
05:15:14.330 --> 05:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
I found some typos while I was sitting
 
05:15:16.490 --> 05:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
there so I corrected each of the 22
 
05:15:16.500 --> 05:15:17.868 align:start position:0%
there so I corrected each of the 22
copies

05:15:17.868 --> 05:15:17.878 align:start position:0%
copies
 
05:15:20.570 --> 05:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
um anyway bottom line is that HB 610 was
 
05:15:22.010 --> 05:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
filed that the request not really just
 
05:15:24.288 --> 05:15:24.298 align:start position:0%
of me but of the therapeutic cannabis
 
05:15:25.910 --> 05:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board which voted
 
05:15:28.250 --> 05:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
unanimously it is December 2022 meeting
 
05:15:29.868 --> 05:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
to support the bill that is currently
 
05:15:29.878 --> 05:15:30.830 align:start position:0%
to support the bill that is currently
written

05:15:30.830 --> 05:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
written
 
05:15:33.770 --> 05:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
the board wishes to expand the types of
 
05:15:35.930 --> 05:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
providers who can certify a patient to
 
05:15:38.090 --> 05:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
use therapeutic cannabis just a quick
 
05:15:40.430 --> 05:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
review again to enroll in therapeutic
 
05:15:41.990 --> 05:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis program patients must be
 
05:15:43.490 --> 05:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
certified by their medical providers
 
05:15:46.250 --> 05:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
having a qualifying medical condition
 
05:15:50.750 --> 05:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 126 X1 Roman numeral seven I had
 
05:15:52.368 --> 05:15:52.378 align:start position:0%
eight in it it's seven I'm sorry about
 
05:15:54.708 --> 05:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
that that defines which providers are
 
05:15:56.810 --> 05:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
able to certify patients to qualify for
 
05:15:58.850 --> 05:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis and the list has
 
05:16:00.770 --> 05:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
grown over the years most recently with
 
05:16:02.810 --> 05:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
the addition of physician assistance to
 
05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
that list
 
05:16:06.470 --> 05:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
tcmob wishes to expand the list to
 
05:16:08.330 --> 05:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
Providers to reflect the practice
 
05:16:10.490 --> 05:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
environment in New Hampshire especially
 
05:16:13.128 --> 05:16:13.138 align:start position:0%
in rural areas where many people have a
 
05:16:15.530 --> 05:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
provider other than a physician or even
 
05:16:19.610 --> 05:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
a primary uh even a APRN or a PA as
 
05:16:21.590 --> 05:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
their primary care provider and then to
 
05:16:22.910 --> 05:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
include other patients or other
 
05:16:24.650 --> 05:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
providers I'm sorry who may be treating
 
05:16:26.810 --> 05:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
a patient for example they may be
 
05:16:28.910 --> 05:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
treating with a naturopath and there's
 
05:16:30.410 --> 05:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
no reason they would have to go off to
 
05:16:32.868 --> 05:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
somebody else to get certified
 
05:16:35.208 --> 05:16:35.218 align:start position:0%
now if we look at it lines one to five
 
05:16:37.250 --> 05:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
that's the section that expands the list
 
05:16:38.930 --> 05:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
to include other providers who might
 
05:16:41.208 --> 05:16:41.218 align:start position:0%
consider certifying a patient when the
 
05:16:42.890 --> 05:16:42.900 align:start position:0%
board first discussed this we made a
 
05:16:44.448 --> 05:16:44.458 align:start position:0%
list of providers to consider for
 
05:16:47.090 --> 05:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
expansion including naturopaths dentists
 
05:16:49.070 --> 05:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
podiatrists and so on but we always know
 
05:16:51.050 --> 05:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
the evil of lists it's that issue of who
 
05:16:52.310 --> 05:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
has been excluded and who's been
 
05:16:54.288 --> 05:16:54.298 align:start position:0%
included and we ultimately thought it
 
05:16:55.430 --> 05:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
would be a lot easier and
 
05:16:56.930 --> 05:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
straightforward just to allow any
 
05:16:58.670 --> 05:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
provider who's licensed to prescribe
 
05:17:01.550 --> 05:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
drugs to humans and to possess an active
 
05:17:04.190 --> 05:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
registration from the US DEA to
 
05:17:06.050 --> 05:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
prescribe Controlled Substances to be
 
05:17:08.030 --> 05:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to certify a patient to be a
 
05:17:10.250 --> 05:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
qualifying patient we didn't make up
 
05:17:13.190 --> 05:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
that language that language mirrors the
 
05:17:15.230 --> 05:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
language that's used already in statute
 
05:17:17.050 --> 05:17:17.060 align:start position:0%
for each of the other provider groups
 
05:17:19.310 --> 05:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
that are currently allowed to certify
 
05:17:20.570 --> 05:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
patients they all have that same
 
05:17:23.208 --> 05:17:23.218 align:start position:0%
phraseology of License to prescribed
 
05:17:26.390 --> 05:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
humans and possess an active DEA license
 
05:17:28.310 --> 05:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
the second part of the bill
 
05:17:31.190 --> 05:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
line six to ten is also a revision to
 
05:17:32.810 --> 05:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
reflect the reality of Medical Practice
 
05:17:34.490 --> 05:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
05:17:36.530 --> 05:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
because of the unique risks of
 
05:17:38.208 --> 05:17:38.218 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis in children and
 
05:17:39.948 --> 05:17:39.958 align:start position:0%
that's particularly true in adolescence
 
05:17:43.730 --> 05:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
when the brain is developing uh THC can
 
05:17:45.530 --> 05:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
have a very distinctive problems so you
 
05:17:46.730 --> 05:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
have to really weigh the risks and
 
05:17:48.830 --> 05:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
benefits because of those unique risks
 
05:17:51.288 --> 05:17:51.298 align:start position:0%
guard rails currently exist in statute
 
05:17:52.850 --> 05:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
that a child being considered for
 
05:17:55.788 --> 05:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
certification needs to be certified by
 
05:17:58.490 --> 05:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
two providers current statutory language
 
05:18:00.170 --> 05:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
mandates that one of their providers
 
05:18:02.448 --> 05:18:02.458 align:start position:0%
must be a pediatrician
 
05:18:04.730 --> 05:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
but you know there's a lot not a whole
 
05:18:05.990 --> 05:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
lot of Pediatricians up in the north
 
05:18:08.270 --> 05:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
area where I'm from for example uh many
 
05:18:09.948 --> 05:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
areas there may not be any pediatrician
 
05:18:12.948 --> 05:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
a child may have as their PCP a family
 
05:18:16.010 --> 05:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
practice provider who provides Pediatric
 
05:18:16.020 --> 05:18:17.090 align:start position:0%
practice provider who provides Pediatric
Care

05:18:17.090 --> 05:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
Care
 
05:18:19.670 --> 05:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
so tcmbb felt it would be best for the
 
05:18:21.530 --> 05:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
child to have that second certification
 
05:18:24.650 --> 05:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
for example by their PCP even if they're
 
05:18:26.690 --> 05:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
a family practice provider who provides
 
05:18:29.030 --> 05:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
Pediatric Care rather than having to
 
05:18:31.190 --> 05:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
travel to see a pediatrician who's not
 
05:18:33.770 --> 05:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
their provider to be certified I also
 
05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
need to point out that we only have 11
 
05:18:38.628 --> 05:18:38.638 align:start position:0%
patients under age 18 certified so
 
05:18:39.830 --> 05:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
there's not a whole lot of patients
 
05:18:41.690 --> 05:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
anyway that would be affected by this
 
05:18:43.368 --> 05:18:43.378 align:start position:0%
but it would just make it easier for
 
05:18:45.410 --> 05:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
those of you who do need it but again we
 
05:18:47.750 --> 05:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
have strong guardrails about kids in
 
05:18:49.550 --> 05:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
that so please honor the request of
 
05:18:52.850 --> 05:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
tcmob and pass HB 610 in order to
 
05:18:54.770 --> 05:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
facilitate the certification of our
 
05:18:56.510 --> 05:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
qualifying patients I'd be glad to take
 
05:18:58.550 --> 05:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
any questions about that statutory
 
05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
structure or anything okay questions yes
 
05:19:03.650 --> 05:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
05:19:05.390 --> 05:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
05:19:05.400 --> 05:19:06.350 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
I'm

05:19:06.350 --> 05:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
05:19:08.330 --> 05:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
it may be explained for me better I'm
 
05:19:10.250 --> 05:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
trying to see who's not included and you
 
05:19:12.350 --> 05:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned naturopath specifically but I
 
05:19:13.910 --> 05:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
didn't think that they were licensed to
 
05:19:16.250 --> 05:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
be able to prescribe not all of them are
 
05:19:17.930 --> 05:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
but some of them can some of them have
 
05:19:19.730 --> 05:19:19.740 align:start position:0%
can prescribe drugs that's actually what
 
05:19:21.890 --> 05:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
we were going through trying to come up
 
05:19:23.990 --> 05:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
with a laundry list and uh you know we
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
were going to contact oplc and try to
 
05:19:28.010 --> 05:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
sort out who can and can't and so on and
 
05:19:29.868 --> 05:19:29.878 align:start position:0%
that's where we find decided just to set
 
05:19:31.610 --> 05:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
the simple guard rail if you can
 
05:19:33.170 --> 05:19:33.180 align:start position:0%
prescribe to humans
 
05:19:34.970 --> 05:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
that's so that we don't have the vets
 
05:19:37.970 --> 05:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
and if you have a DEA license then
 
05:19:40.128 --> 05:19:40.138 align:start position:0%
you're certified to qualify because why
 
05:19:41.510 --> 05:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
should it matter if you're a naturopath
 
05:19:44.750 --> 05:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
or a PA or an APRN or a physician or a
 
05:19:46.490 --> 05:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
do so you're functioning just adding
 
05:19:47.990 --> 05:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
natural paths
 
05:19:50.208 --> 05:19:50.218 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean although in dentists as well
 
05:19:51.530 --> 05:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
because I think dentists are currently
 
05:19:53.628 --> 05:19:53.638 align:start position:0%
not included and you may be seeing a
 
05:19:56.150 --> 05:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
dentist for a chronic tooth problem
 
05:19:58.430 --> 05:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
chronic pain and they may have done
 
05:19:59.690 --> 05:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
everything they can to try to help it
 
05:20:01.190 --> 05:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
and it's not working and this would give
 
05:20:02.690 --> 05:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
them a choice
 
05:20:07.550 --> 05:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:09.410 --> 05:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thank you for taking the
 
05:20:09.420 --> 05:20:10.250 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thank you for taking the
question

05:20:10.250 --> 05:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:20:13.310 --> 05:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Dr Jerry Canuck it's good
 
05:20:15.590 --> 05:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
to see you back Jerry thanks would you
 
05:20:18.470 --> 05:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
be opposed to or it says at the end on
 
05:20:20.930 --> 05:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
line nine
 
05:20:24.890 --> 05:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:26.810 --> 05:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
a licensed provider
 
05:20:29.330 --> 05:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
of which one is
 
05:20:31.970 --> 05:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
qualified to provide pediatric or Adult
 
05:20:34.550 --> 05:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
Family Care what I'm trying to get to is
 
05:20:36.470 --> 05:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
that we have Pas we have nurse
 
05:20:38.628 --> 05:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
practitioners we have naturopaths why
 
05:20:41.330 --> 05:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
limited to a physician or limited to
 
05:20:43.670 --> 05:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
that category when above it for humans
 
05:20:45.230 --> 05:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
they can actually write for almost all
 
05:20:47.390 --> 05:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
of the human subjects but below it we're
 
05:20:49.128 --> 05:20:49.138 align:start position:0%
restricting it to a pediatrician or
 
05:20:50.510 --> 05:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
Family Practice why not have somebody
 
05:20:52.010 --> 05:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
that's a PA or nurse practitioner as
 
05:20:53.750 --> 05:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
well but we did say Family Practice
 
05:20:56.270 --> 05:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
provider and indeed that does not that
 
05:20:57.708 --> 05:20:57.718 align:start position:0%
we didn't choose the word physician
 
05:21:00.590 --> 05:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
Family Practice provider could be a PA
 
05:21:02.650 --> 05:21:02.660 align:start position:0%
or an APRN who does kids
 
05:21:05.090 --> 05:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
correct but a pediatrician would be
 
05:21:06.590 --> 05:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
normally a physician so I want to
 
05:21:08.390 --> 05:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
clarify that it could be a nurse
 
05:21:10.430 --> 05:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
practitioner who'd actually specializes
 
05:21:12.288 --> 05:21:12.298 align:start position:0%
in Pediatrics
 
05:21:14.628 --> 05:21:14.638 align:start position:0%
or could be but that's why you're saying
 
05:21:16.550 --> 05:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
a family practice provider provides
 
05:21:19.070 --> 05:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
pediatric care I mean if you're
 
05:21:20.930 --> 05:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
you're I think that's clear you're
 
05:21:22.670 --> 05:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
saying just say somebody who treats
 
05:21:22.680 --> 05:21:23.650 align:start position:0%
saying just say somebody who treats
children

05:21:23.650 --> 05:21:23.660 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:21:23.660 --> 05:21:25.610 align:start position:0%
children
just

05:21:25.610 --> 05:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:21:27.288 --> 05:21:27.298 align:start position:0%
I misread it
 
05:21:28.970 --> 05:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for somebody's providing
 
05:21:31.010 --> 05:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
pediatric pediatrician
 
05:21:34.910 --> 05:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
is really kind of a physician yes so a
 
05:21:36.470 --> 05:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner who's doing Pediatric
 
05:21:36.480 --> 05:21:37.550 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner who's doing Pediatric
Care

05:21:37.550 --> 05:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
Care
 
05:21:42.010 --> 05:21:42.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:45.590 --> 05:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
providing Pediatric Care is not family
 
05:21:47.090 --> 05:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
I see what you're saying because that
 
05:21:49.730 --> 05:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
that that could be an APRN who doesn't
 
05:21:53.448 --> 05:21:53.458 align:start position:0%
do Family Practice only does kids
 
05:21:55.368 --> 05:21:55.378 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite this this may be a
 
05:21:57.070 --> 05:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
question for oplc as to what kind of
 
05:21:59.570 --> 05:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
classifications we have there and or
 
05:22:01.788 --> 05:22:01.798 align:start position:0%
maybe for nursing to know how that is
 
05:22:04.490 --> 05:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
shakes out because I don't know if
 
05:22:05.448 --> 05:22:05.458 align:start position:0%
they're still viewed as a family
 
05:22:07.310 --> 05:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
practice provider and all the practices
 
05:22:11.090 --> 05:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
I've been working with aprns do adults
 
05:22:13.128 --> 05:22:13.138 align:start position:0%
and kids but I suppose in a very large
 
05:22:14.990 --> 05:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
area there could be one who doesn't do
 
05:22:16.368 --> 05:22:16.378 align:start position:0%
any adults
 
05:22:18.530 --> 05:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to remove as many
 
05:22:20.208 --> 05:22:20.218 align:start position:0%
barriers as possible sure
 
05:22:22.910 --> 05:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
maybe one could just strike it I don't
 
05:22:24.350 --> 05:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
think TCM would be able to object to
 
05:22:26.868 --> 05:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
saying or a provider who provides
 
05:22:29.030 --> 05:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
pediatric care and get rid of family
 
05:22:31.310 --> 05:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
practice just in case there may be a
 
05:22:35.230 --> 05:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
small number of Pas or aprns who are
 
05:22:37.670 --> 05:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
providing pediatric care but are not
 
05:22:39.670 --> 05:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
officially a family practice person
 
05:22:42.708 --> 05:22:42.718 align:start position:0%
correct I think possible Michael Holt
 
05:22:44.690 --> 05:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
who's here might know a little bit more
 
05:22:46.310 --> 05:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
about some of that licensure issue
 
05:22:48.170 --> 05:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
because he's from the department and
 
05:22:50.090 --> 05:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
might be able to clarify that
 
05:22:50.100 --> 05:22:51.830 align:start position:0%
might be able to clarify that
thanks

05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
05:22:54.250 --> 05:22:54.260 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:22:57.050 --> 05:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
if I could clarify just put pediatric
 
05:23:01.970 --> 05:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:05.690 --> 05:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
uh may I yes oh the problem is saying
 
05:23:07.550 --> 05:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
pediatric provider or Family Practice
 
05:23:09.470 --> 05:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
provider with the initial language was
 
05:23:12.110 --> 05:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
or a family practice provider period we
 
05:23:13.730 --> 05:23:13.740 align:start position:0%
did want it clarified that it was a
 
05:23:15.470 --> 05:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
family practice provider who does take
 
05:23:18.050 --> 05:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
care of kids so it we shouldn't use the
 
05:23:19.610 --> 05:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
oreconstruct there because then that
 
05:23:21.530 --> 05:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
would put us back to what we had with
 
05:23:23.090 --> 05:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
TCM would be it sort of objected to
 
05:23:25.788 --> 05:23:25.798 align:start position:0%
someone could just say or a provider who
 
05:23:27.650 --> 05:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
provides pediatric care and that would
 
05:23:29.690 --> 05:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
certainly solve that problem and I think
 
05:23:32.030 --> 05:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
we would have no objection to that
 
05:23:34.550 --> 05:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
um because our concern was to make sure
 
05:23:35.930 --> 05:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
that it's not a family practice and
 
05:23:37.550 --> 05:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
provider who has never looked at a kid
 
05:23:39.350 --> 05:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
because there are unique problems in
 
05:23:41.690 --> 05:23:41.700 align:start position:0%
kids and you need to know those unique
 
05:23:41.700 --> 05:23:43.550 align:start position:0%
kids and you need to know those unique
problems

05:23:43.550 --> 05:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
problems
 
05:23:46.190 --> 05:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
05:23:49.128 --> 05:23:49.138 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:23:52.730 --> 05:23:52.740 align:start position:0%
you Dr former rep for taking my question
 
05:23:55.250 --> 05:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a problem at all with
 
05:23:56.270 --> 05:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:23:57.890 --> 05:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
pediatrician or Family Practice Center
 
05:23:59.448 --> 05:23:59.458 align:start position:0%
because a lot of family practitioners
 
05:24:01.368 --> 05:24:01.378 align:start position:0%
take care of kids anyway so to me that
 
05:24:03.410 --> 05:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
makes sense what I'm I'm struggling with
 
05:24:04.610 --> 05:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
I mean probably because I don't know
 
05:24:07.010 --> 05:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
when when I had a DEA number
 
05:24:09.050 --> 05:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
as you know every two years or whatever
 
05:24:10.730 --> 05:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
it was we had to check off the boxes
 
05:24:13.730 --> 05:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
that we would provide scripts for you
 
05:24:15.590 --> 05:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
know two three or four something like
 
05:24:17.690 --> 05:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
that never did I check off box number
 
05:24:17.700 --> 05:24:19.010 align:start position:0%
that never did I check off box number
one

05:24:19.010 --> 05:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:24:21.948 --> 05:24:21.958 align:start position:0%
um which is LSD in heroin right you know
 
05:24:21.958 --> 05:24:23.030 align:start position:0%
um which is LSD in heroin right you know
so

05:24:23.030 --> 05:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:24:26.090 --> 05:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
but my question is you when you open up
 
05:24:30.050 --> 05:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
this language to be so broad to say that
 
05:24:32.868 --> 05:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
um anybody that has a DEA number or
 
05:24:35.390 --> 05:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
license can now you know certify
 
05:24:37.128 --> 05:24:37.138 align:start position:0%
somebody into the therapeutic cannabis
 
05:24:39.230 --> 05:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
program which technically you know is
 
05:24:41.990 --> 05:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
still a schedule one drug even though
 
05:24:43.850 --> 05:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
it's it's allowed into medical cannabis
 
05:24:46.730 --> 05:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
my question is do all these providers
 
05:24:49.730 --> 05:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:53.448 --> 05:24:53.458 align:start position:0%
um naturopaths Dennis podiatrist do they
 
05:24:56.390 --> 05:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
all check off the same boxes as you did
 
05:24:59.208 --> 05:24:59.218 align:start position:0%
as a treating spine surgeon and if so
 
05:25:02.150 --> 05:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
how we're going to differentiate their
 
05:25:04.490 --> 05:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
abilities as well as you know not only
 
05:25:08.270 --> 05:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
just prescribing or certifying but also
 
05:25:10.670 --> 05:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
um in evaluating those who are most you
 
05:25:13.190 --> 05:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
know best served by this program well
 
05:25:15.590 --> 05:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
the issue is if they are not qualified
 
05:25:18.470 --> 05:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
to prescribe Controlled Substances then
 
05:25:19.670 --> 05:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed
 
05:25:21.948 --> 05:25:21.958 align:start position:0%
so the the the point is it'd be only
 
05:25:23.690 --> 05:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
those who have a DEA that allows them to
 
05:25:25.128 --> 05:25:25.138 align:start position:0%
prescribe control of substances and
 
05:25:26.510 --> 05:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
again important to understand that
 
05:25:29.510 --> 05:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
precise language exists in uh Roman
 
05:25:32.390 --> 05:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
numerals seven a numbers one two three
 
05:25:35.510 --> 05:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
four uh already because that's that's
 
05:25:37.010 --> 05:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
how we have it written in so we're not
 
05:25:38.628 --> 05:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
that's why I say we did not invent the
 
05:25:40.070 --> 05:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
statutory I think it would be simply
 
05:25:41.990 --> 05:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
mirrored what was already there but the
 
05:25:43.490 --> 05:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
issue is let's say a naturopath does not
 
05:25:45.770 --> 05:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
have a DEA they can't do it if they did
 
05:25:47.448 --> 05:25:47.458 align:start position:0%
not if they cannot do Controlled
 
05:25:49.910 --> 05:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
Substances they can't do it but if they
 
05:25:52.730 --> 05:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
are a license to prescribe to humans and
 
05:25:54.890 --> 05:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
they have a DEA to allow them to do
 
05:25:56.930 --> 05:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
Controlled Substances they would then be
 
05:25:58.670 --> 05:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to certify for therapeutic
 
05:25:58.680 --> 05:25:59.990 align:start position:0%
allowed to certify for therapeutic
cannabis

05:25:59.990 --> 05:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
05:26:02.990 --> 05:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
05:26:04.970 --> 05:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if we aren't making this
 
05:26:07.970 --> 05:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
much more complicated than it needs to
 
05:26:07.980 --> 05:26:09.050 align:start position:0%
much more complicated than it needs to
be

05:26:09.050 --> 05:26:09.060 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:26:11.510 --> 05:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
because what the statute currently
 
05:26:11.520 --> 05:26:12.650 align:start position:0%
because what the statute currently
allows

05:26:12.650 --> 05:26:12.660 align:start position:0%
allows
 
05:26:15.530 --> 05:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
is two providers
 
05:26:18.230 --> 05:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
one of whom may never have seen or
 
05:26:20.628 --> 05:26:20.638 align:start position:0%
treated a child ever before but has a
 
05:26:22.250 --> 05:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
DEA license
 
05:26:26.330 --> 05:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
already and the other one it looks like
 
05:26:28.610 --> 05:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
all we're trying to do is make sure that
 
05:26:31.510 --> 05:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
at least one of the two
 
05:26:35.330 --> 05:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
has had some experience working with
 
05:26:35.340 --> 05:26:36.350 align:start position:0%
has had some experience working with
children

05:26:36.350 --> 05:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:26:40.368 --> 05:26:40.378 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm wondering why we need to make
 
05:26:43.610 --> 05:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
it more complicated than that if we've
 
05:26:48.288 --> 05:26:48.298 align:start position:0%
already been comfortable with
 
05:26:50.690 --> 05:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
virtually the same sort of thing all the
 
05:26:52.070 --> 05:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
way along I mean one of these people
 
05:26:55.128 --> 05:26:55.138 align:start position:0%
never has to have seen a kid
 
05:26:58.310 --> 05:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
may I yeah yes I mean that exactly but
 
05:26:59.448 --> 05:26:59.458 align:start position:0%
that's that's what's currently in
 
05:27:00.948 --> 05:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
statute is that we have to have a
 
05:27:02.930 --> 05:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
pediatrician but the issue is a lot of
 
05:27:04.670 --> 05:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
kids don't have access to a pediatrician
 
05:27:07.010 --> 05:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to Simply expand it so that
 
05:27:08.810 --> 05:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
it would be somebody else as that
 
05:27:10.730 --> 05:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
secondary provider who does deal with
 
05:27:10.740 --> 05:27:11.750 align:start position:0%
secondary provider who does deal with
children

05:27:11.750 --> 05:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:27:11.760 --> 05:27:12.890 align:start position:0%
children
but

05:27:12.890 --> 05:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:27:15.350 --> 05:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
it may have followed
 
05:27:18.650 --> 05:27:18.660 align:start position:0%
my point exactly I'm wondering if we're
 
05:27:21.230 --> 05:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
not as we're trying to redraft it in
 
05:27:22.610 --> 05:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
many ways
 
05:27:24.770 --> 05:27:24.780 align:start position:0%
making something that's relatively
 
05:27:27.490 --> 05:27:27.500 align:start position:0%
simple which is just expanding it Beyond
 
05:27:29.570 --> 05:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
pediatricians to other people who have
 
05:27:31.550 --> 05:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
treated children
 
05:27:31.560 --> 05:27:32.150 align:start position:0%
treated children
um

05:27:32.150 --> 05:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:34.490 --> 05:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
do do
 
05:27:37.610 --> 05:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying trying to get around the
 
05:27:40.010 --> 05:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
if we redraft it six different ways are
 
05:27:41.750 --> 05:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
we making it more complicated in this
 
05:27:43.910 --> 05:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
case and I know I try and redraft other
 
05:27:45.770 --> 05:27:45.780 align:start position:0%
things but here I was
 
05:27:49.368 --> 05:27:49.378 align:start position:0%
it's such a very clear objective
 
05:27:51.708 --> 05:27:51.718 align:start position:0%
well I mean one could for example just
 
05:27:53.628 --> 05:27:53.638 align:start position:0%
change the whole thing instead of saying
 
05:27:56.208 --> 05:27:56.218 align:start position:0%
either a pediatrician or if a provider
 
05:27:57.470 --> 05:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
who provides pediatric care you could
 
05:27:58.490 --> 05:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
just say
 
05:28:00.410 --> 05:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
shall be a provider who provides
 
05:28:02.270 --> 05:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
Pediatric Care One could certainly do
 
05:28:04.368 --> 05:28:04.378 align:start position:0%
that and that would cover them both that
 
05:28:06.110 --> 05:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
would be a little more economy of words
 
05:28:08.448 --> 05:28:08.458 align:start position:0%
and I think that would be something we
 
05:28:10.788 --> 05:28:10.798 align:start position:0%
would still be very comfortable with we
 
05:28:13.670 --> 05:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
were I think we were being conservative
 
05:28:16.310 --> 05:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
and not wanting to strike language and
 
05:28:19.070 --> 05:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
trying to just add language but
 
05:28:21.110 --> 05:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes that is a little bit more
 
05:28:23.868 --> 05:28:23.878 align:start position:0%
cumbersome but I think it would
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
certainly not violate what the tcmob
 
05:28:28.788 --> 05:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
feels because it would still honor the
 
05:28:30.470 --> 05:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
desire that it's somebody who looks
 
05:28:32.208 --> 05:28:32.218 align:start position:0%
after kids whether it be a pediatrician
 
05:28:35.090 --> 05:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
or a and that's why you're getting away
 
05:28:36.650 --> 05:28:36.660 align:start position:0%
from the word Family Practice provider
 
05:28:39.770 --> 05:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
just in case it's an APRN who does uh
 
05:28:42.288 --> 05:28:42.298 align:start position:0%
kids only and otherwise doesn't take
 
05:28:44.868 --> 05:28:44.878 align:start position:0%
care of elderly like us
 
05:28:46.670 --> 05:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
um that would be pretty reasonable so
 
05:28:48.770 --> 05:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
that that could make it simpler and I
 
05:28:50.628 --> 05:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
think that would not violate our
 
05:28:50.638 --> 05:28:52.310 align:start position:0%
think that would not violate our
concerns

05:28:52.310 --> 05:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
05:28:53.628 --> 05:28:53.638 align:start position:0%
I think we were just more concerned
 
05:28:55.368 --> 05:28:55.378 align:start position:0%
about striking language that you know we
 
05:28:57.530 --> 05:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
didn't think that might be good so but
 
05:28:59.448 --> 05:28:59.458 align:start position:0%
you know how statutes get cumbersome as
 
05:29:00.410 --> 05:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
we keep adding just like those
 
05:29:02.270 --> 05:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
Standalone conditions we keep adding
 
05:29:03.350 --> 05:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
stuff and then it gets more and more
 
05:29:05.208 --> 05:29:05.218 align:start position:0%
cumbersome sometimes
 
05:29:08.750 --> 05:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:11.270 --> 05:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other questions okay thank
 
05:29:16.850 --> 05:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:19.010 --> 05:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak today on this
 
05:29:20.750 --> 05:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
bill is Michael Holt from the Department
 
05:29:29.050 --> 05:29:29.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:30.948 --> 05:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:29:31.970 --> 05:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
05:29:33.590 --> 05:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
Michael Holt I'm the administrator of
 
05:29:35.750 --> 05:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program within
 
05:29:36.830 --> 05:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
05:29:38.330 --> 05:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
Services Division of Public Health
 
05:29:40.910 --> 05:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
Services my testimony will be brief it's
 
05:29:43.310 --> 05:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
mostly to Avail myself the committee to
 
05:29:45.288 --> 05:29:45.298 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
05:29:47.090 --> 05:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
um this is a this is a straightforward
 
05:29:49.390 --> 05:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
uh bill that removes barrier to access
 
05:29:52.250 --> 05:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
it allows more providers to certify
 
05:29:55.250 --> 05:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
patients for the program I can confirm
 
05:29:57.890 --> 05:29:57.900 align:start position:0%
what Dr knurk said that is we have you
 
05:30:00.830 --> 05:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
know 10 or so uh minor patients on the
 
05:30:02.948 --> 05:30:02.958 align:start position:0%
program it's very limited
 
05:30:05.930 --> 05:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
population the and I would like to
 
05:30:08.208 --> 05:30:08.218 align:start position:0%
confirm that this is a call that we get
 
05:30:11.270 --> 05:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis from concerned
 
05:30:13.490 --> 05:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
parents who are struggling to get their
 
05:30:15.770 --> 05:30:15.780 align:start position:0%
kids onto the program you know we're not
 
05:30:17.810 --> 05:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
talking about a large population and and
 
05:30:20.090 --> 05:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
the number 10 reflects the the guard
 
05:30:22.970 --> 05:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
rails but it also reflects you know the
 
05:30:25.128 --> 05:30:25.138 align:start position:0%
concern that parents have about
 
05:30:27.410 --> 05:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
um about children using cannabis and THC
 
05:30:30.470 --> 05:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
products however
 
05:30:32.750 --> 05:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
kids don't see pediatricians
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
pediatricians are are difficult and this
 
05:30:38.030 --> 05:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
would expand it the two suggestions made
 
05:30:41.090 --> 05:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
in terms of expanding it even further
 
05:30:43.490 --> 05:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
um you know are consistent with the
 
05:30:45.230 --> 05:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
goals of this bill
 
05:30:47.390 --> 05:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
um uh representative former
 
05:30:49.368 --> 05:30:49.378 align:start position:0%
representative you know rightly says
 
05:30:51.410 --> 05:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
that uh the approach taken by the tcmob
 
05:30:53.030 --> 05:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
was a conservative one
 
05:30:55.250 --> 05:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
um to not strike pediatrician
 
05:30:56.628 --> 05:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
um the department is comfortable with
 
05:30:58.368 --> 05:30:58.378 align:start position:0%
this language has no objections nor
 
05:30:59.930 --> 05:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
would we have objections to further
 
05:31:02.448 --> 05:31:02.458 align:start position:0%
expanding this um to a more generic
 
05:31:05.990 --> 05:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
provider who provides Pediatric Care
 
05:31:06.000 --> 05:31:06.830 align:start position:0%
provider who provides Pediatric Care
um

05:31:06.830 --> 05:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:08.990 --> 05:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions I would
 
05:31:11.330 --> 05:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
like to make an aside to representative
 
05:31:13.010 --> 05:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
Nagel's question about how long it takes
 
05:31:15.830 --> 05:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
to get um a card from us
 
05:31:18.170 --> 05:31:18.180 align:start position:0%
um we have a statutory mandate to
 
05:31:20.448 --> 05:31:20.458 align:start position:0%
approve or deny an application within 15
 
05:31:22.730 --> 05:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
days and then after approval to get a
 
05:31:24.770 --> 05:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
card out within five we are well within
 
05:31:26.570 --> 05:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
our mandates we didn't used to be when
 
05:31:28.550 --> 05:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
the program first started based on you
 
05:31:30.590 --> 05:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
know Staffing and resources as a self a
 
05:31:32.810 --> 05:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
completely self-funded non-general fund
 
05:31:35.030 --> 05:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
program but I'm happy to report that for
 
05:31:36.830 --> 05:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
years we have been well within our
 
05:31:39.410 --> 05:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
statutes depending on volume and current
 
05:31:41.208 --> 05:31:41.218 align:start position:0%
Staffing levels you know we can get
 
05:31:43.310 --> 05:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
cards out within a week
 
05:31:45.530 --> 05:31:45.540 align:start position:0%
um but certainly we're consist uh
 
05:31:47.330 --> 05:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
compliant with the 15-day statute
 
05:31:47.340 --> 05:31:49.970 align:start position:0%
compliant with the 15-day statute
questions

05:31:49.970 --> 05:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:31:53.030 --> 05:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative Murphy uh
 
05:31:54.350 --> 05:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:31:56.330 --> 05:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question and again I probably
 
05:31:58.670 --> 05:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
didn't say it as eloquently to Dr kanerk
 
05:32:00.590 --> 05:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
as I should have but I'm trying to
 
05:32:01.970 --> 05:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
understand and I have no problem with
 
05:32:03.890 --> 05:32:03.900 align:start position:0%
the family practitioner and expanding it
 
05:32:06.170 --> 05:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
to these folks I I guess when I look at
 
05:32:08.030 --> 05:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
this bill and it says
 
05:32:10.670 --> 05:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh any provider that has a DEA number
 
05:32:14.090 --> 05:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
can now certify a patient to be in the
 
05:32:16.448 --> 05:32:16.458 align:start position:0%
program is that correct
 
05:32:19.570 --> 05:32:19.580 align:start position:0%
currently the law allows for Physicians
 
05:32:24.470 --> 05:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
Pas and aprns so and the requirement for
 
05:32:26.750 --> 05:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
each of those provider types is for them
 
05:32:29.448 --> 05:32:29.458 align:start position:0%
they must be authorized licensed as one
 
05:32:31.430 --> 05:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
of those provider types they must be
 
05:32:32.990 --> 05:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
licensed to prescribe drug to humans
 
05:32:35.510 --> 05:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
which excludes veterinarians and they
 
05:32:37.610 --> 05:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
must have an active registration for DEA
 
05:32:40.490 --> 05:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
support okay go ahead sorry it's
 
05:32:42.050 --> 05:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
important to know that therapeutic
 
05:32:43.788 --> 05:32:43.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis is not prescribed in the state
 
05:32:45.350 --> 05:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire it is it is a
 
05:32:46.910 --> 05:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
certification of a qualifying medical
 
05:32:50.090 --> 05:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
condition and so the DEA is a the
 
05:32:52.430 --> 05:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
requirement for a DEA number is intended
 
05:32:54.890 --> 05:32:54.900 align:start position:0%
to mean if you can prescribe you know
 
05:32:57.470 --> 05:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
Controlled Substances then you can uh
 
05:33:00.050 --> 05:33:00.060 align:start position:0%
certify for this program
 
05:33:00.060 --> 05:33:01.490 align:start position:0%
certify for this program
um

05:33:01.490 --> 05:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:04.850 --> 05:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
uh it is not a requirement for a
 
05:33:07.670 --> 05:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
reporting of a prescription based on
 
05:33:09.590 --> 05:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
your DEA number so there's no
 
05:33:11.390 --> 05:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
requirement for these providers to
 
05:33:13.070 --> 05:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
engage in the federal government and the
 
05:33:15.470 --> 05:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
DEA registration system you know to be a
 
05:33:18.948 --> 05:33:18.958 align:start position:0%
to certify for the the program thank you
 
05:33:21.230 --> 05:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
and I understand the DEA number and the
 
05:33:23.030 --> 05:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
different categories you listed I guess
 
05:33:25.788 --> 05:33:25.798 align:start position:0%
my question is more clearly what other
 
05:33:27.708 --> 05:33:27.718 align:start position:0%
qualifications do you have to have I
 
05:33:29.990 --> 05:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
mean what I'm thinking myself as an
 
05:33:31.670 --> 05:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
orthopedist I would never feel qualified
 
05:33:33.230 --> 05:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
to certify somebody for that program
 
05:33:34.730 --> 05:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
because I don't know enough about it so
 
05:33:36.770 --> 05:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand what the
 
05:33:38.868 --> 05:33:38.878 align:start position:0%
other qualifications of somebody that
 
05:33:40.368 --> 05:33:40.378 align:start position:0%
certifies r
 
05:33:44.690 --> 05:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:46.610 --> 05:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
there are no the state of New Hampshire
 
05:33:49.730 --> 05:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
does not require a certification of
 
05:33:52.610 --> 05:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
medical providers in the state
 
05:33:55.550 --> 05:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
um other states do require a in order to
 
05:33:58.610 --> 05:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
be a An approved provider to certify
 
05:34:00.350 --> 05:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
patients they need to be registered with
 
05:34:02.208 --> 05:34:02.218 align:start position:0%
the state as a cannabis provider New
 
05:34:04.190 --> 05:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law does not require that does
 
05:34:06.250 --> 05:34:06.260 align:start position:0%
not require training it does not require
 
05:34:08.750 --> 05:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
registration with the state as a as a
 
05:34:10.128 --> 05:34:10.138 align:start position:0%
cannabis provider
 
05:34:12.708 --> 05:34:12.718 align:start position:0%
um Etc so there are there are no other
 
05:34:15.470 --> 05:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
requirements for certification other
 
05:34:15.480 --> 05:34:16.550 align:start position:0%
requirements for certification other
than

05:34:16.550 --> 05:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:34:19.310 --> 05:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
having a provider-patient relationship
 
05:34:22.368 --> 05:34:22.378 align:start position:0%
with the patient explaining the health
 
05:34:25.970 --> 05:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
effects of cannabis to the patient
 
05:34:25.980 --> 05:34:26.510 align:start position:0%
effects of cannabis to the patient
um

05:34:26.510 --> 05:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:28.788 --> 05:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
explaining health effects and risks to
 
05:34:31.310 --> 05:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
certain Target populations those uh
 
05:34:33.890 --> 05:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
those who are pregnant breastfeeding and
 
05:34:36.110 --> 05:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
those who are adolescents the
 
05:34:38.150 --> 05:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
legislative the general court passed the
 
05:34:40.010 --> 05:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
law two years ago to require special
 
05:34:43.250 --> 05:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
education to those two populations But
 
05:34:44.270 --> 05:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
to answer your question there are no
 
05:34:46.490 --> 05:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
other requirements in order for a
 
05:34:49.250 --> 05:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
provider to certify their patients for
 
05:34:50.990 --> 05:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire therapeutic cannabis
 
05:34:51.000 --> 05:34:52.850 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire therapeutic cannabis
program

05:34:52.850 --> 05:34:52.860 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:34:52.860 --> 05:34:54.288 align:start position:0%
program
so

05:34:54.288 --> 05:34:54.298 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:56.090 --> 05:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
when I was practicing this follow-up
 
05:34:57.650 --> 05:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sorry when I was
 
05:34:59.208 --> 05:34:59.218 align:start position:0%
practicing then you're saying that I had
 
05:35:00.948 --> 05:35:00.958 align:start position:0%
a DA number and I had a license that was
 
05:35:02.448 --> 05:35:02.458 align:start position:0%
active in the state of New Hampshire and
 
05:35:03.650 --> 05:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
therefore I could have certified a
 
05:35:05.810 --> 05:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
patient into the program as a physician
 
05:35:10.250 --> 05:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
yes yes okay thank you representative
 
05:35:12.590 --> 05:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:35:15.770 --> 05:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh would you be able
 
05:35:20.390 --> 05:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
to tell uh about minus out of those 10
 
05:35:22.910 --> 05:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
or 11 miners who are currently in the
 
05:35:26.650 --> 05:35:26.660 align:start position:0%
program uh what kind of uh medical
 
05:35:30.490 --> 05:35:30.500 align:start position:0%
issues that line to solve with it and
 
05:35:34.250 --> 05:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
those who were not able to get there you
 
05:35:37.670 --> 05:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
said you receiving calls from parents as
 
05:35:40.490 --> 05:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
those medical issues the same or as a
 
05:35:43.190 --> 05:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
something as a set of medical issues
 
05:35:46.730 --> 05:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
that they want to solve this program but
 
05:35:51.830 --> 05:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:55.010 --> 05:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
so thank I do not have the list of uh
 
05:35:57.170 --> 05:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
minor patients on the program nor do I
 
05:35:58.670 --> 05:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
have in front of me the the qualifying
 
05:36:00.948 --> 05:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
conditions that they qualify for uh
 
05:36:03.770 --> 05:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
based on memory uh the the of the ten
 
05:36:06.770 --> 05:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
they are pain issues which is a you know
 
05:36:09.410 --> 05:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
which is as Dr canarka said you know 70
 
05:36:10.850 --> 05:36:10.860 align:start position:0%
plus percent of our patients are
 
05:36:12.590 --> 05:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
certified for a pain issue
 
05:36:15.110 --> 05:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
um the others are epilepsy
 
05:36:17.090 --> 05:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
um uh childhood epilepsy uh is is
 
05:36:19.190 --> 05:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
another uh
 
05:36:21.770 --> 05:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
there's another condition that is it's
 
05:36:23.628 --> 05:36:23.638 align:start position:0%
hard to say common there's only 10 you
 
05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
know so maybe two of them have epilepsy
 
05:36:27.890 --> 05:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
and six of them have pain and others
 
05:36:30.530 --> 05:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
have an undisclosed condition you know
 
05:36:33.708 --> 05:36:33.718 align:start position:0%
with uh with with a pain condition
 
05:36:36.050 --> 05:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
um there's there's no
 
05:36:38.208 --> 05:36:38.218 align:start position:0%
the list of qualifying conditions that
 
05:36:41.150 --> 05:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
makes one eligible for the program is
 
05:36:44.090 --> 05:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
not distinguished between adult patients
 
05:36:46.670 --> 05:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
and minor patients so the list that you
 
05:36:49.070 --> 05:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
saw in the last bill of the list or the
 
05:36:52.010 --> 05:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
partial list is the list that um the
 
05:36:54.230 --> 05:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
kids are being certified for
 
05:36:56.090 --> 05:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
is that is that the answer to your
 
05:36:58.850 --> 05:36:58.860 align:start position:0%

cannabis medical oversight board I will
 
05:37:36.410 --> 05:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
not take up a lot of your time but I do
 
05:37:39.530 --> 05:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
want to express the importance between
 
05:37:42.830 --> 05:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
these two elements that this bill is
 
05:37:44.650 --> 05:37:44.660 align:start position:0%
asking to change
 
05:37:48.230 --> 05:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
I will tell you that there literally is
 
05:37:51.708 --> 05:37:51.718 align:start position:0%
a handful of individuals within the
 
05:37:54.708 --> 05:37:54.718 align:start position:0%
state of the New Hampshire that will or
 
05:37:57.830 --> 05:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
have certified patients for therapeutic
 
05:37:57.840 --> 05:37:59.288 align:start position:0%
have certified patients for therapeutic
cannabis

05:37:59.288 --> 05:37:59.298 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
05:38:02.750 --> 05:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
the idea behind this is something that I
 
05:38:05.690 --> 05:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
have felt very passionately about for a
 
05:38:08.930 --> 05:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
multitude of reasons we held a listening
 
05:38:11.530 --> 05:38:11.540 align:start position:0%
session where we invited the public
 
05:38:14.270 --> 05:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
professionals patients Foreigner
 
05:38:16.788 --> 05:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
patients hopefully new patients to come
 
05:38:19.490 --> 05:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
in and talk to us the issues that were
 
05:38:23.570 --> 05:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
raised most were accessibility and
 
05:38:26.570 --> 05:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
affordability were two of the top things
 
05:38:28.628 --> 05:38:28.638 align:start position:0%
this takes care of
 
05:38:31.970 --> 05:38:31.980 align:start position:0%
touches on the accessibility part it is
 
05:38:34.310 --> 05:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
very difficult in the state of New
 
05:38:37.368 --> 05:38:37.378 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be a patient and have to go
 
05:38:40.788 --> 05:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
and shop around to find literally shop
 
05:38:42.770 --> 05:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
around make phone call after phone call
 
05:38:45.650 --> 05:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
after phone call to find a professional
 
05:38:47.510 --> 05:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
a medical professional that would be
 
05:38:49.970 --> 05:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
willing to work with you that is
 
05:38:52.190 --> 05:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
qualified under the statute to actually
 
05:38:54.250 --> 05:38:54.260 align:start position:0%
give you a certification
 
05:38:56.810 --> 05:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I've seen several cases
 
05:38:59.050 --> 05:38:59.060 align:start position:0%
where that has led to
 
05:39:02.990 --> 05:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
individuals that will certify but
 
05:39:05.570 --> 05:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
because certification is not covered
 
05:39:10.250 --> 05:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
under a medical insurance for those that
 
05:39:13.310 --> 05:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
do have medical insurance they are able
 
05:39:16.310 --> 05:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
to charge individuals in exorbitant
 
05:39:18.948 --> 05:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
amount of money just to receive a
 
05:39:21.230 --> 05:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
certification I've had reports of
 
05:39:23.628 --> 05:39:23.638 align:start position:0%
patients having to pay in excess of five
 
05:39:27.530 --> 05:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
to six hundred dollars just to go in and
 
05:39:30.470 --> 05:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
see a provider to get this piece of
 
05:39:32.690 --> 05:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
paper signed a piece of paper signed
 
05:39:36.050 --> 05:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
that says we are certifying you to try
 
05:39:38.750 --> 05:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis that is absolutely
 
05:39:38.760 --> 05:39:40.150 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis that is absolutely
ridiculous

05:39:40.150 --> 05:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
 
05:39:44.208 --> 05:39:44.218 align:start position:0%
by opening up the statue and allowing
 
05:39:46.430 --> 05:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
for any medical professional that
 
05:39:48.410 --> 05:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
possesses that number to be able to
 
05:39:50.930 --> 05:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
certify a patient you are taking
 
05:39:55.670 --> 05:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
barriers away that will allow again for
 
05:39:57.470 --> 05:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
patients to develop a better
 
05:40:00.410 --> 05:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
relationship with medical providers to
 
05:40:02.510 --> 05:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
allow patients to feel comfortable to
 
05:40:04.070 --> 05:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
have conversations with medical
 
05:40:07.010 --> 05:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
providers and to allow for the exchange
 
05:40:10.368 --> 05:40:10.378 align:start position:0%
of information and even to a degree a
 
05:40:13.190 --> 05:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
level of education for both medical
 
05:40:17.470 --> 05:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
providers and patients alike
 
05:40:22.128 --> 05:40:22.138 align:start position:0%
I as far is the second part of this bill
 
05:40:25.070 --> 05:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
goes it's
 
05:40:28.190 --> 05:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
I personally myself have always been
 
05:40:30.830 --> 05:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
against creating barriers whether we're
 
05:40:33.708 --> 05:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
speaking in regards to Children's Health
 
05:40:35.890 --> 05:40:35.900 align:start position:0%
Care or adult health care
 
05:40:40.070 --> 05:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
I was able to develop in my own mind a
 
05:40:42.830 --> 05:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
compromise by accepting this I
 
05:40:45.288 --> 05:40:45.298 align:start position:0%
personally wish that we didn't have to
 
05:40:46.970 --> 05:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
put our children through our families
 
05:40:48.770 --> 05:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
through the process of trying to find
 
05:40:52.250 --> 05:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
not one provider but two providers to
 
05:40:55.490 --> 05:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
sign the certification but again this is
 
05:40:59.410 --> 05:40:59.420 align:start position:0%
a compromise because where there are so
 
05:41:02.750 --> 05:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
limited amounts of certifying
 
05:41:05.868 --> 05:41:05.878 align:start position:0%
pediatricians or individuals in the
 
05:41:07.910 --> 05:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
state that are willing to certify as a
 
05:41:10.610 --> 05:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
pediatrician this will allow families
 
05:41:13.970 --> 05:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
another option another place in another
 
05:41:16.368 --> 05:41:16.378 align:start position:0%
area to search out treatment for their
 
05:41:16.378 --> 05:41:17.170 align:start position:0%
area to search out treatment for their
children

05:41:17.170 --> 05:41:17.180 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:41:19.670 --> 05:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
both of these changes I find are
 
05:41:24.110 --> 05:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
necessary and long overdue and I look
 
05:41:25.730 --> 05:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
forward to answering any any questions
 
05:41:28.010 --> 05:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
that you may have thank you questions
 
05:41:30.770 --> 05:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
yes representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
05:41:32.570 --> 05:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
05:41:34.250 --> 05:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
you've been involved with this process
 
05:41:36.050 --> 05:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
for a long time so I'm hoping you could
 
05:41:37.788 --> 05:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
answer my question
 
05:41:41.208 --> 05:41:41.218 align:start position:0%
um why two pedia pediatric people why do
 
05:41:45.230 --> 05:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:45.240 --> 05:41:46.310 align:start position:0%
 
well

05:41:46.310 --> 05:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:41:49.250 --> 05:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
um and anyone in the back Mr Holt could
 
05:41:52.610 --> 05:41:52.620 align:start position:0%
correct me if I am wrong but to my
 
05:41:54.590 --> 05:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge that decision was made because
 
05:41:54.600 --> 05:41:57.050 align:start position:0%
knowledge that decision was made because
of

05:41:57.050 --> 05:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:41:58.850 --> 05:41:58.860 align:start position:0%
probably not going to use the right
 
05:42:04.430 --> 05:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
terms but you know where we do know that
 
05:42:08.090 --> 05:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
cannabis can have a potential effect in
 
05:42:11.570 --> 05:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
adolescence I think the thought behind
 
05:42:11.580 --> 05:42:12.368 align:start position:0%
adolescence I think the thought behind
it

05:42:12.368 --> 05:42:12.378 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:42:16.670 --> 05:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
was so that everybody was making the
 
05:42:19.310 --> 05:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
right decision for that particular child
 
05:42:22.430 --> 05:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
I think it was like a system of checks
 
05:42:26.330 --> 05:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:29.510 --> 05:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
again find that it's a system of
 
05:42:32.090 --> 05:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
redundancy and maybe could is
 
05:42:33.890 --> 05:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
unnecessary but
 
05:42:36.470 --> 05:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
by opening up the statue and and
 
05:42:39.890 --> 05:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
changing who we allow to certify and
 
05:42:42.110 --> 05:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
changing that language to a family
 
05:42:44.810 --> 05:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
practice provider or someone that
 
05:42:48.470 --> 05:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
provides pediatric care I think that
 
05:42:54.288 --> 05:42:54.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:57.110 --> 05:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative Weber
 
05:42:59.390 --> 05:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
would you also agree with me that in
 
05:43:02.470 --> 05:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
addition to your very thoughtful and
 
05:43:06.050 --> 05:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
complete answer the other reason for the
 
05:43:09.230 --> 05:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
two providers there was that we needed
 
05:43:11.390 --> 05:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
to get this bill not only past the house
 
05:43:13.490 --> 05:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
but also past the Senate and get it
 
05:43:15.288 --> 05:43:15.298 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor
 
05:43:17.750 --> 05:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
whichever Governor it was at the time
 
05:43:20.810 --> 05:43:20.820 align:start position:0%
which has always been an issue
 
05:43:23.570 --> 05:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your question
 
05:43:23.580 --> 05:43:24.288 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your question
um

05:43:24.288 --> 05:43:24.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:27.530 --> 05:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
if I can speak honestly yes most
 
05:43:31.850 --> 05:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
definitely I think fear it has been a
 
05:43:37.250 --> 05:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
huge driver of this particular vehicle I
 
05:43:40.490 --> 05:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
think that fear comes from again lack of
 
05:43:42.708 --> 05:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
understanding education knowledge
 
05:43:46.850 --> 05:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to label it as I think
 
05:43:49.310 --> 05:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
that because the program has been so
 
05:43:52.430 --> 05:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
successful for so many years that you
 
05:43:56.090 --> 05:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
know we as patience has families has
 
05:43:58.970 --> 05:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
parents as individuals we have been able
 
05:44:01.610 --> 05:44:01.620 align:start position:0%
to prove to the state time and time
 
05:44:04.610 --> 05:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
again that we are responsible with this
 
05:44:07.368 --> 05:44:07.378 align:start position:0%
program that this program works that
 
05:44:10.910 --> 05:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
this program helps that it changes lives
 
05:44:13.548 --> 05:44:13.558 align:start position:0%
for the better
 
05:44:16.430 --> 05:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
um and that you know maybe it might be
 
05:44:19.730 --> 05:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
time to loosen up some of these
 
05:44:22.910 --> 05:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions and to to make this an
 
05:44:25.910 --> 05:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
available health choice for those
 
05:44:27.708 --> 05:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
individuals that choose to access
 
05:44:30.110 --> 05:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis instead of creating
 
05:44:32.810 --> 05:44:32.820 align:start position:0%
barriers based on our own lack of
 
05:44:35.448 --> 05:44:35.458 align:start position:0%
understanding or possibly education of
 
05:44:35.458 --> 05:44:36.230 align:start position:0%
understanding or possibly education of
it

05:44:36.230 --> 05:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:44:40.788 --> 05:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:47.270 --> 05:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:50.390 --> 05:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
and the last person signed up is Dr
 
05:44:50.400 --> 05:45:00.590 align:start position:0%
and the last person signed up is Dr
johannan

05:45:00.590 --> 05:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:02.570 --> 05:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing me today Joe
 
05:45:04.850 --> 05:45:04.860 align:start position:0%
Hannon I'm speaking for myself I won't
 
05:45:06.288 --> 05:45:06.298 align:start position:0%
repeat anything that was said previously
 
05:45:08.030 --> 05:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
but I agree with pretty much most of
 
05:45:09.590 --> 05:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
what was said
 
05:45:12.410 --> 05:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
um I I will say that as someone who has
 
05:45:14.030 --> 05:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
a 16 year old son who is driving to his
 
05:45:15.230 --> 05:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
first dentist appointment by himself
 
05:45:16.970 --> 05:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
today it's not and it's his first adult
 
05:45:18.470 --> 05:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
dentist appointment he's usually going
 
05:45:20.030 --> 05:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
to a pediatrician he's still going to a
 
05:45:22.010 --> 05:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
pediatrician but
 
05:45:24.410 --> 05:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
um he'll be he won't be 18 when he goes
 
05:45:26.990 --> 05:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
off to college so he's definitely not
 
05:45:27.948 --> 05:45:27.958 align:start position:0%
going to have a pediatrician when he's
 
05:45:29.628 --> 05:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
away from home so this is something that
 
05:45:31.310 --> 05:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just affect my son for a few
 
05:45:32.930 --> 05:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
months or maybe a little longer for some
 
05:45:35.390 --> 05:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh young adults but many students to go
 
05:45:36.590 --> 05:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
to school in New Hampshire not
 
05:45:37.970 --> 05:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
everyone's 18 when they go away from
 
05:45:37.980 --> 05:45:38.810 align:start position:0%
everyone's 18 when they go away from
home

05:45:38.810 --> 05:45:38.820 align:start position:0%
home
 
05:45:40.730 --> 05:45:40.740 align:start position:0%
uh I could maybe answer some questions
 
05:45:43.430 --> 05:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
about being a podiatrist and prescribing
 
05:45:46.490 --> 05:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
um you know I like our the esteemed
 
05:45:47.810 --> 05:45:47.820 align:start position:0%
orthopedist on the on the commission
 
05:45:49.850 --> 05:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
committee uh I studied the whole body
 
05:45:51.410 --> 05:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
and and I know the purpose of all the
 
05:45:52.910 --> 05:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
organs I know that the heart is supposed
 
05:45:56.150 --> 05:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:58.788 --> 05:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
um and I was fully licensed at a DEA
 
05:46:00.708 --> 05:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
number licensed prescribed narcotic
 
05:46:02.810 --> 05:46:02.820 align:start position:0%
medication to patients uh in training I
 
05:46:04.910 --> 05:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
even gave fentanyl lollipops a pediatric
 
05:46:06.470 --> 05:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
patients with severe burns to the low
 
05:46:10.070 --> 05:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
extremities so um I had a DA dispensing
 
05:46:12.230 --> 05:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
license as a podiatrist so I was able to
 
05:46:13.730 --> 05:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
I didn't do it because it was not
 
05:46:15.288 --> 05:46:15.298 align:start position:0%
something I really want to do but I had
 
05:46:16.850 --> 05:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
the ability if I wanted to to give out
 
05:46:18.890 --> 05:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
narcotics from my office
 
05:46:20.810 --> 05:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
so there are other providers who are
 
05:46:22.128 --> 05:46:22.138 align:start position:0%
more than capable and have the
 
05:46:25.430 --> 05:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
experience and knowledge to do as at
 
05:46:27.590 --> 05:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
least as much as a nurse practitioner or
 
05:46:30.410 --> 05:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
another provider can do that's already
 
05:46:33.530 --> 05:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
allowed to certify patients um and I'd
 
05:46:35.150 --> 05:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions and
 
05:46:37.070 --> 05:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say
 
05:46:41.150 --> 05:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for Dr Hannon
 
05:46:43.788 --> 05:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
I'm saying no questions
 
05:46:46.430 --> 05:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:48.110 --> 05:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
I have no one else signed up to speak
 
05:46:53.330 --> 05:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to speak on HP 610
 
05:46:55.128 --> 05:46:55.138 align:start position:0%

05:46:58.310 --> 05:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
public hearing on hb610 and open the
 
05:47:02.030 --> 05:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB 431 and invite the
 
05:47:03.770 --> 05:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative Wendy

05:47:06.958 --> 05:47:10.250 align:start position:0%
Thomas to come and testify

05:47:10.250 --> 05:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:12.890 --> 05:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
okay okay great thank you and we don't
 
05:47:17.930 --> 05:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:20.030 --> 05:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
another cannabis bill
 
05:47:23.150 --> 05:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the committee to
 
05:47:24.708 --> 05:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
remind you I am representative Wendy
 
05:47:26.990 --> 05:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
Thomas I represent the town of Merrimack
 
05:47:28.910 --> 05:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
and I come before you today to present
 
05:47:31.788 --> 05:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
House Bill 431 which is permitting
 
05:47:34.368 --> 05:47:34.378 align:start position:0%
qualifying patients and designated
 
05:47:36.890 --> 05:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
caregivers to cultivate cannabis for
 
05:47:38.390 --> 05:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use
 
05:47:40.368 --> 05:47:40.378 align:start position:0%
as a reminder I am a New Hampshire
 
05:47:42.890 --> 05:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patient I use
 
05:47:45.890 --> 05:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
cannabis on a daily basis for pain and
 
05:47:48.708 --> 05:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
illness I take those micro doses that
 
05:47:51.410 --> 05:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
were referred to earlier
 
05:47:52.970 --> 05:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow New Hampshire
 
05:47:55.250 --> 05:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients or a
 
05:47:57.650 --> 05:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
designated caregiver to grow cannabis
 
05:48:00.650 --> 05:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
plants at their residence it would allow
 
05:48:02.448 --> 05:48:02.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire therapeutic cannabis
 
05:48:05.448 --> 05:48:05.458 align:start position:0%
patients to have and grow Three Mature
 
05:48:07.490 --> 05:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
which are flowering plants
 
05:48:10.190 --> 05:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
three immature which are non-flowering
 
05:48:12.708 --> 05:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
plants and 12 seedlings which are
 
05:48:15.590 --> 05:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
defined as six inches tall or less
 
05:48:17.390 --> 05:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow them to grow
 
05:48:19.670 --> 05:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis at their place of residence and
 
05:48:22.128 --> 05:48:22.138 align:start position:0%
consume the Cannabis that they grow
 
05:48:23.930 --> 05:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
by growing their own cannabis the
 
05:48:25.788 --> 05:48:25.798 align:start position:0%
patient can choose which effective
 
05:48:28.128 --> 05:48:28.138 align:start position:0%
strains to grow and they would say a
 
05:48:30.708 --> 05:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
cost savings for their medication
 
05:48:32.810 --> 05:48:32.820 align:start position:0%
recently when the therapeutic cannabis
 
05:48:35.390 --> 05:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board met they voted
 
05:48:38.270 --> 05:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
to unanimously support this bill
 
05:48:41.270 --> 05:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
so reasons for home cultivation
 
05:48:44.030 --> 05:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
secure home cultivation is not causing
 
05:48:45.288 --> 05:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
any problems
 
05:48:48.288 --> 05:48:48.298 align:start position:0%
14 of the 18 states that have legalized
 
05:48:50.510 --> 05:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
adult use cannabis and about half of the
 
05:48:52.670 --> 05:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis states allow for
 
05:48:56.030 --> 05:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
personal cultivate cultivation
 
05:48:57.890 --> 05:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
in the states that have reasonable
 
05:49:00.770 --> 05:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
safeguards home cultivation has not been
 
05:49:04.010 --> 05:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
a problem no state has repealed home
 
05:49:04.020 --> 05:49:05.990 align:start position:0%
a problem no state has repealed home
cultivation

05:49:05.990 --> 05:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
cultivation
 
05:49:08.030 --> 05:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
home cultivation is important for
 
05:49:10.128 --> 05:49:10.138 align:start position:0%
patients about six percent of Americans
 
05:49:12.530 --> 05:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
use cannabis for therapeutic reasons
 
05:49:16.610 --> 05:49:16.620 align:start position:0%
insurance does not cover cannabis for
 
05:49:18.708 --> 05:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
many people with serious medical
 
05:49:21.048 --> 05:49:21.058 align:start position:0%
conditions medical expenses and a
 
05:49:23.090 --> 05:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
reduced ability to work make getting
 
05:49:24.770 --> 05:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
cannabis difficult
 
05:49:27.288 --> 05:49:27.298 align:start position:0%
by allowing home cultivation you are
 
05:49:28.670 --> 05:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
giving the therapeutic patients
 
05:49:30.948 --> 05:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
Financial relief for their non-insurance
 
05:49:32.930 --> 05:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
covered medicine
 
05:49:35.448 --> 05:49:35.458 align:start position:0%
home cultivation helps to displace the
 
05:49:37.010 --> 05:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
illicit Market
 
05:49:40.010 --> 05:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
some patients need more some patients
 
05:49:42.230 --> 05:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
don't have the financial means to prep
 
05:49:44.930 --> 05:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
to purchase tested and measured cannabis
 
05:49:47.330 --> 05:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
from the dispensaries home cultivation
 
05:49:49.368 --> 05:49:49.378 align:start position:0%
would allow those patients access to
 
05:49:51.590 --> 05:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis without having to use the
 
05:49:53.930 --> 05:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
illicit Market
 
05:49:56.090 --> 05:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
home cultivation is consistent with our
 
05:49:58.490 --> 05:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
commitment to freedom and equality
 
05:50:00.830 --> 05:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
in a free society and a state with a
 
05:50:03.470 --> 05:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
motto Live Free or Die adults should be
 
05:50:05.150 --> 05:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to grow cannabis plants in their
 
05:50:08.030 --> 05:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
homes for therapeutic use
 
05:50:09.890 --> 05:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
a little bit about what other states are
 
05:50:11.868 --> 05:50:11.878 align:start position:0%
doing in Connecticut it is legal for
 
05:50:13.730 --> 05:50:13.740 align:start position:0%
patients to have up to Three Mature
 
05:50:15.708 --> 05:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
plants and three immature plants in
 
05:50:17.868 --> 05:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
Maine it is legal for patients to have
 
05:50:21.230 --> 05:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
six flowering plants two immature plants
 
05:50:23.750 --> 05:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
and unlimited seedlings in Massachusetts
 
05:50:26.030 --> 05:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
you're allowed six plants per person
 
05:50:29.948 --> 05:50:29.958 align:start position:0%
person or patient no more than Twelve
 
05:50:32.990 --> 05:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island it's legal for patients up
 
05:50:35.750 --> 05:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
to 12 mature plants and 12 immature
 
05:50:37.788 --> 05:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
plants per patient and in Vermont you
 
05:50:39.590 --> 05:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
can have two mature plants and seven
 
05:50:42.170 --> 05:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
immature plants per patient
 
05:50:44.930 --> 05:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
since 2009 the New Hampshire house has
 
05:50:46.788 --> 05:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
consistently supported bills allowing
 
05:50:48.890 --> 05:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
patients with qualifying medical
 
05:50:50.868 --> 05:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
conditions and their caregivers to
 
05:50:52.970 --> 05:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
cultivate a limited supply of cannabis
 
05:50:56.570 --> 05:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
in 2012 and 2019 the Senate agreed
 
05:50:59.150 --> 05:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
advancing home grow legislation to the
 
05:51:01.910 --> 05:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
governor's desk both bills were vetoed
 
05:51:04.010 --> 05:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
and the override efforts fell short in
 
05:51:05.330 --> 05:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
05:51:07.730 --> 05:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the Senate passed a home grow
 
05:51:10.610 --> 05:51:10.620 align:start position:0%
bill in a Voice vote but the outbreak of
 
05:51:12.470 --> 05:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
covid-19 prevented it from being
 
05:51:14.628 --> 05:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
considered in the house
 
05:51:17.270 --> 05:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
finally there is an amendment for this
 
05:51:21.170 --> 05:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
bill I've sent it around it is a draft
 
05:51:23.628 --> 05:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
and it corrects some drafting errors
 
05:51:25.548 --> 05:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
from OLS first of all it corrects some
 
05:51:29.390 --> 05:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
outdated rsas that were referenced when
 
05:51:32.090 --> 05:51:32.100 align:start position:0%
we tighten up the security language the
 
05:51:34.368 --> 05:51:34.378 align:start position:0%
phrase at the person's residence was
 
05:51:36.770 --> 05:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
inadvertently removed this is language
 
05:51:38.750 --> 05:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
that the police wanted in there and it
 
05:51:40.490 --> 05:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
was an error that it was removed the
 
05:51:42.410 --> 05:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
amendment would put it back in
 
05:51:44.330 --> 05:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
the date for the Department to allow
 
05:51:46.430 --> 05:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
existing and new qualifying patients and
 
05:51:48.948 --> 05:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
caregivers to to designate a cultivation
 
05:51:51.530 --> 05:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
location has been moved in the amendment
 
05:51:55.850 --> 05:51:55.860 align:start position:0%
from October 2023 to December 1st 2023.
 
05:51:57.430 --> 05:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
this was in
 
05:51:59.990 --> 05:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
consultation with the department and
 
05:52:02.090 --> 05:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
gives them more time in the event that
 
05:52:04.850 --> 05:52:04.860 align:start position:0%
the bill is passed after a veto
 
05:52:07.190 --> 05:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
the draft I've passed out still has some
 
05:52:09.470 --> 05:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
errors from OLS and Mr Holt will speak
 
05:52:12.110 --> 05:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
to those issues when he testifies thank
 
05:52:21.730 --> 05:52:21.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:24.470 --> 05:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thank you chairman just out
 
05:52:26.990 --> 05:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
of curiosity where do you go to get the
 
05:52:28.730 --> 05:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
the seedlings
 
05:52:32.270 --> 05:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
for the home cultivation so
 
05:52:35.030 --> 05:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
first of all you can buy seeds the FDA
 
05:52:36.650 --> 05:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
has declared that that seeds are
 
05:52:38.570 --> 05:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
available cannabis seeds because they do
 
05:52:41.030 --> 05:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
not contain THC so you could buy seeds
 
05:52:43.310 --> 05:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
and you could grow your own there is
 
05:52:45.230 --> 05:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
some discussion with the dispensaries
 
05:52:47.890 --> 05:52:47.900 align:start position:0%
that they will provide seedlings
 
05:52:51.350 --> 05:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
that's to be developed with each
 
05:52:53.810 --> 05:52:53.820 align:start position:0%
dispensary but that's that's an option
 
05:52:56.208 --> 05:52:56.218 align:start position:0%
that could be available but I would
 
05:52:59.448 --> 05:52:59.458 align:start position:0%
think mostly from seeds you're welcome
 
05:53:02.150 --> 05:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
05:53:04.910 --> 05:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
chairman uh seen an article recently
 
05:53:07.730 --> 05:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
about Montpelier Vermont there was a
 
05:53:07.740 --> 05:53:09.230 align:start position:0%
about Montpelier Vermont there was a
contaminated

05:53:09.230 --> 05:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
contaminated
 
05:53:11.570 --> 05:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
um batch of cannabis that was recalled
 
05:53:13.430 --> 05:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
from their state
 
05:53:13.440 --> 05:53:14.628 align:start position:0%
from their state
um

05:53:14.628 --> 05:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:18.610 --> 05:53:18.620 align:start position:0%
uh their state program
 
05:53:22.368 --> 05:53:22.378 align:start position:0%
is this is this bill something that can
 
05:53:25.670 --> 05:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
prevent people being exposed to bad
 
05:53:27.948 --> 05:53:27.958 align:start position:0%
batches of cannabis that may be at the
 
05:53:27.958 --> 05:53:29.330 align:start position:0%
batches of cannabis that may be at the
atcs

05:53:29.330 --> 05:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
atcs
 
05:53:31.128 --> 05:53:31.138 align:start position:0%
um theoretically it could but in New
 
05:53:33.170 --> 05:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all of the Cannabis is tested
 
05:53:36.110 --> 05:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
prior to it being available to patients
 
05:53:38.570 --> 05:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to guess that there was a
 
05:53:41.930 --> 05:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
mold issue perhaps with the Cannabis so
 
05:53:44.090 --> 05:53:44.100 align:start position:0%
that would be tested for so so you're
 
05:53:45.708 --> 05:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
not going to see that in in the
 
05:53:45.718 --> 05:53:47.150 align:start position:0%
not going to see that in in the
dispensaries

05:53:47.150 --> 05:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
dispensaries
 
05:53:49.788 --> 05:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
um with plants you know this is not
 
05:53:52.128 --> 05:53:52.138 align:start position:0%
growing your daddy's tomato plants you
 
05:53:54.110 --> 05:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
know it takes a little bit of time a
 
05:53:56.690 --> 05:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
little bit of effort mold can be an
 
05:53:58.190 --> 05:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
issue you know but that's going to kill
 
05:54:00.890 --> 05:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
the plants uh so you know you're going
 
05:54:05.330 --> 05:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:07.670 --> 05:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:54:11.628 --> 05:54:11.638 align:start position:0%
yes representative oh fault
 
05:54:13.190 --> 05:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so we
 
05:54:15.470 --> 05:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
we have heard a good deal so you you
 
05:54:16.868 --> 05:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about
 
05:54:19.010 --> 05:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
costs yeah
 
05:54:21.708 --> 05:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
um we've heard a good deal in when we
 
05:54:24.048 --> 05:54:24.058 align:start position:0%
hear about other bills about
 
05:54:26.390 --> 05:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
access and particularly people who live
 
05:54:29.150 --> 05:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
in the North Country so can you speak to
 
05:54:32.750 --> 05:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
the location of these dispensaries and
 
05:54:35.270 --> 05:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
the effect that that has on
 
05:54:36.650 --> 05:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
um people who may live in the North
 
05:54:38.390 --> 05:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
country or elsewhere well you should
 
05:54:39.890 --> 05:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
have been here four years ago when I
 
05:54:43.490 --> 05:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
presented a bill on that very topic and
 
05:54:44.628 --> 05:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
because of the bill two more
 
05:54:46.190 --> 05:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
dispensaries were opened up in the state
 
05:54:47.590 --> 05:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
05:54:49.730 --> 05:54:49.740 align:start position:0%
particularly in the North Country this
 
05:54:53.110 --> 05:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
this bill would help patients up there
 
05:54:55.250 --> 05:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
some of those patients have to drive
 
05:54:57.708 --> 05:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
almost an hour to get to a dispensary
 
05:54:59.390 --> 05:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
and you're limited in how much you can
 
05:55:01.850 --> 05:55:01.860 align:start position:0%
get so this would certainly help those
 
05:55:04.910 --> 05:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
patients and again you know cannabis
 
05:55:07.548 --> 05:55:07.558 align:start position:0%
is not cheap it's not cheap you know I
 
05:55:09.350 --> 05:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
take micro doses so a little bit you
 
05:55:11.270 --> 05:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
know goes a long way but there are some
 
05:55:13.250 --> 05:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
patients that have significant health
 
05:55:16.010 --> 05:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
issues that that need a fair amount on a
 
05:55:18.110 --> 05:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
daily basis and that that can be
 
05:55:18.120 --> 05:55:19.250 align:start position:0%
daily basis and that that can be
expensive

05:55:19.250 --> 05:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
05:55:22.190 --> 05:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
one other thing to remember or to to
 
05:55:24.590 --> 05:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
know perhaps you don't know this is that
 
05:55:26.930 --> 05:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
if you grow the cannabis plant it's the
 
05:55:29.628 --> 05:55:29.638 align:start position:0%
bud it's the flowering Bud that uh that
 
05:55:33.650 --> 05:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
is used and it has to be decarboxylated
 
05:55:36.170 --> 05:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
so you can't you know there's no there's
 
05:55:38.990 --> 05:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
no danger of somebody rubbing against
 
05:55:41.930 --> 05:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
the plant and getting euphoric there's
 
05:55:44.810 --> 05:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
no danger of your dog eating the flower
 
05:55:47.510 --> 05:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
they'll probably be very calm but
 
05:55:50.208 --> 05:55:50.218 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be euphoric the
 
05:55:52.730 --> 05:55:52.740 align:start position:0%
reason the way that you decarboxylate is
 
05:55:55.310 --> 05:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
you apply heat which is why people smoke
 
05:55:55.320 --> 05:55:58.070 align:start position:0%
you apply heat which is why people smoke
cannabis

05:55:58.070 --> 05:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
05:56:01.310 --> 05:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other questions
 
05:56:08.390 --> 05:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:11.270 --> 05:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Jerry canark
 
05:56:31.730 --> 05:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:31.740 --> 05:56:33.288 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:56:33.288 --> 05:56:33.298 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:56:34.910 --> 05:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chair and for the
 
05:56:36.530 --> 05:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
record again Jerry chair of the
 
05:56:38.090 --> 05:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
05:56:38.100 --> 05:56:39.770 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
board

05:56:39.770 --> 05:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:56:41.150 --> 05:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the stuff in my written
 
05:56:42.708 --> 05:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
testimony I can skip because you've
 
05:56:44.810 --> 05:56:44.820 align:start position:0%
already covered it basically the issue
 
05:56:48.288 --> 05:56:48.298 align:start position:0%
is when a person is approved to be a
 
05:56:50.150 --> 05:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
qualifying patient there is student
 
05:56:52.128 --> 05:56:52.138 align:start position:0%
registry ID card that allows them access
 
05:56:54.830 --> 05:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
to an ATC and that's where they are
 
05:56:56.690 --> 05:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
counseled regarding appropriate strains
 
05:56:58.250 --> 05:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
and routes of administration and they
 
05:56:59.868 --> 05:56:59.878 align:start position:0%
obtain their therapeutic cannabis
 
05:57:02.690 --> 05:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
currently patients cannot grow their own
 
05:57:04.730 --> 05:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
05:57:06.288 --> 05:57:06.298 align:start position:0%
now it's important to realize that
 
05:57:08.868 --> 05:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
cannabis is not just one compound it's
 
05:57:11.330 --> 05:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
not one drug it's a botanical
 
05:57:13.730 --> 05:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
as a result it contains hundreds of
 
05:57:15.948 --> 05:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
different chemicals different cannabis
 
05:57:17.628 --> 05:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
strains have different cannabinoid
 
05:57:19.548 --> 05:57:19.558 align:start position:0%
profiles most notably the concentrations
 
05:57:21.830 --> 05:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
of THC that's the major intoxicating
 
05:57:23.990 --> 05:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
component and CBD which is
 
05:57:24.000 --> 05:57:25.970 align:start position:0%
component and CBD which is
non-intoxicating

05:57:25.970 --> 05:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
non-intoxicating
 
05:57:28.368 --> 05:57:28.378 align:start position:0%
terpenes they're responsible for the
 
05:57:31.128 --> 05:57:31.138 align:start position:0%
aroma of plants they also vary among
 
05:57:33.590 --> 05:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
strains and they modify the response to
 
05:57:35.990 --> 05:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
the cannabinoids and the synergistic
 
05:57:38.030 --> 05:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
effect of the cannabinoids and the
 
05:57:40.250 --> 05:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
terpenes is called the Entourage effect
 
05:57:41.990 --> 05:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
and that gives different strains
 
05:57:45.230 --> 05:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
different effects upon symptoms so
 
05:57:46.670 --> 05:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
patients often need to try different
 
05:57:48.530 --> 05:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
strains for a while to get one that'll
 
05:57:50.390 --> 05:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
give the desired effect upon their
 
05:57:53.270 --> 05:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
symptoms once they find what works they
 
05:57:55.430 --> 05:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
need to stick with it that can sometimes
 
05:57:57.650 --> 05:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
be a problem because an ATC may drop a
 
05:57:59.810 --> 05:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
strain due to low demand leaving a
 
05:58:02.150 --> 05:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
patient without access also there was
 
05:58:03.470 --> 05:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
that comment a moment ago about access
 
05:58:06.048 --> 05:58:06.058 align:start position:0%
to in general to the atcs and indeed it
 
05:58:07.970 --> 05:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
is quite a ways for a lot of us anywhere
 
05:58:09.830 --> 05:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
but specifically in the North country
 
05:58:12.110 --> 05:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
so last year the tcmov held a listening
 
05:58:13.850 --> 05:58:13.860 align:start position:0%
session for feedback from patients about
 
05:58:15.830 --> 05:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
the functioning of the program the most
 
05:58:17.868 --> 05:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
common concerns were affordability of
 
05:58:20.750 --> 05:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
the products accessibility of the atcs
 
05:58:23.330 --> 05:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
and availability of this specific strain
 
05:58:24.890 --> 05:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
needed by a patient to treat their
 
05:58:27.530 --> 05:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
symptoms which may not be available in
 
05:58:29.570 --> 05:58:29.580 align:start position:0%
their nearest ATC
 
05:58:32.390 --> 05:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
several patients who spoke to us felt
 
05:58:34.190 --> 05:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
that home cultivation could at least
 
05:58:37.730 --> 05:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
partially address many of these concerns
 
05:58:41.270 --> 05:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
that is January 2023 meeting tcmob voted
 
05:58:43.310 --> 05:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
unanimously that it agrees with the
 
05:58:45.470 --> 05:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
concept of Home cultivation of
 
05:58:47.330 --> 05:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis biotherapeutic
 
05:58:49.730 --> 05:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
cannabis patients and caregivers to help
 
05:58:52.548 --> 05:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
with accessibility affordability and
 
05:58:55.310 --> 05:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
strain availability I do have a few
 
05:58:57.230 --> 05:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
specific points I'll Express but at this
 
05:58:58.850 --> 05:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
point understand that I'm now speaking
 
05:59:02.390 --> 05:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
for myself not tcmob as we voted in the
 
05:59:04.910 --> 05:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
concept of Home cultivation but we did
 
05:59:07.128 --> 05:59:07.138 align:start position:0%
not go into the Weeds on specifics of
 
05:59:08.690 --> 05:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
the language
 
05:59:10.670 --> 05:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
okay good you're paying attention I I
 
05:59:12.350 --> 05:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
use the train same trick last year on
 
05:59:13.490 --> 05:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
the floor too
 
05:59:16.670 --> 05:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
um anyway the point is that the bill has
 
05:59:17.930 --> 05:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
a lot of really good features such as
 
05:59:19.788 --> 05:59:19.798 align:start position:0%
allowing a patient who cultivates to be
 
05:59:21.350 --> 05:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
able to submit their cannabis to a lab
 
05:59:23.208 --> 05:59:23.218 align:start position:0%
for testing that's great because it
 
05:59:24.948 --> 05:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
allows them to get their cannabinoid
 
05:59:26.868 --> 05:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
profile and to ensure safety with
 
05:59:29.030 --> 05:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
respect to contaminants the bill also
 
05:59:30.890 --> 05:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
has robust protections with respect to
 
05:59:32.930 --> 05:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
limitations and the number of cannabis
 
05:59:34.548 --> 05:59:34.558 align:start position:0%
plants the registration of cultivation
 
05:59:37.070 --> 05:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
sites that must be enclosed and locked
 
05:59:38.990 --> 05:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
these protections will make home
 
05:59:41.628 --> 05:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
cultivation safe and secure and
 
05:59:43.788 --> 05:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
controlled and should satisfy the
 
05:59:45.708 --> 05:59:45.718 align:start position:0%
concerns of law enforcement it's
 
05:59:47.270 --> 05:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
important to realize that an awful lot
 
05:59:49.070 --> 05:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
of patients will probably not grow their
 
05:59:51.230 --> 05:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
own some will not have the space some
 
05:59:53.448 --> 05:59:53.458 align:start position:0%
will not have the skill I would suggest
 
05:59:55.430 --> 05:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
adding language also though to allow
 
05:59:57.830 --> 05:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
atcs to provide seeds and clones it
 
05:59:59.510 --> 05:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
currently says seedlings but will
 
06:00:01.730 --> 06:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
provide seeds and clones to patients to
 
06:00:03.170 --> 06:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
assist them in growing the specific
 
06:00:05.810 --> 06:00:05.820 align:start position:0%
strain they need for their condition I
 
06:00:08.030 --> 06:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
do disagree with one issue page six
 
06:00:10.368 --> 06:00:10.378 align:start position:0%
lines four through thirteen allows home
 
06:00:13.368 --> 06:00:13.378 align:start position:0%
cultivation for potential qualifying
 
06:00:15.470 --> 06:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
patients have not yet been granted a
 
06:00:17.448 --> 06:00:17.458 align:start position:0%
card this could be an enforcement
 
06:00:20.150 --> 06:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
nightmare again page six lines four to
 
06:00:22.070 --> 06:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
thirteen could be an enforcement night
 
06:00:23.810 --> 06:00:23.820 align:start position:0%
Nightmare and I feel that they can wait
 
06:00:25.368 --> 06:00:25.378 align:start position:0%
that short time until they get their
 
06:00:27.770 --> 06:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
card and we know their their location
 
06:00:29.690 --> 06:00:29.700 align:start position:0%
before they would be allowed to do it
 
06:00:31.788 --> 06:00:31.798 align:start position:0%
now I do not have a copy the amendment
 
06:00:33.530 --> 06:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
so I will not comment on that again and
 
06:00:35.810 --> 06:00:35.820 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking for tcmob primarily and we
 
06:00:37.850 --> 06:00:37.860 align:start position:0%
talked about the concept not the
 
06:00:39.530 --> 06:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
specific wording I will defer to my cult
 
06:00:41.270 --> 06:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
for a discussion of the particular
 
06:00:43.368 --> 06:00:43.378 align:start position:0%
problem so in summary allowing home
 
06:00:45.530 --> 06:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
cultivation of therapeutic cannabis by
 
06:00:47.628 --> 06:00:47.638 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis patients will
 
06:00:49.970 --> 06:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
be very helpful for our patients and
 
06:00:52.548 --> 06:00:52.558 align:start position:0%
addressing affordability accessibility
 
06:00:55.070 --> 06:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
and the availability of specific strains
 
06:00:57.948 --> 06:00:57.958 align:start position:0%
and uh Mike Holt and I would be glad to
 
06:00:59.390 --> 06:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
work with the committee on any needed
 
06:01:03.708 --> 06:01:03.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:06.830 --> 06:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
yes sir representative King
 
06:01:08.990 --> 06:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald when it
 
06:01:11.030 --> 06:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
comes to the and thank you by the way
 
06:01:12.470 --> 06:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the reasonable
 
06:01:16.310 --> 06:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
precautions and uh enclosed spaces that
 
06:01:17.628 --> 06:01:17.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't preclude being able to grow
 
06:01:19.548 --> 06:01:19.558 align:start position:0%
outdoors does it
 
06:01:21.830 --> 06:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
um well I for example I have a
 
06:01:23.628 --> 06:01:23.638 align:start position:0%
greenhouse I don't grow because it's not
 
06:01:25.610 --> 06:01:25.620 align:start position:0%
legal but I have a greenhouse if I could
 
06:01:27.230 --> 06:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
if I wanted to do so and I were a
 
06:01:29.330 --> 06:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
patient as long as I had a way to lock
 
06:01:31.250 --> 06:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
that that would be an enclosed it would
 
06:01:33.890 --> 06:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
be not visible without somebody ripping
 
06:01:35.868 --> 06:01:35.878 align:start position:0%
the plastic off and it could be locked
 
06:01:37.610 --> 06:01:37.620 align:start position:0%
so that's the whole issue it could be
 
06:01:39.410 --> 06:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
done outside and indeed it is a problem
 
06:01:41.208 --> 06:01:41.218 align:start position:0%
growing inside requires really high
 
06:01:43.430 --> 06:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
intensity lighting and a lot of costs
 
06:01:45.288 --> 06:01:45.298 align:start position:0%
that are there it's probably a little
 
06:01:46.730 --> 06:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
easier to control the environment than
 
06:01:48.890 --> 06:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
it is inside of a greenhouse but you're
 
06:01:51.048 --> 06:01:51.058 align:start position:0%
not going to see Farms or I mean big you
 
06:01:52.610 --> 06:01:52.620 align:start position:0%
know just out in the field somewhere
 
06:01:55.368 --> 06:01:55.378 align:start position:0%
because that's not enclosed and uh so on
 
06:01:58.788 --> 06:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
and so forth follow up follow up what
 
06:02:00.530 --> 06:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
about just a fenced-in area with
 
06:02:02.510 --> 06:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
sunlight but no Greenhouse is that okay
 
06:02:02.520 --> 06:02:03.530 align:start position:0%
sunlight but no Greenhouse is that okay
oh

06:02:03.530 --> 06:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
oh
 
06:02:03.540 --> 06:02:04.850 align:start position:0%
oh
[Music]

06:02:04.850 --> 06:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:02:04.860 --> 06:02:06.048 align:start position:0%
[Music]
see

06:02:06.048 --> 06:02:06.058 align:start position:0%
see
 
06:02:06.058 --> 06:02:06.770 align:start position:0%
see
um

06:02:06.770 --> 06:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:08.570 --> 06:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry can you remind me which which
 
06:02:10.490 --> 06:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
line that's on because I want to make
 
06:02:12.410 --> 06:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
sure that's in um
 
06:02:15.830 --> 06:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's uh lines five through nine on the
 
06:02:17.810 --> 06:02:17.820 align:start position:0%
first page
 
06:02:19.368 --> 06:02:19.378 align:start position:0%
um yeah okay
 
06:02:22.368 --> 06:02:22.378 align:start position:0%
yeah an enclosed lots of space I mean if
 
06:02:24.350 --> 06:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
it's just fenced that's I guess it could
 
06:02:26.510 --> 06:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
be locked but it would have to be not
 
06:02:28.010 --> 06:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
accessible so you'd have to have a
 
06:02:29.510 --> 06:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
pretty high fence
 
06:02:31.490 --> 06:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
um and you know but barbed wire or
 
06:02:33.048 --> 06:02:33.058 align:start position:0%
something like that probably
 
06:02:34.730 --> 06:02:34.740 align:start position:0%
I mean that could certainly be tidied up
 
06:02:37.368 --> 06:02:37.378 align:start position:0%
to make it enclosed and non-accessible
 
06:02:39.708 --> 06:02:39.718 align:start position:0%
if one wishes to add just a little bit
 
06:02:41.868 --> 06:02:41.878 align:start position:0%
more language to that thank you
 
06:02:43.368 --> 06:02:43.378 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy did you have a
 
06:02:44.510 --> 06:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
question or
 
06:02:47.270 --> 06:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you um
 
06:02:50.090 --> 06:02:50.100 align:start position:0%
Dr X rep you know connect
 
06:02:51.410 --> 06:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
um a simple question
 
06:02:53.270 --> 06:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
um we had a similar Bill last year in
 
06:02:54.470 --> 06:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
front of us about legalization of
 
06:02:56.690 --> 06:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
cannabis and one of the big concerns was
 
06:03:00.948 --> 06:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
that the availability would potentially
 
06:03:04.250 --> 06:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
compromise the therapeutic home or
 
06:03:06.650 --> 06:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program and the
 
06:03:08.570 --> 06:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
reason being was you know the the whole
 
06:03:10.788 --> 06:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
idea about counseling and education do
 
06:03:13.190 --> 06:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
you have any concerns that this would
 
06:03:16.310 --> 06:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
detract from that or be would would
 
06:03:18.288 --> 06:03:18.298 align:start position:0%
patients be less likely to participate
 
06:03:21.830 --> 06:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
in the education in counseling part of
 
06:03:23.930 --> 06:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
the program you know it's interesting uh
 
06:03:25.430 --> 06:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
when I first was thinking about this I
 
06:03:27.048 --> 06:03:27.058 align:start position:0%
did have some concerns about that that
 
06:03:28.850 --> 06:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
it would drive patients away from the
 
06:03:31.548 --> 06:03:31.558 align:start position:0%
atcs it turns out our atcs actually
 
06:03:33.470 --> 06:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
support this because they have a solid
 
06:03:36.230 --> 06:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
goal of trying to be sure that patients
 
06:03:39.110 --> 06:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
have access to therapeutic cannabis and
 
06:03:41.390 --> 06:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
they uh you know they're not just there
 
06:03:42.590 --> 06:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
to make a bunch of money they're there
 
06:03:44.090 --> 06:03:44.100 align:start position:0%
to actually make sure people have the
 
06:03:46.368 --> 06:03:46.378 align:start position:0%
access and they realize this may be a
 
06:03:48.048 --> 06:03:48.058 align:start position:0%
good way to do it
 
06:03:49.910 --> 06:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
um I can't speak for them but I know
 
06:03:52.010 --> 06:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
that um one of the representatives from
 
06:03:53.690 --> 06:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
Prime is here Matt Simon and we'll speak
 
06:03:56.570 --> 06:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
to their point of view on this
 
06:03:58.368 --> 06:03:58.378 align:start position:0%
um I think though probably patients will
 
06:04:00.110 --> 06:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
still start in the program so they can
 
06:04:02.690 --> 06:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
get counseled try find out what the
 
06:04:04.490 --> 06:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
strain is that works for them maybe find
 
06:04:06.410 --> 06:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
out that that's only available in some
 
06:04:07.788 --> 06:04:07.798 align:start position:0%
other part of the state and they don't
 
06:04:10.010 --> 06:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
want to go there so then they might get
 
06:04:13.190 --> 06:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
some seedlings or clones from that ATC
 
06:04:15.530 --> 06:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
which would be a way to still reimburse
 
06:04:18.170 --> 06:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
the ATC for their work and then start
 
06:04:19.788 --> 06:04:19.798 align:start position:0%
growing on their own so yes it might
 
06:04:21.288 --> 06:04:21.298 align:start position:0%
have them
 
06:04:23.510 --> 06:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
out of Constant Contact but they
 
06:04:25.070 --> 06:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
certainly might still touch back if they
 
06:04:27.410 --> 06:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
are having some issues
 
06:04:30.470 --> 06:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:36.910 --> 06:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:40.430 --> 06:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:40.440 --> 06:04:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:04:41.750 --> 06:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:04:43.730 --> 06:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
in all full disclosure I'm on the board
 
06:04:46.548 --> 06:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
of Temescal and we are non-profit we are
 
06:04:50.090 --> 06:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
not for-profit right so in the end um in
 
06:04:52.788 --> 06:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
theory the goal is the benefit of
 
06:04:55.128 --> 06:04:55.138 align:start position:0%
everybody yes that's what I mean these
 
06:04:56.750 --> 06:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
these are not people who are trying to
 
06:04:58.548 --> 06:04:58.558 align:start position:0%
gouge the patients these are these are
 
06:05:00.170 --> 06:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
organizations who are trying to do a
 
06:05:01.610 --> 06:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
good job of providing therapeutic
 
06:05:03.708 --> 06:05:03.718 align:start position:0%
cannabis and they see this as best I
 
06:05:05.208 --> 06:05:05.218 align:start position:0%
understand as a way to expand that but
 
06:05:07.190 --> 06:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
Matt Simon can discuss that better
 
06:05:10.250 --> 06:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
other questions representative whoever I
 
06:05:11.448 --> 06:05:11.458 align:start position:0%
would just have one other question
 
06:05:13.990 --> 06:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
because there was the concern that was
 
06:05:16.368 --> 06:05:16.378 align:start position:0%
uh asked about and that representative
 
06:05:20.570 --> 06:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
Thomas spoke about with a a batch of
 
06:05:22.430 --> 06:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
um therapeutic cannabis in Vermont was
 
06:05:27.048 --> 06:05:27.058 align:start position:0%
recalled but is it not true that just as
 
06:05:29.750 --> 06:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
there are potential issues that we have
 
06:05:32.590 --> 06:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
taken better steps to guard against here
 
06:05:35.570 --> 06:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
that it's also perfectly possible that
 
06:05:37.910 --> 06:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
somebody who is home growing can can
 
06:05:40.670 --> 06:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
wind up with mold or or some other
 
06:05:44.030 --> 06:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh thing so it's it's not
 
06:05:47.930 --> 06:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
a be-all an end-all Panacea it's another
 
06:05:51.048 --> 06:05:51.058 align:start position:0%
route to be explored with all the others
 
06:05:53.150 --> 06:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
yes I think so and indeed that's why I
 
06:05:54.470 --> 06:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
say a lot of people don't have the skill
 
06:05:57.410 --> 06:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
set I mean I I get problems with my
 
06:05:58.730 --> 06:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
plants that I grow both in my garden
 
06:06:00.110 --> 06:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
into my Greenhouse it can be a real
 
06:06:01.910 --> 06:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
nuisance sometimes they're recognizable
 
06:06:03.530 --> 06:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
but that is one of the good features of
 
06:06:05.628 --> 06:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
allowing the patient patients who are
 
06:06:07.970 --> 06:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
home growing to be able to take in for
 
06:06:09.590 --> 06:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
testing if they wish to do so so there
 
06:06:12.288 --> 06:06:12.298 align:start position:0%
is that tremendous Safeguard and so they
 
06:06:13.548 --> 06:06:13.558 align:start position:0%
look at their plan they go well I wonder
 
06:06:15.350 --> 06:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
if that's really okay they can go check
 
06:06:18.590 --> 06:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
it also I would assume that the atcs
 
06:06:19.850 --> 06:06:19.860 align:start position:0%
will get involved in some decent
 
06:06:22.850 --> 06:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
counseling about how to safely grow so
 
06:06:25.310 --> 06:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
people aren't growing in lead-filled
 
06:06:27.530 --> 06:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
soil with a bunch of pesticides that
 
06:06:31.010 --> 06:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
they're then going to combust and inhale
 
06:06:32.868 --> 06:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
06:06:34.548 --> 06:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
06:06:37.070 --> 06:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
honorable Dr knurk for being here today
 
06:06:40.250 --> 06:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
my question comes to the idea that um
 
06:06:41.510 --> 06:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
one of the cult the one of the people
 
06:06:43.430 --> 06:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
who's a caregiver would currently be
 
06:06:45.830 --> 06:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
limited to just one patient and I'm just
 
06:06:47.690 --> 06:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
curious about says curious about the
 
06:06:49.970 --> 06:06:49.980 align:start position:0%
situations where you may have say two
 
06:06:52.788 --> 06:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
patients in a household and if that
 
06:06:54.110 --> 06:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
would be something that would be
 
06:06:56.150 --> 06:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable within your experience if
 
06:06:58.910 --> 06:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
we'd be able to expand it to a certain
 
06:07:00.590 --> 06:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
number of people in a household and not
 
06:07:03.708 --> 06:07:03.718 align:start position:0%
just one individual or a caregiver yes I
 
06:07:05.930 --> 06:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
think that could be a little bit of an
 
06:07:07.430 --> 06:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
uncertainty in other words if you do
 
06:07:08.810 --> 06:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
have let's say two people in the
 
06:07:10.850 --> 06:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
household do they each qualify for the
 
06:07:13.368 --> 06:07:13.378 align:start position:0%
same to each by themselves have a
 
06:07:14.690 --> 06:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
certain number of plants so the number
 
06:07:16.368 --> 06:07:16.378 align:start position:0%
in the household would be more than the
 
06:07:18.350 --> 06:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
qualified amount but they would each be
 
06:07:20.750 --> 06:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for one half of that I don't
 
06:07:23.448 --> 06:07:23.458 align:start position:0%
see why that couldn't work uh that I
 
06:07:24.948 --> 06:07:24.958 align:start position:0%
would think that it would be okay they
 
06:07:27.470 --> 06:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
just happen to be residing together
 
06:07:28.788 --> 06:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:07:31.670 --> 06:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:33.770 --> 06:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions
 
06:07:37.910 --> 06:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:48.830 --> 06:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:53.208 --> 06:07:53.218 align:start position:0%
hello again uh johannan uh like I said I
 
06:07:54.708 --> 06:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
was on the marijuana study commission
 
06:07:56.090 --> 06:07:56.100 align:start position:0%
years ago and one of the things that we
 
06:07:58.368 --> 06:07:58.378 align:start position:0%
did talk about was home grow in general
 
06:08:01.730 --> 06:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
for adult use not just medical and that
 
06:08:04.490 --> 06:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
was the issue of that commission uh it
 
06:08:05.990 --> 06:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to be a very uh
 
06:08:07.250 --> 06:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
controversial issue there were some
 
06:08:08.448 --> 06:08:08.458 align:start position:0%
members of the commission who obviously
 
06:08:10.190 --> 06:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
didn't agree with it or legalization in
 
06:08:10.200 --> 06:08:11.030 align:start position:0%
didn't agree with it or legalization in
general

06:08:11.030 --> 06:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
general
 
06:08:14.330 --> 06:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
at all but uh a vast majority of the
 
06:08:15.890 --> 06:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
people in the commission realize that
 
06:08:18.770 --> 06:08:18.780 align:start position:0%
homegrow was akin to home brew of beer
 
06:08:21.530 --> 06:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
and wine you know we're allowed to brew
 
06:08:24.110 --> 06:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
you can grow you can have 100 gallons of
 
06:08:25.970 --> 06:08:25.980 align:start position:0%
beer or wine if you have two adults in
 
06:08:27.350 --> 06:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
the house you can have 200 gallons a
 
06:08:30.110 --> 06:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
year that's a good amount
 
06:08:32.830 --> 06:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
um and in this bill it does talk about
 
06:08:35.750 --> 06:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
more than one certified provider for a
 
06:08:37.190 --> 06:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis patient or two cannabis
 
06:08:38.390 --> 06:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
patients living at home you can have if
 
06:08:39.830 --> 06:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
you have one provider and a patient you
 
06:08:43.610 --> 06:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
can have 50 square feet of canopy and if
 
06:08:46.610 --> 06:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
you have two either providers or
 
06:08:48.590 --> 06:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
patients in the same in the household
 
06:08:50.570 --> 06:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
you can have up to 100 foot canopy so
 
06:08:52.910 --> 06:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
that is in the bill already
 
06:08:52.920 --> 06:08:53.930 align:start position:0%
that is in the bill already
um

06:08:53.930 --> 06:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:56.930 --> 06:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
and as far as protections
 
06:08:59.090 --> 06:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
um the the home home brew law is really
 
06:09:01.368 --> 06:09:01.378 align:start position:0%
simple I'm sure I don't know if well I
 
06:09:02.208 --> 06:09:02.218 align:start position:0%
don't know if you read it much in this
 
06:09:03.288 --> 06:09:03.298 align:start position:0%
community I was on Commerce we had to
 
06:09:05.330 --> 06:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
read it all the time but um
 
06:09:07.430 --> 06:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's real short it's a couple paragraphs
 
06:09:09.948 --> 06:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
and it just says you know you it's for
 
06:09:11.510 --> 06:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
personal use is really what it's you can
 
06:09:13.430 --> 06:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
grow this much for this much it's for
 
06:09:15.650 --> 06:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
personal use there were no requirements
 
06:09:18.470 --> 06:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
for uh you know locked doors or keeping
 
06:09:20.090 --> 06:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
it from public view although it's
 
06:09:21.230 --> 06:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
probably a good idea with some of my
 
06:09:22.730 --> 06:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
neighbors they're very nice but I
 
06:09:23.930 --> 06:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
wouldn't leave it still out in the yard
 
06:09:26.750 --> 06:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
or whatever but um you know as this bill
 
06:09:28.910 --> 06:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
does have uh
 
06:09:30.948 --> 06:09:30.958 align:start position:0%
parts that talk about you know not being
 
06:09:33.708 --> 06:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
able to be seen from public view uh one
 
06:09:34.788 --> 06:09:34.798 align:start position:0%
thing I'm not really sure is necessarily
 
06:09:36.410 --> 06:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
with or without the use of optical AIDS
 
06:09:38.208 --> 06:09:38.218 align:start position:0%
if someone's using a telescope to look
 
06:09:39.770 --> 06:09:39.780 align:start position:0%
into my yard that's a little intrusive
 
06:09:41.570 --> 06:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
so I think it'd just be from Plain View
 
06:09:43.850 --> 06:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
would be a nice change
 
06:09:45.650 --> 06:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
um and really that's about it it's a
 
06:09:46.970 --> 06:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward Bill and
 
06:09:48.770 --> 06:09:48.780 align:start position:0%
otherwise um if I could make my own
 
06:09:50.570 --> 06:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
medicines at home I'm sure I would for
 
06:09:52.310 --> 06:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
most things I've actually gone to the
 
06:09:54.170 --> 06:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
pharmacy several times in the last month
 
06:09:56.448 --> 06:09:56.458 align:start position:0%
for my family my children and I myself
 
06:09:58.128 --> 06:09:58.138 align:start position:0%
and there are three different
 
06:09:59.690 --> 06:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
medications in my family that we have
 
06:10:01.190 --> 06:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
not been able to get a hold of not that
 
06:10:02.510 --> 06:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
there's a shortage of cannabis right now
 
06:10:04.850 --> 06:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
but if you can't get a medication I
 
06:10:05.868 --> 06:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
would have loved to have been able to
 
06:10:08.150 --> 06:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
grow you know blood pressure pills or
 
06:10:10.970 --> 06:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
whatever it is at home so
 
06:10:14.810 --> 06:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
um thank you questions
 
06:10:20.570 --> 06:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:23.810 --> 06:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is a Matt Simon
 
06:10:33.650 --> 06:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:35.208 --> 06:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
in three minutes sir
 
06:10:37.070 --> 06:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman honorable
 
06:10:39.410 --> 06:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
committee great to see you again
 
06:10:41.690 --> 06:10:41.700 align:start position:0%
I don't have written testimony instead
 
06:10:43.548 --> 06:10:43.558 align:start position:0%
I'm going to refer to two one-page
 
06:10:45.110 --> 06:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
documents that representative Thomas
 
06:10:47.650 --> 06:10:47.660 align:start position:0%
presented with the package she gave you
 
06:10:51.110 --> 06:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
earlier one of them is home cultivation
 
06:10:53.628 --> 06:10:53.638 align:start position:0%
legislative history one is cannabis
 
06:10:56.208 --> 06:10:56.218 align:start position:0%
cultivation laws in New England I
 
06:10:57.948 --> 06:10:57.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned these because before I work
 
06:11:00.830 --> 06:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
for primeatc I've been for the last 15
 
06:11:02.930 --> 06:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
years advocating for
 
06:11:04.850 --> 06:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
cannabis policy reform in New Hampshire
 
06:11:07.670 --> 06:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
and in particular legal home cultivation
 
06:11:11.390 --> 06:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
for both patients and for adults prior
 
06:11:14.628 --> 06:11:14.638 align:start position:0%
to working for Prime ATC a job I took
 
06:11:16.730 --> 06:11:16.740 align:start position:0%
about a year and a half ago I worked for
 
06:11:18.350 --> 06:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
the national marijuana policy project
 
06:11:21.590 --> 06:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
for 10 years in that role I advocated
 
06:11:24.610 --> 06:11:24.620 align:start position:0%
for this therapeutic cannabis law in
 
06:11:27.288 --> 06:11:27.298 align:start position:0%
2013 back when representative McKay was
 
06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and spent a lot of time with
 
06:11:32.810 --> 06:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
this committee back then and even before
 
06:11:34.850 --> 06:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
that in 2007 was when I started
 
06:11:36.288 --> 06:11:36.298 align:start position:0%
advocating for this stuff in New
 
06:11:39.530 --> 06:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I really sincerely hope and
 
06:11:41.750 --> 06:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
cautiously optimistically perhaps
 
06:11:44.810 --> 06:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
believe that this will be the 15th and
 
06:11:47.448 --> 06:11:47.458 align:start position:0%
final year that we all have to come in
 
06:11:50.090 --> 06:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
here and ask this committee to do what
 
06:11:51.770 --> 06:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
it is in fact done many times in the
 
06:11:54.230 --> 06:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
past to prove limited home cultivation
 
06:11:57.110 --> 06:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
of therapeutic cannabis so I'm not going
 
06:11:58.788 --> 06:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
to go through all this but this is the
 
06:12:00.770 --> 06:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
document I created five years ago and
 
06:12:02.570 --> 06:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
I've updated each year as for their
 
06:12:04.190 --> 06:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
development moments have happened now it
 
06:12:06.368 --> 06:12:06.378 align:start position:0%
takes two pages to tell the whole story
 
06:12:09.048 --> 06:12:09.058 align:start position:0%
but I'm really hopeful this is the last
 
06:12:12.350 --> 06:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
entry that HTTP 431 will be the bill
 
06:12:15.110 --> 06:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
that that passes into law and you can
 
06:12:17.830 --> 06:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
see just how close patients have come
 
06:12:21.048 --> 06:12:21.058 align:start position:0%
two votes in 2009 were the difference
 
06:12:23.448 --> 06:12:23.458 align:start position:0%
between this passing and not and
 
06:12:25.570 --> 06:12:25.580 align:start position:0%
including home cultivation
 
06:12:30.170 --> 06:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
again in 2000 multiple times it's been
 
06:12:31.970 --> 06:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
within three votes in 2019 it was a
 
06:12:34.910 --> 06:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
three vote veto override that the house
 
06:12:36.410 --> 06:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
override The veto and the Senate didn't
 
06:12:36.420 --> 06:12:38.330 align:start position:0%
override The veto and the Senate didn't
so

06:12:38.330 --> 06:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:12:40.490 --> 06:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
the other document is just laws in New
 
06:12:42.230 --> 06:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
England I made this a few years ago when
 
06:12:44.750 --> 06:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
it wasn't complete but I'm I had fun
 
06:12:46.970 --> 06:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
updating it last week and now showing
 
06:12:49.850 --> 06:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
that every state in New England cannabis
 
06:12:52.548 --> 06:12:52.558 align:start position:0%
is now legal not only for medical use
 
06:12:55.490 --> 06:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
but for adult use and patients and
 
06:12:57.770 --> 06:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
adults in every state are allowed to
 
06:12:59.750 --> 06:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
grow cannabis for their own
 
06:13:02.628 --> 06:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
limited use so the Live Free or Die
 
06:13:04.430 --> 06:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
state is yes the only state in New
 
06:13:06.708 --> 06:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
England where it is a crime to grow
 
06:13:09.708 --> 06:13:09.718 align:start position:0%
small amounts of cannabis for registered
 
06:13:12.770 --> 06:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
patients and for adults Connecticut's
 
06:13:13.910 --> 06:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
the only one that hasn't taken effect
 
06:13:16.490 --> 06:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
yet for adults patients can grow there
 
06:13:19.250 --> 06:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
and they've passed it for adults so July
 
06:13:21.310 --> 06:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
1st of this year
 
06:13:23.750 --> 06:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
that will take effect and we will be
 
06:13:26.330 --> 06:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
truly an island of
 
06:13:29.030 --> 06:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
home cultivation Prohibition in New
 
06:13:29.040 --> 06:13:29.990 align:start position:0%
home cultivation Prohibition in New
England

06:13:29.990 --> 06:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
England
 
06:13:32.270 --> 06:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
so I'll leave those
 
06:13:36.410 --> 06:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
aside I do want to note briefly
 
06:13:39.048 --> 06:13:39.058 align:start position:0%
on the affirmative defense provision
 
06:13:41.930 --> 06:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
that represented a former rep Connor uh
 
06:13:44.030 --> 06:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned so the bill does two things
 
06:13:46.190 --> 06:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
one one is that it adds
 
06:13:48.470 --> 06:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
possession of plants to what's legal for
 
06:13:50.448 --> 06:13:50.458 align:start position:0%
patients the second part is an
 
06:13:54.470 --> 06:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
affirmative defense so this doesn't in
 
06:13:57.530 --> 06:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
my view create chaos this means that if
 
06:14:00.830 --> 06:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
somebody happens to be arrested and
 
06:14:02.330 --> 06:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
could be charged with a crime for
 
06:14:04.548 --> 06:14:04.558 align:start position:0%
possessing a few plants before they
 
06:14:06.530 --> 06:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
receive their card that they would have
 
06:14:07.970 --> 06:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
an affirmative defense that they could
 
06:14:09.770 --> 06:14:09.780 align:start position:0%
take into court they could still be
 
06:14:12.110 --> 06:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
arrested they could still be charged but
 
06:14:13.548 --> 06:14:13.558 align:start position:0%
their attorney could walk into court and
 
06:14:16.610 --> 06:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
say hey my client has a card now it just
 
06:14:18.350 --> 06:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
arrived in the mail yesterday and do we
 
06:14:20.030 --> 06:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
really want this person to face felony
 
06:14:22.310 --> 06:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
penalties which is what the penalty is
 
06:14:24.708 --> 06:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
for home cultivation so it's not
 
06:14:27.170 --> 06:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
wrapping up sir absolutely I haven't
 
06:14:29.090 --> 06:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
even gotten to my employer Prime ATC
 
06:14:31.368 --> 06:14:31.378 align:start position:0%
supports this I would not work for any
 
06:14:33.590 --> 06:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis business that opposed home
 
06:14:33.600 --> 06:14:34.930 align:start position:0%
cannabis business that opposed home
cultivation

06:14:34.930 --> 06:14:34.940 align:start position:0%
cultivation
 
06:14:37.368 --> 06:14:37.378 align:start position:0%
we understand it's not a bottom line
 
06:14:39.530 --> 06:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
issue for us at all as as representative
 
06:14:42.048 --> 06:14:42.058 align:start position:0%
Nagel mentioned we are non-profits in
 
06:14:43.730 --> 06:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire our mission is to serve
 
06:14:45.590 --> 06:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
patients and
 
06:14:48.470 --> 06:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
I have never been able to understand any
 
06:14:50.510 --> 06:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
argument that says exposing patients to
 
06:14:52.670 --> 06:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
felony penalties is in any way
 
06:14:54.410 --> 06:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
beneficial for their health and
 
06:14:57.470 --> 06:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
well-being so most patients won't want
 
06:14:59.750 --> 06:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
to grow their own for those that do our
 
06:15:02.030 --> 06:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
staff members are excited about the
 
06:15:03.708 --> 06:15:03.718 align:start position:0%
possibility of being able to help
 
06:15:06.948 --> 06:15:06.958 align:start position:0%
educate and provide support in any way
 
06:15:09.530 --> 06:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
that we can if that's you know selling
 
06:15:11.750 --> 06:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
seedlings or whatever we're totally open
 
06:15:14.270 --> 06:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
to that we want to help our patients uh
 
06:15:17.150 --> 06:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
live their best lives so have you take
 
06:15:18.708 --> 06:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you for considering
 
06:15:21.470 --> 06:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
my testimony representative McLean
 
06:15:23.090 --> 06:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:15:26.390 --> 06:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony uh Mr Simon one of
 
06:15:27.948 --> 06:15:27.958 align:start position:0%
one of the things you mentioned in your
 
06:15:29.868 --> 06:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
testimony was some of the history and
 
06:15:31.970 --> 06:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
some of the barriers to passage in the
 
06:15:31.980 --> 06:15:33.048 align:start position:0%
some of the barriers to passage in the
past

06:15:33.048 --> 06:15:33.058 align:start position:0%
past
 
06:15:35.390 --> 06:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
um I I've noticed today with with all of
 
06:15:37.490 --> 06:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
these bills I haven't really seen a lot
 
06:15:40.310 --> 06:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement presence
 
06:15:42.830 --> 06:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
um as part of these discussions and
 
06:15:45.170 --> 06:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
maybe uh you know former representative
 
06:15:48.410 --> 06:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
could could give input as well
 
06:15:51.048 --> 06:15:51.058 align:start position:0%
what has been the feedback from the law
 
06:15:53.330 --> 06:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
enforcement Community with respect to
 
06:15:55.788 --> 06:15:55.798 align:start position:0%
this legislation has they been consulted
 
06:15:57.230 --> 06:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
they've given you any feedback at all
 
06:15:58.730 --> 06:15:58.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:16:02.030 --> 06:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative so over 15 years I've had
 
06:16:03.948 --> 06:16:03.958 align:start position:0%
many meetings and conversations with
 
06:16:06.590 --> 06:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
various members of law enforcement I
 
06:16:08.810 --> 06:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
would not paint the law enforcement
 
06:16:10.670 --> 06:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
Community with a broad brush and say
 
06:16:12.948 --> 06:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
that law enforcement thinks this or law
 
06:16:14.750 --> 06:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement thinks that because I think
 
06:16:14.760 --> 06:16:15.650 align:start position:0%
enforcement thinks that because I think
they're

06:16:15.650 --> 06:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
they're
 
06:16:17.628 --> 06:16:17.638 align:start position:0%
hundreds thousands probably of law
 
06:16:19.610 --> 06:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh professionals who have
 
06:16:21.830 --> 06:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
their own opinions I will say the New
 
06:16:24.110 --> 06:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Chiefs of Police Association
 
06:16:27.110 --> 06:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
in particular has weighed in very
 
06:16:29.930 --> 06:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
strongly on this bill and on this issue
 
06:16:32.270 --> 06:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
all along they posed therapeutic
 
06:16:35.570 --> 06:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh no matter how it was written
 
06:16:37.850 --> 06:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
no matter how restrictive it was even if
 
06:16:39.770 --> 06:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
it was only for cancer even if it was
 
06:16:41.570 --> 06:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
only going to help one patient they were
 
06:16:43.548 --> 06:16:43.558 align:start position:0%
absolutely opposed to passing this law
 
06:16:47.750 --> 06:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
in 2009 and 2013 they've been absolutely
 
06:16:50.270 --> 06:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to decrim for that matter to any
 
06:16:52.250 --> 06:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
form of legalization to any form of
 
06:16:55.208 --> 06:16:55.218 align:start position:0%
cultivation they've been reliably
 
06:16:58.310 --> 06:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
vigorously opposed and unwilling to
 
06:17:00.770 --> 06:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
negotiate I remember in a two-hour
 
06:17:03.170 --> 06:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
meeting at a certain police chief's
 
06:17:05.690 --> 06:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
office with their lobbyist and and a
 
06:17:08.570 --> 06:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
state senator trying because the Senate
 
06:17:10.310 --> 06:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
asked us to negotiate well we all sat
 
06:17:12.288 --> 06:17:12.298 align:start position:0%
down for two hours they were not willing
 
06:17:14.570 --> 06:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
to negotiate there was no version of
 
06:17:16.430 --> 06:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
this that they were ever going to be
 
06:17:18.470 --> 06:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable with and for that reason the
 
06:17:21.110 --> 06:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
legislature ultimately decided Well
 
06:17:22.690 --> 06:17:22.700 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it anyway
 
06:17:25.010 --> 06:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
I've also heard the state police major
 
06:17:27.048 --> 06:17:27.058 align:start position:0%
testify publicly that there have been no
 
06:17:29.690 --> 06:17:29.700 align:start position:0%
problems associated with this law in the
 
06:17:32.510 --> 06:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
years that it's it's been implemented so
 
06:17:34.548 --> 06:17:34.558 align:start position:0%
the chiefs of police very opposed I
 
06:17:36.708 --> 06:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
think a silent majority of law
 
06:17:38.570 --> 06:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
enforcement professionals probably do
 
06:17:40.250 --> 06:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
not have any issue with this and do not
 
06:17:43.910 --> 06:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
want to bust people for a few plants
 
06:17:47.750 --> 06:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:49.490 --> 06:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
yes yeah could I just make a public
 
06:17:52.930 --> 06:17:52.940 align:start position:0%
comment about so you about the you said
 
06:17:55.788 --> 06:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
any police officer there was one
 
06:17:57.708 --> 06:17:57.718 align:start position:0%
actually in here previously he had to
 
06:18:00.770 --> 06:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
leave I noticed because we are quite
 
06:18:02.090 --> 06:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
over time
 
06:18:03.830 --> 06:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
um with when this was supposed to go up
 
06:18:06.048 --> 06:18:06.058 align:start position:0%
but he was I know the only reason I know
 
06:18:07.490 --> 06:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
that is because I've known him since he
 
06:18:09.830 --> 06:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
was a teenager when we walked in so he
 
06:18:12.110 --> 06:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
is a high-level police officer so there
 
06:18:13.788 --> 06:18:13.798 align:start position:0%
was someone here but he did have to
 
06:18:16.610 --> 06:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
leave because of time
 
06:18:18.470 --> 06:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
06:18:19.910 --> 06:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
06:18:21.948 --> 06:18:21.958 align:start position:0%
Mr Simon for being here and the
 
06:18:23.270 --> 06:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge you bring
 
06:18:25.070 --> 06:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
um my question is going back to the
 
06:18:26.868 --> 06:18:26.878 align:start position:0%
definitions of seedlings and immature
 
06:18:26.878 --> 06:18:28.128 align:start position:0%
definitions of seedlings and immature
plants

06:18:28.128 --> 06:18:28.138 align:start position:0%
plants
 
06:18:29.868 --> 06:18:29.878 align:start position:0%
um I don't see any definition of
 
06:18:32.090 --> 06:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
immature plant although as somebody
 
06:18:34.850 --> 06:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
married to a gardener it it's obvious
 
06:18:36.830 --> 06:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
when it actually comes to gardening when
 
06:18:38.930 --> 06:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
it mature and immature is and I didn't
 
06:18:41.270 --> 06:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
know if that would be a point of
 
06:18:44.330 --> 06:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
confusion for anybody so I'm just
 
06:18:46.070 --> 06:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
curious as to whether we would need to
 
06:18:48.590 --> 06:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
look for a definition of immature plant
 
06:18:51.410 --> 06:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
now that that classification is added
 
06:18:52.730 --> 06:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:18:55.190 --> 06:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative so I'm looking at the
 
06:18:57.590 --> 06:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill I'm on the first page
 
06:19:01.190 --> 06:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at line 24
 
06:19:03.650 --> 06:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
and I see a definition that appears to
 
06:19:05.330 --> 06:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
be a definition of immature cannabis
 
06:19:06.890 --> 06:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
plan it says immature cannabis plant
 
06:19:09.230 --> 06:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
means a cannabis plant that is not
 
06:19:11.690 --> 06:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
flowered and which does not have buds
 
06:19:13.010 --> 06:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
that may be observed by visual
 
06:19:15.048 --> 06:19:15.058 align:start position:0%
examination and which is at least six
 
06:19:16.430 --> 06:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
inches tall
 
06:19:18.410 --> 06:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
the next line is the definition of
 
06:19:20.628 --> 06:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
mature plant that's a female cannabis
 
06:19:22.788 --> 06:19:22.798 align:start position:0%
plant that's flowered and that has buds
 
06:19:24.890 --> 06:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
that may be observed by visual
 
06:19:26.810 --> 06:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
examination so now that I'm reading this
 
06:19:28.310 --> 06:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
I'm remembering like five years ago when
 
06:19:29.930 --> 06:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
we worked out these definitions and they
 
06:19:31.970 --> 06:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
made sense to me then they still do does
 
06:19:33.470 --> 06:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
that make sense to you you're right I
 
06:19:37.430 --> 06:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:42.708 --> 06:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:44.810 --> 06:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
saying no other questions thank you
 
06:19:48.948 --> 06:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:50.810 --> 06:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
I also signed up to speak is Michael
 
06:19:52.190 --> 06:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
Holt from the Department of Health and
 
06:20:00.830 --> 06:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:03.288 --> 06:20:03.298 align:start position:0%
hello again thank you Mr chair my name
 
06:20:04.730 --> 06:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
is Michael Holt I'm the administrator of
 
06:20:08.208 --> 06:20:08.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:11.030 --> 06:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
um my major point of testimony is that
 
06:20:13.610 --> 06:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
uh this uh the amendment that was
 
06:20:15.948 --> 06:20:15.958 align:start position:0%
circulated by uh the sponsor Wendy
 
06:20:18.890 --> 06:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
Thomas is a is is a needed Amendment
 
06:20:21.470 --> 06:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
um the amendment passed out needs
 
06:20:23.090 --> 06:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
further work
 
06:20:25.310 --> 06:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
um and I am eager to work with the
 
06:20:26.930 --> 06:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
sponsor in the committee to make that
 
06:20:26.940 --> 06:20:27.890 align:start position:0%
sponsor in the committee to make that
Amendment

06:20:27.890 --> 06:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
06:20:30.048 --> 06:20:30.058 align:start position:0%
um accurate um so that it addresses the
 
06:20:31.970 --> 06:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
issues in the in the bill
 
06:20:33.530 --> 06:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
um itself
 
06:20:36.288 --> 06:20:36.298 align:start position:0%
um the the committee has has asked very
 
06:20:38.448 --> 06:20:38.458 align:start position:0%
excellent questions about this bill
 
06:20:40.850 --> 06:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
um this bill has been has been around
 
06:20:43.310 --> 06:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
the block for years
 
06:20:46.190 --> 06:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
um we have uh we have worked with the
 
06:20:48.170 --> 06:20:48.180 align:start position:0%
sponsors in years past
 
06:20:50.810 --> 06:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
um to identify obstacles for
 
06:20:53.750 --> 06:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
implementation there are none for the
 
06:20:55.310 --> 06:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
Department to implement this uh this
 
06:20:55.320 --> 06:20:56.030 align:start position:0%
Department to implement this uh this
bill

06:20:56.030 --> 06:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:20:57.230 --> 06:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
um some of the highlights and the and
 
06:20:58.670 --> 06:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
the and the
 
06:21:00.770 --> 06:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
and the precautions built into this bill
 
06:21:02.448 --> 06:21:02.458 align:start position:0%
I just like to highlight
 
06:21:02.458 --> 06:21:03.048 align:start position:0%
I just like to highlight
um

06:21:03.048 --> 06:21:03.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:06.350 --> 06:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
this bill allows either the patient or
 
06:21:09.170 --> 06:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
their caregiver to cultivate not both
 
06:21:12.350 --> 06:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
if the caregiver cultivates that means
 
06:21:14.330 --> 06:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
that that caregiver can only serve one
 
06:21:17.330 --> 06:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
patient and not the normal five it is
 
06:21:20.208 --> 06:21:20.218 align:start position:0%
true that the majority of patient
 
06:21:22.250 --> 06:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
caregiver relationships are one to one
 
06:21:24.350 --> 06:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
and there we do we have very few uh
 
06:21:26.030 --> 06:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
caregivers that serve multiple patients
 
06:21:29.030 --> 06:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
but this limits uh that caregiver to
 
06:21:30.830 --> 06:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
only having one patient if they're
 
06:21:30.840 --> 06:21:32.510 align:start position:0%
only having one patient if they're
cultivating

06:21:32.510 --> 06:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
cultivating
 
06:21:35.330 --> 06:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
um the uh whoever cultivates must report
 
06:21:38.208 --> 06:21:38.218 align:start position:0%
the cultivation location to the
 
06:21:39.230 --> 06:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
06:21:41.628 --> 06:21:41.638 align:start position:0%
so that it's in in the record one of the
 
06:21:43.548 --> 06:21:43.558 align:start position:0%
things that the amendment does that is
 
06:21:43.558 --> 06:21:44.690 align:start position:0%
things that the amendment does that is
critical

06:21:44.690 --> 06:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
critical
 
06:21:46.670 --> 06:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
um for a security and Public Safety
 
06:21:48.110 --> 06:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
standpoint is to require that
 
06:21:50.090 --> 06:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
cultivation location to be at the
 
06:21:52.490 --> 06:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
individual's residence so that it is not
 
06:21:55.128 --> 06:21:55.138 align:start position:0%
in a factory warehouse down the road
 
06:21:57.770 --> 06:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
um it is it is a location reported
 
06:21:59.690 --> 06:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
um and it must be at the at the
 
06:21:59.700 --> 06:22:01.730 align:start position:0%
um and it must be at the at the
residence

06:22:01.730 --> 06:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
residence
 
06:22:04.010 --> 06:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
um currently under under current law the
 
06:22:06.708 --> 06:22:06.718 align:start position:0%
one testing laboratory in the state can
 
06:22:08.868 --> 06:22:08.878 align:start position:0%
only accept cannabis samples from the
 
06:22:11.510 --> 06:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
atcs this bill has a provision that
 
06:22:14.090 --> 06:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
allows that one laboratory or any future
 
06:22:17.208 --> 06:22:17.218 align:start position:0%
Laboratories to accept samples from the
 
06:22:19.788 --> 06:22:19.798 align:start position:0%
public uh the public being a therapeutic
 
06:22:21.590 --> 06:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis patient or their caregiver um
 
06:22:23.690 --> 06:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
to bring in samples to have that tested
 
06:22:25.910 --> 06:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
certainly doesn't address the issue of
 
06:22:28.548 --> 06:22:28.558 align:start position:0%
you know a patient using you know uh
 
06:22:30.470 --> 06:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
pesticides that are bad for them to
 
06:22:32.690 --> 06:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
inhale perhaps but it does allow for the
 
06:22:35.570 --> 06:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to have that tested for
 
06:22:35.580 --> 06:22:36.708 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to have that tested for
contaminants

06:22:36.708 --> 06:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
contaminants
 
06:22:38.330 --> 06:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
um and the cannabinoid profile to
 
06:22:41.390 --> 06:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
identify the potency of the product
 
06:22:43.368 --> 06:22:43.378 align:start position:0%
um another critical provision is that it
 
06:22:46.730 --> 06:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
does allow for a source of of ceilings
 
06:22:51.048 --> 06:22:51.058 align:start position:0%
the atcs are permitted to uh sell a
 
06:22:53.330 --> 06:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
limited number of seedlings uh to their
 
06:22:53.340 --> 06:22:54.708 align:start position:0%
limited number of seedlings uh to their
patients

06:22:54.708 --> 06:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
patients
 
06:22:56.390 --> 06:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
um uh within a within a certain time
 
06:22:58.310 --> 06:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
period that's consistent with the the
 
06:22:59.810 --> 06:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
plant limitations and the seedling
 
06:23:02.868 --> 06:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
limitations uh in in the law as as was
 
06:23:05.628 --> 06:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
stated seeds are legal uh federally so
 
06:23:07.610 --> 06:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
people could grow their own but that
 
06:23:10.970 --> 06:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
allowance that allows the atcs to engage
 
06:23:13.750 --> 06:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
in this process with their patients
 
06:23:17.570 --> 06:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
allows the education you know that to
 
06:23:19.548 --> 06:23:19.558 align:start position:0%
happen based on that that developed
 
06:23:19.558 --> 06:23:21.470 align:start position:0%
happen based on that that developed
relationship

06:23:21.470 --> 06:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
06:23:21.480 --> 06:23:24.430 align:start position:0%
relationship
um

06:23:24.430 --> 06:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:27.590 --> 06:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
and yes again to be to be clear about uh
 
06:23:29.510 --> 06:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
the the the grow whether indoor or
 
06:23:31.670 --> 06:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
outdoor uh the bill does not say does
 
06:23:34.128 --> 06:23:34.138 align:start position:0%
not restrict indoor or outdoor grows it
 
06:23:37.250 --> 06:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
is presumed to allow outdoor grows uh
 
06:23:38.930 --> 06:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
and uh but it does require them to be
 
06:23:43.310 --> 06:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
enclosed locked and later on on page two
 
06:23:46.310 --> 06:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
um the um it requires them to be out of
 
06:23:47.990 --> 06:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
public view so these are standard
 
06:23:49.490 --> 06:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
precautions and other uh home
 
06:23:51.830 --> 06:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
cultivation States
 
06:23:54.530 --> 06:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
um but again to to conclude I would say
 
06:23:56.030 --> 06:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
that um
 
06:23:58.190 --> 06:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
the an amendment is is important for
 
06:24:00.590 --> 06:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'm eager to work with uh
 
06:24:01.970 --> 06:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
representatives in the committee to to
 
06:24:04.128 --> 06:24:04.138 align:start position:0%
nail that nail that down representative
 
06:24:04.138 --> 06:24:05.690 align:start position:0%
nail that nail that down representative
Weber

06:24:05.690 --> 06:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
06:24:07.610 --> 06:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time we've normally
 
06:24:09.708 --> 06:24:09.718 align:start position:0%
gone through the Amendments needed but
 
06:24:11.208 --> 06:24:11.218 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time would you be
 
06:24:12.890 --> 06:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
willing to email to the committee
 
06:24:15.110 --> 06:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
members who will not discuss as a whole
 
06:24:18.230 --> 06:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh because that would violate 91a but
 
06:24:21.770 --> 06:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
could you email each of us your specific
 
06:24:25.010 --> 06:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill as amended by
 
06:24:27.530 --> 06:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas's Amendment yes I
 
06:24:29.510 --> 06:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
can and will thank you very much welcome
 
06:24:32.330 --> 06:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative McKay thank you Mr
 
06:24:32.340 --> 06:24:34.150 align:start position:0%
representative McKay thank you Mr
chairman

06:24:34.150 --> 06:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:24:38.590 --> 06:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
over the five years that I was chairman
 
06:24:45.368 --> 06:24:45.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:48.770 --> 06:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
and I feel a bit of emotional but
 
06:24:52.070 --> 06:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
surprises me the the one person that
 
06:24:54.708 --> 06:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
held me together and I think the
 
06:24:57.770 --> 06:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
commission which was not always easy was
 
06:24:59.110 --> 06:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
Michael hope
 
06:25:02.570 --> 06:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
And he as you can see today is a
 
06:25:05.930 --> 06:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
reasonable human being and in a very
 
06:25:05.940 --> 06:25:07.490 align:start position:0%
reasonable human being and in a very

position
 
06:25:12.590 --> 06:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
so that it's kind of nice that after all
 
06:25:14.750 --> 06:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
these years we can say something
 
06:25:18.410 --> 06:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
positive about this person in the
 
06:25:21.288 --> 06:25:21.298 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
06:25:25.850 --> 06:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
who desires a great deal of recognition
 
06:25:29.150 --> 06:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
and support for his great work thank you
 
06:25:30.110 --> 06:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
very much
 
06:25:31.910 --> 06:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
well thank you sir
 
06:25:34.970 --> 06:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:40.330 --> 06:25:40.340 align:start position:0%

06:25:54.708 --> 06:25:54.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Heather Marie Brown
 
06:25:57.048 --> 06:25:57.058 align:start position:0%
patient rep therapeutic cannabis medical
 
06:25:59.810 --> 06:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
oversight board I'm not quite sure if
 
06:26:01.910 --> 06:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative knurk mentioned it I
 
06:26:03.770 --> 06:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
didn't hear him but it could just be the
 
06:26:06.230 --> 06:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
Acoustics but I do want to tell you that
 
06:26:09.190 --> 06:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
the medical oversight board did vote
 
06:26:12.948 --> 06:26:12.958 align:start position:0%
unanimously to support patient home grow
 
06:26:15.410 --> 06:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
which is a huge accomplishment and I'm
 
06:26:17.930 --> 06:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
very excited about that so I'm glad to
 
06:26:20.330 --> 06:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
be able to tell you all that I'm just
 
06:26:22.548 --> 06:26:22.558 align:start position:0%
going to give you a little example my
 
06:26:24.530 --> 06:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
income is eighteen thousand dollars a
 
06:26:24.540 --> 06:26:25.310 align:start position:0%
income is eighteen thousand dollars a
year

06:26:25.310 --> 06:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
06:26:28.010 --> 06:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
I can barely survive as it is take care
 
06:26:30.410 --> 06:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
of my children pay rent electricity
 
06:26:32.750 --> 06:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
especially with the way that electricity
 
06:26:36.230 --> 06:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
rates are now heating fuel food you name
 
06:26:39.530 --> 06:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
it all right I'm very limited on that
 
06:26:42.530 --> 06:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
um if I were to purchase the Cannabis
 
06:26:46.730 --> 06:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
that I use throughout a month from a
 
06:26:49.010 --> 06:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment center I am
 
06:26:51.350 --> 06:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
looking at spending approximately ten
 
06:26:53.628 --> 06:26:53.638 align:start position:0%
thousand eight hundred dollars a year
 
06:26:56.090 --> 06:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
now my income is eighteen thousand
 
06:27:00.288 --> 06:27:00.298 align:start position:0%
dollars so guess what I'm not doing I am
 
06:27:03.350 --> 06:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
not getting all of the Cannabis that I
 
06:27:04.970 --> 06:27:04.980 align:start position:0%
need from the alternative treatment
 
06:27:04.980 --> 06:27:07.208 align:start position:0%
need from the alternative treatment
centers

06:27:07.208 --> 06:27:07.218 align:start position:0%
centers
 
06:27:10.250 --> 06:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I am not the only patient
 
06:27:12.470 --> 06:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
in that situation we have many patients
 
06:27:14.810 --> 06:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
that are in that situation they are
 
06:27:18.410 --> 06:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
forced to do one of three things either
 
06:27:21.190 --> 06:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
live and suffer
 
06:27:23.570 --> 06:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
acquire their cannabis from a
 
06:27:27.770 --> 06:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
unregulated black market it or risk
 
06:27:30.110 --> 06:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
their safety and their health by
 
06:27:32.810 --> 06:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
traveling over state borders to other
 
06:27:36.288 --> 06:27:36.298 align:start position:0%
states in spending their money in those
 
06:27:38.628 --> 06:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
States because they can they can acquire
 
06:27:41.570 --> 06:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis so much cheaper uh
 
06:27:44.150 --> 06:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
well I'm sorry they can acquire cannabis
 
06:27:48.110 --> 06:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
for so much cheaper Maine is the Wild
 
06:27:50.690 --> 06:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
Wild West when it comes to cannabis and
 
06:27:53.090 --> 06:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily have some of the
 
06:27:55.788 --> 06:27:55.798 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations in place that
 
06:27:55.798 --> 06:27:57.548 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations in place that
prevent

06:27:57.548 --> 06:27:57.558 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
06:28:00.170 --> 06:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
bad cannabis from getting out to the
 
06:28:03.230 --> 06:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
public so that is always a risk medical
 
06:28:07.270 --> 06:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
home grow in my opinion is a necessity
 
06:28:12.890 --> 06:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
it allows a patient to be able to help
 
06:28:16.190 --> 06:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
supplement their supply that they are
 
06:28:18.410 --> 06:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
already currently receiving from an
 
06:28:20.350 --> 06:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment center
 
06:28:23.470 --> 06:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
and help defer costs for that patient
 
06:28:27.530 --> 06:28:27.540 align:start position:0%
for me I prefer to grow outside so sir I
 
06:28:30.350 --> 06:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
already have a 10 foot high 10 by 10 dog
 
06:28:32.750 --> 06:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
kennel at home waiting for this bill to
 
06:28:35.270 --> 06:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully go into law and that puppy's
 
06:28:38.628 --> 06:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
mine but for approximately a hundred and
 
06:28:42.708 --> 06:28:42.718 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars I will be able to grow a
 
06:28:44.208 --> 06:28:44.218 align:start position:0%
batch of cannabis and it could
 
06:28:46.250 --> 06:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
potentially give me even under the
 
06:28:48.230 --> 06:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
stipulations of this bill could
 
06:28:50.628 --> 06:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
potentially give me the enough cannabis
 
06:28:53.810 --> 06:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
to last me for three to four months out
 
06:28:55.208 --> 06:28:55.218 align:start position:0%
of the year
 
06:28:57.590 --> 06:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know this is a long time coming
 
06:28:59.868 --> 06:28:59.878 align:start position:0%
again we have a well-established program
 
06:29:02.510 --> 06:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
our patients have done absolutely
 
06:29:04.970 --> 06:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
nothing but prove time and time again
 
06:29:07.850 --> 06:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
how serious they are and how responsible
 
06:29:10.010 --> 06:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
they are in regards to their health and
 
06:29:12.048 --> 06:29:12.058 align:start position:0%
in regards to following the rules and
 
06:29:14.510 --> 06:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
stipulations of the program I think it's
 
06:29:17.090 --> 06:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
a no-brainer and that we should
 
06:29:20.150 --> 06:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
definitely definitely push for this bill
 
06:29:23.390 --> 06:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
to go into law I have I am aware of some
 
06:29:25.930 --> 06:29:25.940 align:start position:0%
of the Amendments that have
 
06:29:28.670 --> 06:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
requested and I agree with those as well
 
06:29:31.250 --> 06:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
they are just little changes but thank
 
06:29:35.570 --> 06:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:39.110 --> 06:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative Palazzo thank you Mr
 
06:29:41.510 --> 06:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
06:29:41.520 --> 06:29:43.010 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

06:29:43.010 --> 06:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:29:45.948 --> 06:29:45.958 align:start position:0%
uh I agree with General uh premise that
 
06:29:49.868 --> 06:29:49.878 align:start position:0%
a home cultivation will help especially
 
06:29:55.610 --> 06:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
uh people on low income but my uh I
 
06:29:58.430 --> 06:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
wonder since you gave us an example with
 
06:30:02.230 --> 06:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
certain uh in income level
 
06:30:05.810 --> 06:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
is it true that people on low income or
 
06:30:10.490 --> 06:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
like have some kinds of assistance with
 
06:30:14.330 --> 06:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
basic basic needs like Snap programs
 
06:30:17.708 --> 06:30:17.718 align:start position:0%
some have subsidized housing some might
 
06:30:20.868 --> 06:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
qualify for housing assistance or
 
06:30:25.070 --> 06:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
daycare assistance so do you see any of
 
06:30:28.190 --> 06:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
it and what other needs you see
 
06:30:31.610 --> 06:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
competing with the need for marijuana
 
06:30:37.610 --> 06:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:39.948 --> 06:30:39.958 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try and answer that as best
 
06:30:43.190 --> 06:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
as I can I
 
06:30:47.990 --> 06:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
I believe that even if a individual if I
 
06:30:49.690 --> 06:30:49.700 align:start position:0%
understood you correctly
 
06:30:53.090 --> 06:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
a low-income individual is receiving
 
06:30:56.150 --> 06:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
some sort of Public Assistance that that
 
06:30:59.510 --> 06:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
assistance is definitely not enough to
 
06:31:02.750 --> 06:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
offset the cost Associated around
 
06:31:05.750 --> 06:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis I think that
 
06:31:09.410 --> 06:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
regardless of those individuals are
 
06:31:12.310 --> 06:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
still being forced to pick and choose
 
06:31:17.690 --> 06:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
between paying a bill buying food or
 
06:31:20.448 --> 06:31:20.458 align:start position:0%
in my case being able to walk and
 
06:31:22.490 --> 06:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
function daily
 
06:31:24.708 --> 06:31:24.718 align:start position:0%
I hope that touched upon your question
 
06:31:29.990 --> 06:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:32.270 --> 06:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative Shapiro I would just
 
06:31:34.970 --> 06:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
like to suggest that we given the time
 
06:31:37.010 --> 06:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
and all the bills we have left that we
 
06:31:39.470 --> 06:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
really try extra hard to keep focused on
 
06:31:41.628 --> 06:31:41.638 align:start position:0%
the bill itself and not extraneous
 
06:31:45.110 --> 06:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
issues okay thank you
 
06:31:47.330 --> 06:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for this
 
06:31:47.340 --> 06:31:50.150 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for this
individual

06:31:50.150 --> 06:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:55.430 --> 06:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:58.490 --> 06:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak exactly uh that
 
06:32:08.628 --> 06:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:10.670 --> 06:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon committee members I'm
 
06:32:12.590 --> 06:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
here to express my full support for HB
 
06:32:15.530 --> 06:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
431 as a medical cannabis patient I have
 
06:32:17.570 --> 06:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
seen firsthand the positive impact that
 
06:32:19.730 --> 06:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
access to safe and affordable medicine
 
06:32:21.410 --> 06:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
can have on individuals living with
 
06:32:23.270 --> 06:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
chronic conditions and disabilities
 
06:32:25.670 --> 06:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
where medical homegirl is permitted
 
06:32:27.708 --> 06:32:27.718 align:start position:0%
medical homegirl offers patients like
 
06:32:29.690 --> 06:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
myself the ability to control the
 
06:32:31.250 --> 06:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
quality safety and cost of their
 
06:32:31.260 --> 06:32:32.330 align:start position:0%
quality safety and cost of their
medicine

06:32:32.330 --> 06:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
06:32:34.310 --> 06:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
with my cannabis res with my cannabis
 
06:32:36.590 --> 06:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
regimen and the prices at the local atcs
 
06:32:39.110 --> 06:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
I am looking at spending around 700 plus
 
06:32:41.390 --> 06:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
dollars a month for two ounces of
 
06:32:42.948 --> 06:32:42.958 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis
 
06:32:45.170 --> 06:32:45.180 align:start position:0%
furthermore we have seen over recent
 
06:32:47.390 --> 06:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
years how other states have expanded
 
06:32:49.430 --> 06:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
medical patient home growth rates due to
 
06:32:52.010 --> 06:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
the importance of such programs I urge
 
06:32:53.750 --> 06:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
you to support medical home growth
 
06:32:56.448 --> 06:32:56.458 align:start position:0%

personally am in favor of
 
06:34:17.750 --> 06:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
4th 431 a little bit input from the
 
06:34:20.030 --> 06:34:20.040 align:start position:0%

privacy rights and production from the
 
06:34:31.070 --> 06:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
illicit market now living in and I have
 
06:34:33.048 --> 06:34:33.058 align:start position:0%
a pretty great patient rights to home
 
06:34:35.090 --> 06:34:35.100 align:start position:0%
grow I have to make a little bit
 
06:34:37.610 --> 06:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
correction we actually have six mature
 
06:34:40.250 --> 06:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
plants 12 immature plants and unlimited
 
06:34:42.110 --> 06:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
seedlings and we Define our seedlings by
 
06:34:44.570 --> 06:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
24 by 24 inches wide an inches tall
 
06:34:48.170 --> 06:34:48.180 align:start position:0%
compared to HP 43 section 11a line three
 
06:34:50.208 --> 06:34:50.218 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire patients are allowed Three
 
06:34:52.250 --> 06:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
Mature plants three immature plants and
 
06:34:54.410 --> 06:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
12 seedlings and defined by six inches
 
06:34:56.868 --> 06:34:56.878 align:start position:0%
tall while we're for this and we love HP
 
06:34:59.990 --> 06:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
43 we would really really recommend uh
 
06:35:01.910 --> 06:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
that you maybe look based look at look
 
06:35:04.430 --> 06:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
at popping seeds as a statistic if you
 
06:35:06.170 --> 06:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
have 12 seeds to pop maybe they all
 
06:35:08.690 --> 06:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
don't pop maybe then you put them in the
 
06:35:10.548 --> 06:35:10.558 align:start position:0%
ground wrong maybe that only four come
 
06:35:12.048 --> 06:35:12.058 align:start position:0%
out of the ground so let's if we're
 
06:35:13.310 --> 06:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
going to get these people the home grow
 
06:35:15.770 --> 06:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
rights let's set it up correctly again
 
06:35:17.208 --> 06:35:17.218 align:start position:0%
this is your state though I'm not
 
06:35:18.770 --> 06:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
telling you what to do to be clear just
 
06:35:20.510 --> 06:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
a recommendation
 
06:35:22.190 --> 06:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
um same thing with immature plants I
 
06:35:23.570 --> 06:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
mean these people aren't getting high it
 
06:35:25.310 --> 06:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
takes eight to 13 weeks to flower a
 
06:35:27.170 --> 06:35:27.180 align:start position:0%
plant so it's like again these plants
 
06:35:28.368 --> 06:35:28.378 align:start position:0%
are just kind of Sitting In Limbo
 
06:35:30.288 --> 06:35:30.298 align:start position:0%
they're not causing any harm again you
 
06:35:32.090 --> 06:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
your state I'm not telling you what to
 
06:35:33.230 --> 06:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
do to be clear there's just
 
06:35:33.240 --> 06:35:34.448 align:start position:0%
do to be clear there's just
recommendations

06:35:34.448 --> 06:35:34.458 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
06:35:36.830 --> 06:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
I'm a patient I want to thank all the 20
 
06:35:37.970 --> 06:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
patients that let me represent them
 
06:35:40.610 --> 06:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
today and I personally want to thank you
 
06:35:42.350 --> 06:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
guys for listening driving out to Maine
 
06:35:44.270 --> 06:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions and most
 
06:35:46.070 --> 06:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
importantly I am a person not a party
 
06:35:47.990 --> 06:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:35:48.000 --> 06:35:50.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
questions

06:35:50.990 --> 06:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:53.690 --> 06:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
yes representative King thank you
 
06:35:55.430 --> 06:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
chairman McDonald you've been doing this
 
06:35:57.170 --> 06:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
for a long time I think you know what
 
06:35:59.390 --> 06:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
you're doing yes sir um
 
06:36:01.610 --> 06:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
do you think three plants mature and
 
06:36:04.610 --> 06:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
three immature is enough because it
 
06:36:07.970 --> 06:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's not enough and you have
 
06:36:10.430 --> 06:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
um you have experience with this sort of
 
06:36:12.170 --> 06:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
thing yes would it be better do you
 
06:36:13.490 --> 06:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
think for us to just get something
 
06:36:15.530 --> 06:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
through anything through now or should
 
06:36:17.330 --> 06:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
we just go right for the jugular and say
 
06:36:20.570 --> 06:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
12 plants mature 12 plan plants immature
 
06:36:23.230 --> 06:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
or or better I mean we are delivered
 
06:36:26.510 --> 06:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
just a second just to go on I don't know
 
06:36:27.948 --> 06:36:27.958 align:start position:0%
any of your names by chance so I
 
06:36:30.110 --> 06:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
apologize you made a good point about it
 
06:36:31.548 --> 06:36:31.558 align:start position:0%
depends do you guys want to slam this
 
06:36:33.650 --> 06:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
through or get it done right
 
06:36:35.448 --> 06:36:35.458 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean because like at the
 
06:36:37.010 --> 06:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
end of the day when you are limiting
 
06:36:38.270 --> 06:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
like in here in Maine right now I'm
 
06:36:40.250 --> 06:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
actually fighting to bills to eliminate
 
06:36:42.048 --> 06:36:42.058 align:start position:0%
plant Cal that's what I'm doing in my
 
06:36:43.548 --> 06:36:43.558 align:start position:0%
state house right now
 
06:36:45.230 --> 06:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
um so I'm again not recommending that
 
06:36:46.788 --> 06:36:46.798 align:start position:0%
for you guys but I think you should
 
06:36:49.490 --> 06:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
absolutely think about the not even how
 
06:36:51.230 --> 06:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
you feel about cannabis just think of
 
06:36:53.390 --> 06:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
the statistics of making a popping a
 
06:36:55.310 --> 06:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
plant growing a plant don't care what it
 
06:36:56.690 --> 06:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
is think about the statistics of the
 
06:36:58.010 --> 06:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
plants seedlings aren't hurting anyone
 
06:37:00.650 --> 06:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
you can't even sex a plant at six inches
 
06:37:02.810 --> 06:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
tall you can't even sex a plant so even
 
06:37:04.190 --> 06:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
then after that let's just say all the
 
06:37:06.288 --> 06:37:06.298 align:start position:0%
seeds pop let's say you well for your
 
06:37:09.048 --> 06:37:09.058 align:start position:0%
law pop twelve seeds you know eight come
 
06:37:11.208 --> 06:37:11.218 align:start position:0%
out of the ground cool and then I have
 
06:37:12.890 --> 06:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
to wait till their past six inches to
 
06:37:15.110 --> 06:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
sex them so then even then I might have
 
06:37:17.150 --> 06:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
five males that are useless and then
 
06:37:19.070 --> 06:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
then I leave the next next to one plant
 
06:37:22.190 --> 06:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
one in mature plant and then whatever so
 
06:37:24.230 --> 06:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
that's all my point is I don't want to
 
06:37:25.430 --> 06:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
sit here and tell you how to run your
 
06:37:27.350 --> 06:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
program because this is not my state I
 
06:37:28.970 --> 06:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
just listen to patients that love
 
06:37:31.368 --> 06:37:31.378 align:start position:0%
Maine's program and
 
06:37:32.990 --> 06:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's all I'm here to do
 
06:37:34.310 --> 06:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
because I think it's really important
 
06:37:35.390 --> 06:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
that if you guys want to pass a home
 
06:37:37.010 --> 06:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
Grill bill right you give these patients
 
06:37:39.288 --> 06:37:39.298 align:start position:0%
the access give these people what they
 
06:37:41.510 --> 06:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
want and not let them fail because right
 
06:37:43.250 --> 06:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
now you will be back here again if you
 
06:37:45.350 --> 06:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
pass it as is but again my patients just
 
06:37:47.030 --> 06:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
want home grow right so they really care
 
06:37:48.890 --> 06:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
how it's written but that's where I step
 
06:37:50.448 --> 06:37:50.458 align:start position:0%
in and understand the bill a little bit
 
06:37:52.850 --> 06:37:52.860 align:start position:0%
more than the average patient but I am
 
06:37:54.948 --> 06:37:54.958 align:start position:0%
just a patient at the end of the day
 
06:37:56.750 --> 06:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
um but the big thing is let's set these
 
06:37:58.670 --> 06:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
people up to fail let's do it right the
 
06:38:00.288 --> 06:38:00.298 align:start position:0%
first time I know it's hard to get
 
06:38:01.730 --> 06:38:01.740 align:start position:0%
through this Senate I thought my Senate
 
06:38:03.948 --> 06:38:03.958 align:start position:0%
made many years I'm a cannabis felon I'm
 
06:38:05.570 --> 06:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
proud of it and that's why I wear my
 
06:38:07.430 --> 06:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
handcuffs today because I will fight for
 
06:38:08.990 --> 06:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
these rights for these patients until
 
06:38:10.490 --> 06:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
I'm blue in the face I don't care what
 
06:38:12.590 --> 06:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
state I'm in but when you're when you're
 
06:38:14.390 --> 06:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
affected by a felony in Camp sorry I'm
 
06:38:16.250 --> 06:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
sorry so I'm getting off topic but yes
 
06:38:18.590 --> 06:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
to answer your question if you want to
 
06:38:20.448 --> 06:38:20.458 align:start position:0%
get it through get it through and just
 
06:38:22.730 --> 06:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
do it as is but if you actually have the
 
06:38:25.490 --> 06:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
the power the actual numbers to get it
 
06:38:27.650 --> 06:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
done right get it done right that's my
 
06:38:29.868 --> 06:38:29.878 align:start position:0%
just my recommendation do whatever you
 
06:38:32.030 --> 06:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
want in your state Live Free or Die
 
06:38:34.670 --> 06:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:38:36.590 --> 06:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other questions all right
 
06:38:39.230 --> 06:38:39.240 align:start position:0%

06:39:16.430 --> 06:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
always be a mother and one to a cannabis

06:39:17.890 --> 06:39:17.900 align:start position:0%
patient
 
06:39:20.208 --> 06:39:20.218 align:start position:0%
on this journey of fighting for cannabis
 
06:39:22.128 --> 06:39:22.138 align:start position:0%
laws I'm honored to say I dedicated my
 
06:39:23.810 --> 06:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
life to the medical form and cannabis
 
06:39:26.150 --> 06:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
education and development I developed a
 
06:39:27.890 --> 06:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
company that has been nominated 20 plus
 
06:39:30.048 --> 06:39:30.058 align:start position:0%
times won three awards for cannabis
 
06:39:31.970 --> 06:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
Innovation and most recently I was
 
06:39:33.890 --> 06:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
awarded East Coast woman role model for
 
06:39:36.110 --> 06:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
my work in cannabis I have seen it from
 
06:39:37.970 --> 06:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
both parts and I've seen this state from
 
06:39:40.310 --> 06:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
the start almost a decade ago a New
 
06:39:42.230 --> 06:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident had to sue the state
 
06:39:44.390 --> 06:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
to get medical cards available to her
 
06:39:46.730 --> 06:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
it's too many years now that have passed
 
06:39:49.070 --> 06:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
to continue this delay in developments
 
06:39:51.590 --> 06:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
the delay in developments has affected
 
06:39:53.150 --> 06:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
my daughter my daughter has an
 
06:39:55.128 --> 06:39:55.138 align:start position:0%
autoimmune disease in a form of epilepsy
 
06:39:57.350 --> 06:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
at one time opiates and sedatives the
 
06:39:59.750 --> 06:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
only option given for her after failed
 
06:40:01.788 --> 06:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical options cannabis was
 
06:40:03.650 --> 06:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
suggested but in this state when she was
 
06:40:05.628 --> 06:40:05.638 align:start position:0%
an infant there wasn't a
 
06:40:07.010 --> 06:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
well-established medical cannabis
 
06:40:09.890 --> 06:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
program similar to now sadly and as a
 
06:40:12.110 --> 06:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
family we had to move to Maine who had
 
06:40:13.788 --> 06:40:13.798 align:start position:0%
already developed a medical cannabis
 
06:40:15.708 --> 06:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
program having to move my daughter to
 
06:40:18.230 --> 06:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
get care still seems unfair so I ask you
 
06:40:19.670 --> 06:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
see the delay in changes in New
 
06:40:21.770 --> 06:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is keeping walls in place that
 
06:40:24.410 --> 06:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
need to come down in Maine as a mother a
 
06:40:26.090 --> 06:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
patient a caregiver and a business owner
 
06:40:27.770 --> 06:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
in the Cannabis industry the past eight
 
06:40:30.170 --> 06:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
years I have seen both sides this year I
 
06:40:31.368 --> 06:40:31.378 align:start position:0%
brought my daughter home to New
 
06:40:33.170 --> 06:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as soon as I brought her here
 
06:40:35.810 --> 06:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
though I saw all the same things I stood
 
06:40:37.910 --> 06:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
and fought for so long ago
 
06:40:40.430 --> 06:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
the medical program needs to be Advanced
 
06:40:42.288 --> 06:40:42.298 align:start position:0%
I just want to share a very short
 
06:40:44.330 --> 06:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
scenario with you for most of us when we
 
06:40:46.548 --> 06:40:46.558 align:start position:0%
go to get a medication we go to a
 
06:40:49.070 --> 06:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
pharmacy but for a lot of us even being
 
06:40:50.810 --> 06:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
able to pick up our medication at that
 
06:40:52.548 --> 06:40:52.558 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy sometimes it's gut-wrenching
 
06:40:54.048 --> 06:40:54.058 align:start position:0%
because of the high cost but available
 
06:40:56.208 --> 06:40:56.218 align:start position:0%
to all of you is the access to that
 
06:40:58.910 --> 06:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
correct medication Insurance help and
 
06:41:00.410 --> 06:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
sitting in the counter right there in
 
06:41:02.750 --> 06:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
front of you an RX discount card for all
 
06:41:04.490 --> 06:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
medication to help with that cost that
 
06:41:06.890 --> 06:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
medication for me that's not how it
 
06:41:08.810 --> 06:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
works with the Cannabis Medical
 
06:41:10.310 --> 06:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
certain patients like my daughter
 
06:41:12.530 --> 06:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
require certain strand of cannabis there
 
06:41:13.910 --> 06:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
is a different plant with a different
 
06:41:16.490 --> 06:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
compound for certain illnesses and that
 
06:41:18.350 --> 06:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
strand isn't even available in New
 
06:41:21.770 --> 06:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I want to say I want to
 
06:41:23.690 --> 06:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
substitute it like you could generically
 
06:41:24.948 --> 06:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
at a pharmacy
 
06:41:26.810 --> 06:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
I'd need amounts that cost in the
 
06:41:28.670 --> 06:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
thousands because of the prices and the
 
06:41:30.230 --> 06:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
lack of development here regarding
 
06:41:32.930 --> 06:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
cannabis education and development these
 
06:41:34.788 --> 06:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
limited state-run dispensaries for some
 
06:41:37.310 --> 06:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
patients are hours hours away so highly
 
06:41:39.230 --> 06:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
priced because our state refuses to
 
06:41:41.208 --> 06:41:41.218 align:start position:0%
allow residents doctors parents to be
 
06:41:44.208 --> 06:41:44.218 align:start position:0%
involved in cannabis education expansion
 
06:41:46.670 --> 06:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
this is what our program needs education
 
06:41:48.350 --> 06:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
what I learned going through this
 
06:41:49.970 --> 06:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
process in another state there were
 
06:41:51.590 --> 06:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
States who faced this battle to make
 
06:41:53.690 --> 06:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
this decision and with growth mindset
 
06:41:55.310 --> 06:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
had developed and have put in place
 
06:41:57.890 --> 06:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
guidelines and Guys these guidelines are
 
06:41:57.900 --> 06:41:58.750 align:start position:0%
guidelines and Guys these guidelines are
simple

06:41:58.750 --> 06:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
simple
 
06:42:01.250 --> 06:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
this is simple grow the plant that the
 
06:42:03.288 --> 06:42:03.298 align:start position:0%
doctors were teaching us about just like
 
06:42:05.930 --> 06:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
any new medical device or medication so
 
06:42:08.270 --> 06:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
many states have been proven and had
 
06:42:10.670 --> 06:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
positive outcomes advancing their
 
06:42:13.430 --> 06:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis programs in most staged
 
06:42:15.048 --> 06:42:15.058 align:start position:0%
medical patients are given the
 
06:42:17.208 --> 06:42:17.218 align:start position:0%
opportunity and education to be able to
 
06:42:19.730 --> 06:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
grow their own cannabis this is a very
 
06:42:21.708 --> 06:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
important part like New Hampshire who is
 
06:42:23.930 --> 06:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
not fully established like the
 
06:42:26.150 --> 06:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
surrounding programs speaking as a
 
06:42:27.890 --> 06:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
mother I will always pick a plant versus
 
06:42:30.288 --> 06:42:30.298 align:start position:0%
pain medication who is proven to be
 
06:42:32.810 --> 06:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
addictive an opiate addict can go into a
 
06:42:35.690 --> 06:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
pharmacy and get in a free needle to
 
06:42:37.730 --> 06:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
ingest an illegal deadly substance but
 
06:42:39.230 --> 06:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
yet I can't grow my daughter's
 
06:42:41.270 --> 06:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
plant-based doctor-prescribed medication
 
06:42:43.368 --> 06:42:43.378 align:start position:0%
with guidance he could stop wrapping up
 
06:42:45.410 --> 06:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
ma'am absolutely I want to end this by
 
06:42:46.970 --> 06:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
one more important fact with the new
 
06:42:49.970 --> 06:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
practice guidelines the CDC updated last
 
06:42:51.948 --> 06:42:51.958 align:start position:0%
year regarding new guidelines and
 
06:42:55.548 --> 06:42:55.558 align:start position:0%
prescribing doctors giving them uh
 
06:42:57.350 --> 06:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
giving them guidelines to follow like
 
06:42:59.750 --> 06:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
Oxycontin the CDC established this
 
06:43:01.548 --> 06:43:01.558 align:start position:0%
trying to curb the epidemic of addiction
 
06:43:04.250 --> 06:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
and abuse and I support it but now we're
 
06:43:06.650 --> 06:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
going to be seeking seeing more cannabis
 
06:43:10.250 --> 06:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
patients and doctors to seek Alternative
 
06:43:12.230 --> 06:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
Care and that is going to be cannabis
 
06:43:14.030 --> 06:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
all states will see an increase in
 
06:43:15.470 --> 06:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
patients looking to find a replacement
 
06:43:17.390 --> 06:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
to treat pain with the new CDC
 
06:43:19.670 --> 06:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines don't let that replacement be
 
06:43:21.770 --> 06:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
an illegal deadly less priced drug on
 
06:43:23.930 --> 06:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
the street let the doctors help them to
 
06:43:25.910 --> 06:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
learn to grow and a healthier
 
06:43:28.670 --> 06:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
plant-based way to treat their pain and
 
06:43:28.680 --> 06:43:29.810 align:start position:0%
plant-based way to treat their pain and
thrive

06:43:29.810 --> 06:43:29.820 align:start position:0%
thrive
 
06:43:31.788 --> 06:43:31.798 align:start position:0%

06:54:15.948 --> 06:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
okay do I have a motion on do we want to
 
06:54:17.510 --> 06:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
consider the amendment first is that
 
06:54:20.270 --> 06:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we do have an amendment on HB 397
 
06:54:22.250 --> 06:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
representative Leon is going to
 
06:54:24.048 --> 06:54:24.058 align:start position:0%
distribute that
 
06:54:26.090 --> 06:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
um thank you I'd like to and I have it
 
06:54:29.590 --> 06:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
right here it's Amendment uh
 
06:54:33.048 --> 06:54:33.058 align:start position:0%
2023-0459h it's an amendment to 397.
 
06:54:35.090 --> 06:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
um I may I wasn't sure if it was better
 
06:54:37.070 --> 06:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
to include representative merchant after
 
06:54:39.650 --> 06:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
without having an exact perfect sign off
 
06:54:41.510 --> 06:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
or not include him so I apologize for
 
06:54:43.128 --> 06:54:43.138 align:start position:0%
leaving him off I just thought it'd be
 
06:54:44.510 --> 06:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
worse to include him if he did not want
 
06:54:47.030 --> 06:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
to be part of it
 
06:55:00.048 --> 06:55:00.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:03.368 --> 06:55:03.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:10.730 --> 06:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:12.468 --> 06:55:12.478 align:start position:0%
it's a big department
 
06:55:27.948 --> 06:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:29.868 --> 06:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
representative McLean we are about to
 
06:55:31.788 --> 06:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
consider an amendment to fortnite to
 
06:55:37.730 --> 06:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:38.930 --> 06:55:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:55:40.850 --> 06:55:40.860 align:start position:0%
it's fine and you left one for Mark
 
06:55:47.270 --> 06:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:48.948 --> 06:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
speak to sure
 
06:55:50.750 --> 06:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative Leon is recognized to
 
06:55:52.128 --> 06:55:52.138 align:start position:0%
speak to the amendment
 
06:55:54.890 --> 06:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman as as we were
 
06:55:56.628 --> 06:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill it seems pretty
 
06:55:58.548 --> 06:55:58.558 align:start position:0%
clear that people had there was some
 
06:56:01.850 --> 06:56:01.860 align:start position:0%
concern around having the needle
 
06:56:03.708 --> 06:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
exchange program included in this
 
06:56:06.468 --> 06:56:06.478 align:start position:0%
because people are worried about misuse
 
06:56:09.770 --> 06:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
of needles and misuse of drugs
 
06:56:13.190 --> 06:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
that part was removed from
 
06:56:15.048 --> 06:56:15.058 align:start position:0%
so that part is missing when you look at
 
06:56:17.930 --> 06:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
this at line 10 of the amendment and
 
06:56:20.330 --> 06:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
line 20 of the amendment in both of
 
06:56:22.070 --> 06:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
those sections
 
06:56:25.250 --> 06:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
another change to this was that there
 
06:56:27.350 --> 06:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
are a bunch of innovative drug drug
 
06:56:29.510 --> 06:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
delivery Technologies which DO
 
06:56:31.788 --> 06:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
Incorporated hypodermic needle but
 
06:56:34.010 --> 06:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
they're Incorporated in such a way that
 
06:56:36.048 --> 06:56:36.058 align:start position:0%
the FDA doesn't allow them to be
 
06:56:38.990 --> 06:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
approved if they can be used to misuse
 
06:56:42.048 --> 06:56:42.058 align:start position:0%
drugs if you can substitute another drug
 
06:56:45.110 --> 06:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
into a pain patch or anything else it
 
06:56:46.910 --> 06:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
would not be approved by the FDA and it
 
06:56:48.948 --> 06:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
would not be allowed this is actually an
 
06:56:50.690 --> 06:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
area where I had quite a bit of
 
06:56:52.128 --> 06:56:52.138 align:start position:0%
knowledge working with insulate and
 
06:56:54.170 --> 06:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
other couple companies on drug delivery
 
06:56:57.468 --> 06:56:57.478 align:start position:0%
and avoiding misuse of them so for that
 
06:56:59.930 --> 06:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
reason the statute is being changed to
 
06:57:02.448 --> 06:57:02.458 align:start position:0%
talk about controller possession of a
 
06:57:05.390 --> 06:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
hypodermic syringe or hypodermic needle
 
06:57:07.548 --> 06:57:07.558 align:start position:0%
because when you include any instrument
 
06:57:09.590 --> 06:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
adapted for the administration of drugs
 
06:57:11.628 --> 06:57:11.638 align:start position:0%
by injection you're looking about
 
06:57:13.850 --> 06:57:13.860 align:start position:0%
looking at Innovative Technologies that
 
06:57:15.770 --> 06:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
really don't present a risk here and it
 
06:57:17.868 --> 06:57:17.878 align:start position:0%
just just confuses the issue this would
 
06:57:19.490 --> 06:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
then mean that if somebody had an EpiPen
 
06:57:21.650 --> 06:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
and you handed off the EpiPen the EpiPen
 
06:57:24.110 --> 06:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
06:57:25.610 --> 06:57:25.620 align:start position:0%
you could even make the case that that
 
06:57:27.530 --> 06:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
an EpiPen it does have the have the
 
06:57:29.690 --> 06:57:29.700 align:start position:0%
hypodermic needle in there but this
 
06:57:31.490 --> 06:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
protects a lot of those other uses where
 
06:57:34.430 --> 06:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to be going astray
 
06:57:37.250 --> 06:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
um the other part is that it adds under
 
06:57:41.330 --> 06:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
direct supervision so that if they were
 
06:57:43.610 --> 06:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
in position in possession of the
 
06:57:45.590 --> 06:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
hypodermic syringe or hypodermic needle
 
06:57:48.288 --> 06:57:48.298 align:start position:0%
the authorized agent that's a youth
 
06:57:49.430 --> 06:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
would be need to be under direct
 
06:57:51.410 --> 06:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
supervision that's something where a
 
06:57:52.910 --> 06:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
babysitter wise you can figure out how
 
06:57:54.110 --> 06:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
that would be interpreted but this
 
06:57:55.910 --> 06:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
provides a lot more interpret a lot more
 
06:57:59.208 --> 06:57:59.218 align:start position:0%
protection and protects those uses where
 
06:58:01.150 --> 06:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
you're asking a child to hold your bag
 
06:58:03.830 --> 06:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
and somebody doesn't like you they know
 
06:58:05.750 --> 06:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
you're a diabetic and they choose that
 
06:58:07.910 --> 06:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
moment that that's the thing we've dealt
 
06:58:09.650 --> 06:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
with all sorts of excess and policing
 
06:58:11.030 --> 06:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
and we just want to remove each of those
 
06:58:13.730 --> 06:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
opportunities for misuse and lastly it
 
06:58:15.890 --> 06:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
adds the phrase use of a hypodermic
 
06:58:17.990 --> 06:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
syringe or hypodermic needle contrary to
 
06:58:19.310 --> 06:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
the antenna the prescription is not
 
06:58:21.288 --> 06:58:21.298 align:start position:0%
permitted under the statute so if
 
06:58:22.850 --> 06:58:22.860 align:start position:0%
somebody's misusing their parents
 
06:58:25.368 --> 06:58:25.378 align:start position:0%
insulin syringe it's not protected so I
 
06:58:27.230 --> 06:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
think that this addresses everybody's
 
06:58:28.490 --> 06:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
concerns I'd love to hear if there's
 
06:58:30.170 --> 06:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
anything that wasn't addressed in our
 
06:58:34.128 --> 06:58:34.138 align:start position:0%
Amendment but hopefully this is good
 
06:58:36.170 --> 06:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
so you're moving the amendment I take it
 
06:58:38.030 --> 06:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative Leon yes so I move this
 
06:58:39.410 --> 06:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
amendment is there a second to the
 
06:58:41.410 --> 06:58:41.420 align:start position:0%
motion yes representative
 
06:58:45.288 --> 06:58:45.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:49.490 --> 06:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
well for the purposes of a second
 
06:58:51.410 --> 06:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
all right so do you have any further
 
06:58:53.930 --> 06:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
comment on this representative Leon or
 
06:58:55.968 --> 06:58:55.978 align:start position:0%
um I I think I said what needed to be
 
06:58:58.610 --> 06:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
said any other okay any other discussion
 
06:59:00.770 --> 06:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman just wanted to thank
 
06:59:02.448 --> 06:59:02.458 align:start position:0%
representative Leon for working with me
 
06:59:05.208 --> 06:59:05.218 align:start position:0%
on this amendment uh does dress the
 
06:59:07.128 --> 06:59:07.138 align:start position:0%
concerns that I heard the ones I had
 
06:59:09.468 --> 06:59:09.478 align:start position:0%
specifically and that dealt with
 
06:59:12.890 --> 06:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
needle exchange program that a miner
 
06:59:14.810 --> 06:59:14.820 align:start position:0%
could have access to a needle that was
 
06:59:16.430 --> 06:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
not prescribed to them or prescribed to
 
06:59:17.868 --> 06:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
somebody so took care of that concern
 
06:59:19.788 --> 06:59:19.798 align:start position:0%
and the other one when talked about
 
06:59:21.170 --> 06:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
contrary to the intent of the
 
06:59:23.448 --> 06:59:23.458 align:start position:0%
prescription is the antenna by the FDA
 
06:59:25.190 --> 06:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
but also the intent of How It's
 
06:59:27.288 --> 06:59:27.298 align:start position:0%
prescribed so therefore takes care of
 
06:59:29.090 --> 06:59:29.100 align:start position:0%
the issue of using it in some manner
 
06:59:31.010 --> 06:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
that was never intended but by the
 
06:59:31.020 --> 06:59:32.090 align:start position:0%
that was never intended but by the
describer

06:59:32.090 --> 06:59:32.100 align:start position:0%
describer
 
06:59:35.090 --> 06:59:35.100 align:start position:0%
so I totally support the amendment
 
06:59:37.310 --> 06:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
thank you other discussion
 
06:59:39.830 --> 06:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative King thank you Mr
 
06:59:39.840 --> 06:59:41.150 align:start position:0%
yes representative King thank you Mr
chair

06:59:41.150 --> 06:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
chair
 
06:59:44.030 --> 06:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
um so we added under direct supervision
 
06:59:47.330 --> 06:59:47.340 align:start position:0%
and I'm concerned that maybe somebody
 
06:59:49.788 --> 06:59:49.798 align:start position:0%
like the mother who testified she might
 
06:59:51.350 --> 06:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
keep needles in her car all the time
 
06:59:53.930 --> 06:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
daughter borrows the car she's not under
 
06:59:55.968 --> 06:59:55.978 align:start position:0%
direct supervision now all of a sudden
 
06:59:59.030 --> 06:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
she's potentially having life ruining
 
07:00:00.890 --> 07:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
felony charges
 
07:00:02.570 --> 07:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't understand why we
 
07:00:04.490 --> 07:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
why we put that in there I'd rather that
 
07:00:07.010 --> 07:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
not be there personally so I don't know
 
07:00:10.910 --> 07:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:12.590 --> 07:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you I definitely understand
 
07:00:15.110 --> 07:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
that point and I do think that there
 
07:00:17.030 --> 07:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
could be a risk of not removing those
 
07:00:19.548 --> 07:00:19.558 align:start position:0%
needles from a car but there are certain
 
07:00:22.070 --> 07:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
situations where we're taking certain
 
07:00:24.288 --> 07:00:24.298 align:start position:0%
instruments with you makes sense I
 
07:00:25.788 --> 07:00:25.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't leave my firearm in the car
 
07:00:28.610 --> 07:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
obviously hypodermic measles are a
 
07:00:31.010 --> 07:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
longer term risk for similar for similar
 
07:00:32.810 --> 07:00:32.820 align:start position:0%
potential outcomes
 
07:00:35.288 --> 07:00:35.298 align:start position:0%
um but if you have a bag full of
 
07:00:37.250 --> 07:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
hypodermic needles that are a part of it
 
07:00:40.190 --> 07:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
I would think that that
 
07:00:40.200 --> 07:00:41.090 align:start position:0%
I would think that that
foreign

07:00:41.090 --> 07:00:41.100 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
07:00:42.830 --> 07:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
I think that that's when we're also
 
07:00:44.690 --> 07:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
looking at do we have at 16 and older
 
07:00:47.090 --> 07:00:47.100 align:start position:0%
for the delivery and all of this this is
 
07:00:48.170 --> 07:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
where I was trying to get for the
 
07:00:51.708 --> 07:00:51.718 align:start position:0%
compromise this may be something that
 
07:00:53.150 --> 07:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing to bring even into
 
07:00:55.310 --> 07:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
the senate for us to for them to take a
 
07:00:56.810 --> 07:00:56.820 align:start position:0%
look and see I know it's best if they're
 
07:00:58.430 --> 07:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
the same but I don't this is an early
 
07:01:00.110 --> 07:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
bill so it would be good to get it out
 
07:01:00.120 --> 07:01:01.490 align:start position:0%
bill so it would be good to get it out
early

07:01:01.490 --> 07:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
early
 
07:01:02.750 --> 07:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's going to criminal
 
07:01:04.368 --> 07:01:04.378 align:start position:0%
justice so we can probably take another
 
07:01:06.110 --> 07:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
bite of the apple of that of trying to
 
07:01:07.368 --> 07:01:07.378 align:start position:0%
make it so that it has that correct
 
07:01:09.590 --> 07:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
intent I don't know if there'd be desire
 
07:01:12.170 --> 07:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
to change that direct supervision or if
 
07:01:13.368 --> 07:01:13.378 align:start position:0%
this is something that gets the general
 
07:01:15.708 --> 07:01:15.718 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill out
 
07:01:18.170 --> 07:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
um while meeting meeting most of the
 
07:01:20.090 --> 07:01:20.100 align:start position:0%
need while it does leave some potential
 
07:01:21.770 --> 07:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
exposure but we've reduced a lot of
 
07:01:23.390 --> 07:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
exposure to risk here
 
07:01:25.850 --> 07:01:25.860 align:start position:0%
can I follow up with that follow up um
 
07:01:27.288 --> 07:01:27.298 align:start position:0%
so I like the fact that you mentioned
 
07:01:29.990 --> 07:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
that it later with the joint session
 
07:01:31.730 --> 07:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
with the senate or something that it
 
07:01:33.288 --> 07:01:33.298 align:start position:0%
could potentially be taken out and I I
 
07:01:35.150 --> 07:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
just I would like to see it taken out
 
07:01:38.510 --> 07:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
because I know for example my sister was
 
07:01:42.468 --> 07:01:42.478 align:start position:0%
type one is type 1 diabetic and um
 
07:01:44.390 --> 07:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
there's been times let's just say where
 
07:01:46.490 --> 07:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
you know she has to throw away her
 
07:01:49.250 --> 07:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
needles in like a specific way and lots
 
07:01:51.410 --> 07:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
of times it ends up in a huge garbage
 
07:01:53.510 --> 07:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
bag in the back of her car and she
 
07:01:54.830 --> 07:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
drives on her for three months before
 
07:01:56.930 --> 07:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
she I mean and so it's just brutal that
 
07:01:59.930 --> 07:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
somebody else could borrow that car and
 
07:02:02.090 --> 07:02:02.100 align:start position:0%
have their life completely ruined
 
07:02:04.310 --> 07:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
because of some let's just say
 
07:02:05.930 --> 07:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
delinquency of my system you know what I
 
07:02:07.850 --> 07:02:07.860 align:start position:0%
mean so I don't know I just I I I
 
07:02:10.128 --> 07:02:10.138 align:start position:0%
personally hate the idea of people going
 
07:02:11.690 --> 07:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
to jail for something they did nothing
 
07:02:13.548 --> 07:02:13.558 align:start position:0%
wrong and to me putting that back in
 
07:02:16.310 --> 07:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
there just it just allows them oh you're
 
07:02:17.810 --> 07:02:17.820 align:start position:0%
not under direct supervision the other
 
07:02:19.310 --> 07:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
person's in the other room we're going
 
07:02:21.170 --> 07:02:21.180 align:start position:0%
to ruin your life now so I would just
 
07:02:22.548 --> 07:02:22.558 align:start position:0%
like to see it gone but I will vote for
 
07:02:25.310 --> 07:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment but I just want to get as
 
07:02:27.650 --> 07:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
few people in prison as possible and
 
07:02:29.628 --> 07:02:29.638 align:start position:0%
that just adds potentially more people
 
07:02:31.730 --> 07:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
in prison that's how I see it thank you
 
07:02:33.650 --> 07:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
07:02:36.230 --> 07:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
so I have two comments to make and reply
 
07:02:40.910 --> 07:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
to that one of which is although I
 
07:02:42.830 --> 07:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
really truly understand the discomfort
 
07:02:46.850 --> 07:02:46.860 align:start position:0%
that led to the bringing of this bill
 
07:02:46.860 --> 07:02:47.570 align:start position:0%
that led to the bringing of this bill
um

07:02:47.570 --> 07:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:02:51.468 --> 07:02:51.478 align:start position:0%
I my initial reaction was this is a
 
07:02:53.690 --> 07:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem I don't
 
07:02:56.628 --> 07:02:56.638 align:start position:0%
know of people who are going to jail for
 
07:02:58.670 --> 07:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
appropriately helping
 
07:03:02.708 --> 07:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
uh people when they are ill
 
07:03:07.548 --> 07:03:07.558 align:start position:0%
but secondly I will also say that you or
 
07:03:10.190 --> 07:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
anyone else can approach your Senator or
 
07:03:13.788 --> 07:03:13.798 align:start position:0%
testify at a senate hearing and ask them
 
07:03:17.628 --> 07:03:17.638 align:start position:0%
to do whatever changes you want and
 
07:03:19.430 --> 07:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
people from this committee have done it
 
07:03:22.128 --> 07:03:22.138 align:start position:0%
all the time sometimes to the
 
07:03:23.690 --> 07:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
gratification of the committee and
 
07:03:25.430 --> 07:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes to the intense annoyance of
 
07:03:27.590 --> 07:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee so that's
 
07:03:30.948 --> 07:03:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:34.730 --> 07:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:36.530 --> 07:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
07:03:40.150 --> 07:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
chair um this looks good to me but I I
 
07:03:43.070 --> 07:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
on line 19 unless the recipient is
 
07:03:45.770 --> 07:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
acting as an authorized agent for
 
07:03:49.610 --> 07:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
another is defined by RSA 318
 
07:03:52.670 --> 07:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
um colon 42. I'm I have that up but it's
 
07:03:56.090 --> 07:03:56.100 align:start position:0%
a it's a long section is do you have a
 
07:03:57.890 --> 07:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
reference to where it actually defines
 
07:04:00.230 --> 07:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
what an authorized agent is
 
07:04:01.368 --> 07:04:01.378 align:start position:0%
um thank you it's actually in the
 
07:04:03.610 --> 07:04:03.620 align:start position:0%
section above I did not see that they
 
07:04:06.590 --> 07:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
deleted the comma I
 
07:04:09.770 --> 07:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
that is in the section above that
 
07:04:09.780 --> 07:04:10.548 align:start position:0%
that is in the section above that
um

07:04:10.548 --> 07:04:10.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:04:13.368 --> 07:04:13.378 align:start position:0%
that maybe I know that occasionally
 
07:04:15.948 --> 07:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
those minor clerical things like that
 
07:04:17.868 --> 07:04:17.878 align:start position:0%
can be cleaned up hopefully that's
 
07:04:19.548 --> 07:04:19.558 align:start position:0%
something that we can move forward with
 
07:04:21.650 --> 07:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
this even with that missing three okay I
 
07:04:23.690 --> 07:04:23.700 align:start position:0%
just thought you might be you might have
 
07:04:26.448 --> 07:04:26.458 align:start position:0%
on the on line 20
 
07:04:29.208 --> 07:04:29.218 align:start position:0%
it's on it's on line 10 but not line 20.
 
07:04:31.310 --> 07:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative Weber do you
 
07:04:33.410 --> 07:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
oh yeah so now I was going to State
 
07:04:35.628 --> 07:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
about the cleaning up of the clerical
 
07:04:38.030 --> 07:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
errors I did check with the clerk when
 
07:04:40.128 --> 07:04:40.138 align:start position:0%
we had our issue about section one and
 
07:04:43.190 --> 07:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
section two and he did confirm that that
 
07:04:45.530 --> 07:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
is the kind of thing that we could have
 
07:04:49.010 --> 07:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
passed that with the error and it would
 
07:04:52.548 --> 07:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
have been in changing the amendment into
 
07:04:54.410 --> 07:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
a committee Amendment it would have been
 
07:04:56.090 --> 07:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
taken care of we could have noted that
 
07:04:58.548 --> 07:04:58.558 align:start position:0%
so I think in in this case that's also
 
07:05:00.288 --> 07:05:00.298 align:start position:0%
something that can be noted and taken
 
07:05:02.448 --> 07:05:02.458 align:start position:0%
care of when it becomes a Committee
 
07:05:05.330 --> 07:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
Member if the committee votes it thank
 
07:05:05.340 --> 07:05:06.830 align:start position:0%
Member if the committee votes it thank
you

07:05:06.830 --> 07:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:05:09.948 --> 07:05:09.958 align:start position:0%
any other discussion
 
07:05:12.288 --> 07:05:12.298 align:start position:0%
okay if there's no other discussion I
 
07:05:14.628 --> 07:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
will ask the clerk to call the wall so
 
07:05:17.350 --> 07:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
the motion is ought to pass on Amendment
 
07:05:22.788 --> 07:05:22.798 align:start position:0%

07:08:11.810 --> 07:08:11.820 align:start position:0%
chairman I move an expedient to
 
07:08:16.010 --> 07:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 338--fm
 
07:08:19.310 --> 07:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:21.048 --> 07:08:21.058 align:start position:0%
I'll second that
 
07:08:23.350 --> 07:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative King okay
 
07:08:26.690 --> 07:08:26.700 align:start position:0%
representative of South King seconds uh
 
07:08:28.010 --> 07:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
representative Leon do you want to speak
 
07:08:29.930 --> 07:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
to your motion um yes thank you Mr
 
07:08:33.350 --> 07:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
chairman uh looking into this bill it's
 
07:08:36.410 --> 07:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
it's clear that what we found out that
 
07:08:39.708 --> 07:08:39.718 align:start position:0%
the section that this refers to has
 
07:08:42.650 --> 07:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
never been stood out it's not funded so
 
07:08:44.270 --> 07:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
it would require
 
07:08:47.810 --> 07:08:47.820 align:start position:0%
creating a whole new board and a whole
 
07:08:49.610 --> 07:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
new requirement there would be a lot of
 
07:08:51.708 --> 07:08:51.718 align:start position:0%
work a lot of money to try and make that
 
07:08:54.350 --> 07:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
happen this is something where there's
 
07:08:56.510 --> 07:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
other issues as well around it with
 
07:08:57.948 --> 07:08:57.958 align:start position:0%
making sure that
 
07:09:00.830 --> 07:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh the I there's no generic insulin and
 
07:09:02.628 --> 07:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
if there was still generic insulin that
 
07:09:04.128 --> 07:09:04.138 align:start position:0%
might be an easy change but we need to
 
07:09:05.570 --> 07:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
look at all the different insulin types
 
07:09:08.390 --> 07:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
this would be a very large very big
 
07:09:10.670 --> 07:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
change in order to get the sponsor's
 
07:09:10.680 --> 07:09:11.990 align:start position:0%
change in order to get the sponsor's
intent

07:09:11.990 --> 07:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
intent
 
07:09:14.208 --> 07:09:14.218 align:start position:0%
um to actually come to fruition so by
 
07:09:16.490 --> 07:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
itl in this bill it would need to come
 
07:09:19.010 --> 07:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
back and substantially changed form so
 
07:09:20.208 --> 07:09:20.218 align:start position:0%
there should not be a problem with it
 
07:09:22.250 --> 07:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
coming back in the second year of this
 
07:09:24.708 --> 07:09:24.718 align:start position:0%
session additionally I listened to the
 
07:09:26.890 --> 07:09:26.900 align:start position:0%
State of the Union Address and 35
 
07:09:30.830 --> 07:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
insulin co-pays is a priority out of DC
 
07:09:34.788 --> 07:09:34.798 align:start position:0%
so trying to recreate and stand up a
 
07:09:36.468 --> 07:09:36.478 align:start position:0%
program that doesn't exist and isn't
 
07:09:38.690 --> 07:09:38.700 align:start position:0%
funded when there is a federal effort to
 
07:09:41.030 --> 07:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
do this and we would need to rewrite the
 
07:09:42.708 --> 07:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
bill just doesn't seem like it's the
 
07:09:44.390 --> 07:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
most appropriate use of committee time
 
07:09:46.128 --> 07:09:46.138 align:start position:0%
given everything else that we're trying
 
07:09:47.930 --> 07:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
to handle this year and this coming
 
07:09:50.690 --> 07:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
summer and fall therefore since we would
 
07:09:52.548 --> 07:09:52.558 align:start position:0%
be able to change things up and and
 
07:09:53.990 --> 07:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
somebody could introduce a different
 
07:09:57.170 --> 07:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
Bill to achieve this aim for next year
 
07:09:58.910 --> 07:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
within this term I believe that
 
07:10:01.610 --> 07:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate is the the most
 
07:10:03.830 --> 07:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate given time constraints
 
07:10:06.830 --> 07:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
07:10:08.628 --> 07:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I will say
 
07:10:12.350 --> 07:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
regretfully that I I agree that this
 
07:10:12.360 --> 07:10:13.310 align:start position:0%
regretfully that I I agree that this
bill

07:10:13.310 --> 07:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:10:15.708 --> 07:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
and this program is not workable
 
07:10:18.230 --> 07:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
although the intent of the bill is very
 
07:10:18.240 --> 07:10:19.490 align:start position:0%
although the intent of the bill is very
admirable

07:10:19.490 --> 07:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
admirable
 
07:10:23.330 --> 07:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
and I'm very glad that we have the
 
07:10:26.030 --> 07:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity now with cameras to say on
 
07:10:27.850 --> 07:10:27.860 align:start position:0%
the record that
 
07:10:32.330 --> 07:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
if this bill is itl'd we are only it
 
07:10:32.340 --> 07:10:33.490 align:start position:0%
if this bill is itl'd we are only it
yelling

07:10:33.490 --> 07:10:33.500 align:start position:0%
yelling
 
07:10:37.430 --> 07:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
the use of a very problematical vehicle
 
07:10:40.330 --> 07:10:40.340 align:start position:0%
and not precluding the entire
 
07:10:43.128 --> 07:10:43.138 align:start position:0%
spectrum of things we might be doing for
 
07:10:45.770 --> 07:10:45.780 align:start position:0%
people who need a insulin to make it
 
07:10:48.410 --> 07:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
more available and more affordable that
 
07:10:50.468 --> 07:10:50.478 align:start position:0%
we're just restricting this one program
 
07:10:53.150 --> 07:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
so with that having been said in that
 
07:10:58.208 --> 07:10:58.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:02.390 --> 07:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
realistically going to vote for itl
 
07:11:05.150 --> 07:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
of the discussion yes representative
 
07:11:05.160 --> 07:11:06.770 align:start position:0%
of the discussion yes representative
farmer

07:11:06.770 --> 07:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
farmer
 
07:11:09.190 --> 07:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I think
 
07:11:11.208 --> 07:11:11.218 align:start position:0%
representative Weber has sort of
 
07:11:14.810 --> 07:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
addressed my concern which is that what
 
07:11:16.788 --> 07:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
I've heard before is that if a bill is
 
07:11:19.310 --> 07:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
itl that you can't bring up the the
 
07:11:19.320 --> 07:11:21.230 align:start position:0%
itl that you can't bring up the the
overall

07:11:21.230 --> 07:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
overall
 
07:11:25.128 --> 07:11:25.138 align:start position:0%
issue again easily but if this can come
 
07:11:28.310 --> 07:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
up particularly in the if if there is we
 
07:11:30.468 --> 07:11:30.478 align:start position:0%
hear that there's Federal changes that
 
07:11:32.750 --> 07:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
would make it easy for us to enact
 
07:11:34.910 --> 07:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
something in New Hampshire then yeah
 
07:11:37.368 --> 07:11:37.378 align:start position:0%
then that makes sense to me
 
07:11:39.890 --> 07:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you of the discussion yes
 
07:11:42.350 --> 07:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you this is a
 
07:11:44.270 --> 07:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
little bit of a tongue-in-cheek thing
 
07:11:45.890 --> 07:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
but I did not watch the State of the
 
07:11:47.150 --> 07:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
Union Address
 
07:11:49.430 --> 07:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
um when that point was brought up did
 
07:11:52.628 --> 07:11:52.638 align:start position:0%
both sides cheer or did just one side
 
07:11:55.190 --> 07:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
I I didn't watch it either so I don't
 
07:11:57.170 --> 07:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
know I wasn't watching that carefully
 
07:11:59.510 --> 07:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
for it I just noted oh this is what
 
07:12:00.708 --> 07:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do in New Hampshire
 
07:12:02.448 --> 07:12:02.458 align:start position:0%
maybe they're going to look at it
 
07:12:02.458 --> 07:12:05.150 align:start position:0%
maybe they're going to look at it
federally

07:12:05.150 --> 07:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:08.750 --> 07:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:10.368 --> 07:12:10.378 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
07:12:14.270 --> 07:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
um I I understand and
 
07:12:17.150 --> 07:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
um regretfully agree that this bill has
 
07:12:19.850 --> 07:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
brought to us is really flawed and is
 
07:12:22.430 --> 07:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
problematic and among other things it
 
07:12:24.410 --> 07:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any
 
07:12:26.570 --> 07:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
um Financial note about who's going to
 
07:12:27.830 --> 07:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
pay for this and how it's going to be
 
07:12:31.430 --> 07:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
paid for still in principle I
 
07:12:33.410 --> 07:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
I would have a tremendous amount of
 
07:12:36.590 --> 07:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
difficulty voting to itl so I won't vote
 
07:12:38.570 --> 07:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
to itl and I would hope that it could be
 
07:12:41.570 --> 07:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
retained I think I noticed also that
 
07:12:43.670 --> 07:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
during the State of the Union speech
 
07:12:47.868 --> 07:12:47.878 align:start position:0%
that that was proposed by the president
 
07:12:50.468 --> 07:12:50.478 align:start position:0%
um but clearly the State of the Union
 
07:12:53.570 --> 07:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
speech is a place where a lot of ideas
 
07:12:56.990 --> 07:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
are proposed and they don't necessarily
 
07:12:58.368 --> 07:12:58.378 align:start position:0%
come to fruition
 
07:13:00.708 --> 07:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
I hope it does then we can
 
07:13:00.718 --> 07:13:01.788 align:start position:0%
I hope it does then we can
just

07:13:01.788 --> 07:13:01.798 align:start position:0%
just
 
07:13:04.430 --> 07:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
end this bill
 
07:13:07.548 --> 07:13:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:09.230 --> 07:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
07:13:14.690 --> 07:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
the roll motion is itl on HB 338 FM

representative Cannon
 
07:13:50.160 --> 07:13:52.548 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon
yes

07:13:52.548 --> 07:13:52.558 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:13:57.070 --> 07:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:59.930 --> 07:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
07:13:59.940 --> 07:14:02.350 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
no

07:14:02.350 --> 07:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:14:07.070 --> 07:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:10.910 --> 07:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy yes
 
07:14:12.708 --> 07:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
07:14:12.718 --> 07:14:15.288 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
yes

07:14:15.288 --> 07:14:15.298 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:14:19.850 --> 07:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:24.350 --> 07:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:27.128 --> 07:14:27.138 align:start position:0%
I have 16 to four
 
07:14:30.048 --> 07:14:30.058 align:start position:0%
16-4 itl
 
07:14:31.910 --> 07:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay do we know if there's going to be a
 
07:14:34.788 --> 07:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
minority report at this point or
 
07:14:38.930 --> 07:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:43.010 --> 07:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
that looks like no no Minority Report
 
07:14:44.868 --> 07:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
um but it would have to go I believe on
 
07:14:46.968 --> 07:14:46.978 align:start position:0%
the regular calendar with four with four
 
07:14:49.610 --> 07:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
no votes okay
 
07:14:52.628 --> 07:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
right two is the limit right I believe
 
07:14:55.548 --> 07:14:55.558 align:start position:0%
two is the limit if it's it can't be
 
07:14:57.230 --> 07:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
more than two if it goes on consent
 
07:14:59.990 --> 07:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
under the speakers that I worked on it
 
07:15:02.448 --> 07:15:02.458 align:start position:0%
was two it's a speaker's policy I have
 
07:15:05.030 --> 07:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
seen as many as four but I don't think
 
07:15:05.040 --> 07:15:05.990 align:start position:0%
seen as many as four but I don't think
that's

07:15:05.990 --> 07:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's
 
07:15:07.670 --> 07:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
really sensible I mean we have a
 
07:15:09.948 --> 07:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
significant difference of opinion about
 
07:15:12.650 --> 07:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
the ultimate way to deal with the bill
 
07:15:15.170 --> 07:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
so okay all right thank you
 
07:15:17.810 --> 07:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
all right uh next for our consideration
 
07:15:20.868 --> 07:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
House Bill 262 relative to library
 
07:15:23.090 --> 07:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
Laboratory Testing by licensed
 
07:15:25.910 --> 07:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
naturopaths do I have a motion yes
 
07:15:28.368 --> 07:15:28.378 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
07:15:31.128 --> 07:15:31.138 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I move that we recommend
 
07:15:33.350 --> 07:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 262
 
07:15:35.330 --> 07:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
07:15:37.730 --> 07:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
okay to pass is there a second to that
 
07:15:37.740 --> 07:15:39.048 align:start position:0%
okay to pass is there a second to that
second

07:15:39.048 --> 07:15:39.058 align:start position:0%
second
 
07:15:42.048 --> 07:15:42.058 align:start position:0%
uh representative Merchant seconds
 
07:15:43.850 --> 07:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
uh representative Cushman do you want to
 
07:15:47.150 --> 07:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes thank you
 
07:15:48.948 --> 07:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
um there was some confusion during the
 
07:15:50.930 --> 07:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
hearing I think on the
 
07:15:53.448 --> 07:15:53.458 align:start position:0%
um on the reasoning and and what this
 
07:15:54.830 --> 07:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
bill does
 
07:15:57.110 --> 07:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
um but I hope that it was clarified that
 
07:15:59.150 --> 07:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
this is really a technical change I
 
07:16:01.730 --> 07:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
think it's it's just it's kind of like
 
07:16:04.430 --> 07:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
being polite to just include the
 
07:16:04.440 --> 07:16:06.048 align:start position:0%
being polite to just include the
naturopathic

07:16:06.048 --> 07:16:06.058 align:start position:0%
naturopathic
 
07:16:06.058 --> 07:16:06.770 align:start position:0%
naturopathic
um

07:16:06.770 --> 07:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:16:11.208 --> 07:16:11.218 align:start position:0%
doctors in this this lab testing
 
07:16:13.548 --> 07:16:13.558 align:start position:0%
um statute it doesn't change anything
 
07:16:15.548 --> 07:16:15.558 align:start position:0%
that they're able to do
 
07:16:18.048 --> 07:16:18.058 align:start position:0%
besides clarifying
 
07:16:20.270 --> 07:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
that along with all the other medical
 
07:16:23.690 --> 07:16:23.700 align:start position:0%
practitioners they don't have a duty to
 
07:16:25.850 --> 07:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
care for someone who brings them Labs
 
07:16:27.830 --> 07:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
that they ordered themselves
 
07:16:30.350 --> 07:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
I think that's the only real
 
07:16:33.530 --> 07:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
impact of the bill it just clarifies
 
07:16:34.850 --> 07:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
so I hope you'll all support the
 
07:16:34.860 --> 07:16:36.468 align:start position:0%
so I hope you'll all support the
autopaths

07:16:36.468 --> 07:16:36.478 align:start position:0%
autopaths
 
07:16:36.478 --> 07:16:38.150 align:start position:0%
autopaths
discussion

07:16:38.150 --> 07:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
07:16:40.910 --> 07:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative Weber
 
07:16:44.030 --> 07:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
well I started out as a solid itl on
 
07:16:46.690 --> 07:16:46.700 align:start position:0%
this one but having looked at
 
07:16:49.490 --> 07:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
what already exists
 
07:16:52.070 --> 07:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
it does seem that we have
 
07:16:52.080 --> 07:16:54.530 align:start position:0%
it does seem that we have
a

07:16:54.530 --> 07:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:16:57.650 --> 07:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
real glitch between the issues of
 
07:16:59.750 --> 07:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
reporting and interpreting and who does
 
07:17:05.390 --> 07:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
it and maintaining that given that the
 
07:17:07.490 --> 07:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
practice is already allowed
 
07:17:10.670 --> 07:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
seems like removing removing that
 
07:17:12.288 --> 07:17:12.298 align:start position:0%
problem is a good idea so I'm going to
 
07:17:13.750 --> 07:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of the ought to pass
 
07:17:16.190 --> 07:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
07:17:17.868 --> 07:17:17.878 align:start position:0%
um for my following comments I'm going
 
07:17:19.490 --> 07:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
to be kicked out of the medical society
 
07:17:21.650 --> 07:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to make them anyways um we
 
07:17:24.110 --> 07:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
won't tell them thanks I mean in terms
 
07:17:25.910 --> 07:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
of scope of practice I have serious
 
07:17:28.070 --> 07:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
problems but it exists and I brought
 
07:17:29.628 --> 07:17:29.638 align:start position:0%
this up at all of our discussions on
 
07:17:31.670 --> 07:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
this it already exists in scope of
 
07:17:33.170 --> 07:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
practice that they are allowed to order
 
07:17:35.990 --> 07:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
and interpret these tests and I think
 
07:17:38.750 --> 07:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's impossible to not acknowledge that
 
07:17:40.910 --> 07:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
and vote against that
 
07:17:43.850 --> 07:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
and representative Merchant
 
07:17:46.850 --> 07:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
what I initially was looking to not
 
07:17:48.468 --> 07:17:48.478 align:start position:0%
support it but then when I went back and
 
07:17:50.150 --> 07:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
looked at it
 
07:17:51.948 --> 07:17:51.958 align:start position:0%
the naturopath can actually order
 
07:17:53.810 --> 07:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
interpret their own Labs but they only
 
07:17:55.670 --> 07:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
can interpret the labs they order
 
07:17:57.288 --> 07:17:57.298 align:start position:0%
so if a patient wants to bring something
 
07:17:59.150 --> 07:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
to the naturopath that they didn't order
 
07:18:01.610 --> 07:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
they can't interpret it so all this does
 
07:18:03.890 --> 07:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
is allow the natural path the ability to
 
07:18:05.690 --> 07:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
interpret an order brought to them by a
 
07:18:07.310 --> 07:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
patient or bought to them by another
 
07:18:09.310 --> 07:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
provider so I think it's kind of
 
07:18:11.628 --> 07:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
extension logically to say if you can
 
07:18:14.990 --> 07:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
interpret your orders that you order but
 
07:18:16.670 --> 07:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
you can't interpret someone else's lab
 
07:18:18.948 --> 07:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
that's kind of doesn't make any sense to
 
07:18:18.958 --> 07:18:21.288 align:start position:0%
that's kind of doesn't make any sense to
me

07:18:21.288 --> 07:18:21.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:24.830 --> 07:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro yes I'm I'm going
 
07:18:27.590 --> 07:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
to vote for this and I think that um not
 
07:18:30.230 --> 07:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
only does it change nothing or very
 
07:18:32.750 --> 07:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
little as representative Merchant said
 
07:18:34.730 --> 07:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
but I think you know it's an opportunity
 
07:18:37.548 --> 07:18:37.558 align:start position:0%
just for us to vote for people to have
 
07:18:39.948 --> 07:18:39.958 align:start position:0%
the most diverse choices in terms of
 
07:18:41.990 --> 07:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
making their own medical opinions
 
07:18:44.270 --> 07:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
without hurting anybody
 
07:18:46.490 --> 07:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
07:18:48.890 --> 07:18:48.900 align:start position:0%
chairman I I also was in the same boat
 
07:18:51.410 --> 07:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
initially to itl right from the get-go
 
07:18:53.570 --> 07:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
but the testimony we heard yesterday
 
07:18:56.570 --> 07:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
specifically from Dr Lou was one that
 
07:18:59.570 --> 07:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
really I thought attacked more of their
 
07:19:01.250 --> 07:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
historical background the standard of
 
07:19:03.890 --> 07:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
care their training that's not the scope
 
07:19:05.510 --> 07:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
of this bill this the scope of this bill
 
07:19:06.948 --> 07:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
as everybody else has mentioned is
 
07:19:09.110 --> 07:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
basically allowing them to do what they
 
07:19:11.628 --> 07:19:11.638 align:start position:0%
already do and it was a technical era a
 
07:19:13.430 --> 07:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
year ago not to include them so I will
 
07:19:13.440 --> 07:19:14.208 align:start position:0%
year ago not to include them so I will
vote

07:19:14.208 --> 07:19:14.218 align:start position:0%
vote
 
07:19:15.368 --> 07:19:15.378 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
07:19:17.208 --> 07:19:17.218 align:start position:0%
as well
 
07:19:19.730 --> 07:19:19.740 align:start position:0%
thank you another discussion is
 
07:19:21.650 --> 07:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman I have one more
 
07:19:23.448 --> 07:19:23.458 align:start position:0%
piece of information to offer the
 
07:19:25.250 --> 07:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
committee although it seems we have good
 
07:19:25.260 --> 07:19:26.208 align:start position:0%
committee although it seems we have good
support

07:19:26.208 --> 07:19:26.218 align:start position:0%
support
 
07:19:28.190 --> 07:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
um I spoke with Courtney Tanner earlier
 
07:19:30.048 --> 07:19:30.058 align:start position:0%
because I think um from Dartmouth
 
07:19:32.448 --> 07:19:32.458 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock I think it was
 
07:19:35.090 --> 07:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
um there was a little uh it was a little
 
07:19:36.708 --> 07:19:36.718 align:start position:0%
unclear if Dartmouth Hitchcock was
 
07:19:39.350 --> 07:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to it because Dr Liu works there
 
07:19:41.690 --> 07:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
but Dartmouth Hitchcock is not opposed
 
07:19:43.788 --> 07:19:43.798 align:start position:0%
they're neutral on the bill thank you

yes and actually Dr Lou himself said
 
07:19:52.010 --> 07:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
that he was neutral on the bill and I
 
07:19:53.930 --> 07:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
think the concerns I had had to do with
 
07:19:55.788 --> 07:19:55.798 align:start position:0%
finances which has actually nothing to
 
07:19:57.650 --> 07:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
do with this bill and would have to be
 
07:19:59.990 --> 07:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
addressed elsewhere so I'm in favor of
 
07:20:00.000 --> 07:20:01.010 align:start position:0%
