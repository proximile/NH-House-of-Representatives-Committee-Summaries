police and it was because of uh usually
 
00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
when something comes before you
 
00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 align:start position:0%
uh for a change in law it's because
 
00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
something happened and that's correct
 
00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
i happened to be
 
00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:17.749 align:start position:0%
i happened to be
working

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
on the road one day with a couple other
 
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
troopers and
 
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
we had a driver from
 
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
vermont driving a commercial motor
 
00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle who had a restriction on his
 
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
license from the state of vermont
 
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
for our ignition interlock device
 
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
however the commercial vehicle he was
 
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
operating did not have one
 
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.629 align:start position:0%
operating did not have one
and

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
going through what the current law was
 
00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
both state law and federal motor carrier
 
00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.469 align:start position:0%
both state law and federal motor carrier
regulation

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
the only thing that we could
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
actually cite this guy for was for
 
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
disobeying the terms of his license
 
00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 align:start position:0%
restrictions on another state which
 
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
obviously is an issue
 
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.030 align:start position:0%
obviously is an issue
so

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
this will
 
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
sure up
 
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.070 align:start position:0%
sure up
um

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
the law so that it applies equally to
 
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.990 align:start position:0%
the law so that it applies equally to
everybody

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.870 align:start position:0%
everybody
and

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
will give us another tool in our toolbox
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
commercial motor vehicle drivers that
 
00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:11.590 align:start position:0%
commercial motor vehicle drivers that
are

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 align:start position:0%

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.550 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking this
question

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.350 align:start position:0%
question
uh

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
in a case like that where you find
 
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
somebody with a license that is noted to
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
be interlocked required or however
 
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
do you
 
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
then notify eventually through paperwork
 
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
the state from which they came
 
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes as a matter of fact we did we were
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
able to get a hold of vermont
 
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.029 align:start position:0%
able to get a hold of vermont
once

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
once
 
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
the individual was convicted that
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
information went to vermont they did
 
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
take action further action against him
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
um on his license but yes
 
00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
we had a conversation roadside with one
 
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
of the dmv
 
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
directors over in vermont trying to work
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
through this problem however
 
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
that was the only thing that we could do
 
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
with the time so this this will um
 
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative burr
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%

how many cases
 
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
where somebody has a dwi in any state
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
for a motor vehicle but then their cdl
 
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know they're driving a cdl vehicle
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
how many
 
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
cases where the person was
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
under the influence driving a cdl
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
that i don't have the data on that i'm
 
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.110 align:start position:0%
that i don't have the data on that i'm
sorry

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um because where
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going with this is you know yes
 
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.510 align:start position:0%
i'm going with this is you know yes
his

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
license was suspended or
 
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh for his
 
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle but this is a federal
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
you know cdl is federal
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
so how can we
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know make this law that's going you
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
know to a federal
 
00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:09.909 align:start position:0%
know to a federal
license

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.270 align:start position:0%
so um
obviously

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
this will be a disqualifying
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
disqualifies the driver from operating
 
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.390 align:start position:0%
disqualifies the driver from operating
and

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
there is both state and federal
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
regulation obviously that prohibit
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
somebody from driving
 
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
while they're disqualified
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
so we would cite them under the state
 
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
law however it also
 
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
at the same time is
 
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
federally noted goes under the federal
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
database uh said this database
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
um even if somebody from another state
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
runs this particular individual's
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
driving license
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
one they can see the restriction on it
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
and two
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
as far as driving a commercial vehicle
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
if they have been stopped and inspected
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
anytime prior within the
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
first within the last 10 years we're
 
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
able to get that information roadside as
 
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
well so we can see their whole
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
history whether it be
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
state violation alone or
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
federal violations um
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
we have access to that so we would be
 
00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
able to better
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
identify anybody that's that's driving a
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
violation of this or for any um
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
violation for that matter
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
in one last follow-up mr chairman uh
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%

uh
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
well i guess
 
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
you know that answered it some but you
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
know i go back to that this is a federal
 
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.709 align:start position:0%
know i go back to that this is a federal
license

00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
controlled by the feds
 
00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
so why are we making laws
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
in conjunction
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
you know you know do we have the
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
authority i guess is the real question
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
yes yes we do so
 
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.310 align:start position:0%
yes yes we do so
um

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
the the feds
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
it's based on your home state's license
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
so for example the example i gave you
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
vermont was the one that
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
initiated the action against this driver
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
for an
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
ignition interlock because of a dwi
 
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.670 align:start position:0%
ignition interlock because of a dwi
conviction

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
conviction
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
that information is shared
 
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
with the feds
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
they then
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
put in their database that this guy is
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
disqualified for these whatever the
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
reasons are
 
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.509 align:start position:0%
reasons are
and

00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:31.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
there is a federal
 
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.070 align:start position:0%
there is a federal
federal

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
regulation violation for
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
driving and
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
and via in
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
violation of the restrictions that your
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
home state put on your license but
 
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.389 align:start position:0%
home state put on your license but
um

00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
the federal side of this will only take
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
action once there's action taken by your
 
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.590 align:start position:0%
action once there's action taken by your
license

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
home state i guess is the best way to
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
put it what are wherever you're licensed
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
out of
 
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.710 align:start position:0%
out of
um

00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
that state needs to take the action
 
00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:02.839 align:start position:0%
against you before the
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
um federal side of this will kick in
 
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.030 align:start position:0%
um federal side of this will kick in
so

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
state violation
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
issued by the state
 
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
once a conviction is
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
made or once the person has been kicked
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
convicted of it that goes into the
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
federal database
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's when it becomes available to
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
all everybody
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
and at that point
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
if somebody was caught in violation like
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
this particular driver was
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
there's a federal violation as well as a
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
state violation so this is the state
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
violation here that we're talking about
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
once that action is
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
has gone through the
 
00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
court hearing
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
process they're convicted it then hits
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
the register
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
on on the federal side hope that answers
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
your question thank you
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
actually i just have a
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
if you could clarify um for the members
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
there's no um
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
there's no federal d.o.t police out
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
there that are doing it it's up to the
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
states to is could you explain that just
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit so the members understand
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
that it works um
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
so as far as as the federal regulations
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
go there are a set of federal
 
00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:15.590 align:start position:0%
go there are a set of federal
regulations

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
for commercial vehicle operation
 
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.150 align:start position:0%
for commercial vehicle operation
and

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
there as the chairman just said there is
 
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.350 align:start position:0%
there as the chairman just said there is
no

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
federal police if you were
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
that go out and force this there are
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
members in every state and territory
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
that have people that have been trained
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
and certified to enforce these federal
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
motor carrier regulations so we're
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
here in the state of new hampshire it's
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state police
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
troop g to be exact and there's 35
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
members that are proper that are um
 
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
trained and certified by the federal
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
government to go out and conduct
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
commercial motor vehicle and
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement um
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
so no federal
 
00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.670 align:start position:0%
so no federal
police

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
if you want to call it that it's all up
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
to the states and the territories to to
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
enforce it
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification uh
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
representative true please thank you mr
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:11.110 align:start position:0%
 
if

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
i i thought the uh when you had a cdl
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
you know the state license was tied to
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
the cdo
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
if you lose if you lose your state
 
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.150 align:start position:0%
if you lose if you lose your state
license

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
or whatever please you don't lose your
 
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
cdl you do and that's something that
 
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:27.990 align:start position:0%
cdl you do and that's something that
was

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
yes your cdl is issued by your state
 
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.269 align:start position:0%
yes your cdl is issued by your state
and

00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
if you if
 
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
if your home state takes action against
 
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:41.990 align:start position:0%
if your home state takes action against
you

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.269 align:start position:0%
you
um

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's almost immediate whatever the
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
action is if you get it for example if
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
you get a ticket in california
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
eventually that information will make it
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
back to new hampshire it will go on your
 
00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
driver's license so yes any anything any
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
violation or any citation or any
 
00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:04.389 align:start position:0%
violation or any citation or any
conviction

00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
conviction
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
eventually will show up on your license
 
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.509 align:start position:0%
eventually will show up on your license
however

00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
if it's from an outside state sometimes
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
it does take longer for that to happen
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.269 align:start position:0%
 
follow

00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
so so in up case when in the march
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
the uh the operator
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
would require that interlock device that
 
00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:28.389 align:start position:0%
would require that interlock device that
doesn't

00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't carry over to you
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
it does the issue that we that came up
 
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:34.470 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.670 align:start position:0%
was that
[Music]

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
we had no state law
 
00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.910 align:start position:0%
we had no state law
that

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
allowed us to take
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
an appropriate action against this
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
individual we had to cite them for
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
disobeying the terms of their
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions on the license which is a
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
62 ticket here in new hampshire
 
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.550 align:start position:0%
62 ticket here in new hampshire
this

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
would allow us to charge this individual
 
00:13:57.199 --> 00:13:58.470 align:start position:0%
would allow us to charge this individual
with

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
violation of not having the interlock
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
device installed on the vehicle he was
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
driving which is a far more serious
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
offense which carries a
 
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
far more significant penalty
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
so if i could clarify
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
similar situation would be if i was
 
00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.990 align:start position:0%
similar situation would be if i was
driving

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
driving
 
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
if i had a vermont license that said
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
corrective lenses and i was driving in
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire without my corrective
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
lenses you would be able to cite me for
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
driving outside the restrictions of my
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
license but
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
not in this case the more serious
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
offense of not having the interlock that
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's correct and we've had two
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
instances that i know of in the last
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
three years where we've stopped
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
a commercial vehicle
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
and an interlock device was required
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
but was not installed so this
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's not just one insulated ice incident
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
this is the one that drove us to be here
 
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.910 align:start position:0%
this is the one that drove us to be here
today

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
but there have been other instances of
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
this happening and again it's not
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
a common occurrence however it is a
 
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.710 align:start position:0%
a common occurrence however it is a
significant

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
offense it's a serious offense
 
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.829 align:start position:0%
offense it's a serious offense
and

00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
we need the ability to cite the
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
individual for
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
the serious events and basically we
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
would be citing them and they would be
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
subject to the same penalties here in
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire as if in this instance the
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
gentleman from vermont so it's
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
letting us enforce the
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
the same law the same way
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
so in other words you would be treating
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
any out-of-state driver the same way
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
you'd be treating a new hampshire driver
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
if they did not have their interlock
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
device correct absolutely yes okay thank
 
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.350 align:start position:0%
device correct absolutely yes okay thank
you

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh what what is the state police
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
definition of a commercial vehicle
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
because you see
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
big vehicles that people rent that don't
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
require a special license to drive them
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
i just wondered how you what you define
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
as a commercial vehicle for the purposes
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
so for the purposes of this
 
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.990 align:start position:0%
so for the purposes of this
um

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:10.710 align:start position:0%
it is
the

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
definition commercial vehicle it's a
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
something used in commerce obviously
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
that has a gross vehicle weight rating
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
or a combination
 
00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:20.870 align:start position:0%
or a combination
vehicle

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
weight rating greater than ten thousand
 
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.189 align:start position:0%
weight rating greater than ten thousand
pounds

00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily require a cdl that's
 
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
greater than twenty six thousand pounds
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
but in this instance uh we're looking at
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
the broader definition or the federal
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
definition i i should say of commercial
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle was
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
anything greater than ten thousand one
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
pounds used in the furtherance of a
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
representative muse oh hold on a second
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
represent a new one you had to follow up
 
00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:50.870 align:start position:0%
represent a new one you had to follow up
so

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
can a civilian
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
driver that doesn't need a cdl rent a
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle that fits that those that
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
description and would they then be
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
subject to this law no um
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
the the the big difference with any of
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
these definitions um
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
is if they're used in the in the
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
furtherance of a commercial enterprise
 
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.549 align:start position:0%
furtherance of a commercial enterprise
so

00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
technically you could go rent a tractor
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
trailer an 18-wheeler to move furniture
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
from one side of the country to the
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
other and drive it on an operator's
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
license it's the in-commerce that
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
kicks all the stuff in
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question i am
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
blessedly not too familiar with
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
interlocked devices uh but it does
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
strike me that their a situation with a
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
commercial driver might be one that
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
their personal vehicle
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
has an interlock device and maybe their
 
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
and their commercial vehicle uh does not
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
are these devices portable so if i'm
 
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
required to
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
to have one
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
can i transfer them from vehicle to
 
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.190 align:start position:0%
can i transfer them from vehicle to
vehicle

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
i am not aware
 
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
if they
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
if somebody was going to answer that
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll be more than happy to
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
answer that question as a um
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
a former agent of the commonwealth of
 
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
massachusetts court system for the
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
purpose of calibrating installing and
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
maintaining breathalyzer interlock
 
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
devices it is not perm it is not
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
portable and is not designed to be
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
portable it is permanently fixed into
 
00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
the motor vehicle and shall be inspected
 
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
on a 30-day basis to make sure it hasn't
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
been tampered with
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
and i do believe this is a cleanup bill
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh because i assure you that all
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
probationers other words people that
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
have these devices ordered by a court in
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
their motor vehicles are very much aware
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
of what their requirements are to do
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
that they shall not operate any motor
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle without the interlock device
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
they know this they've signed off on it
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
at least a half a dozen times through
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
their agreements with the courts
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
and the people and organizations that
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
provide the equipment so this bill and
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong would simply
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
provide us some recourse against
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
individuals that may be employed as a
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
commercial driver
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
and the rigs that they operate may not
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
have this they know that they have to
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
have this equipment in their in whatever
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
that whatever vehicle they're operating
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
even a motor vessel
 
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.870 align:start position:0%
even a motor vessel
so

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
this just allows us to keep our roads
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
safe for people that are being bad
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
actors and trying to circumvent the
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
system onto technicality would that be
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
an uh accurate assessment
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
yes it would thank you very much thank
 
00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:23.590 align:start position:0%
yes it would thank you very much thank
you

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.710 align:start position:0%
yeah so
essentially

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.390 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
i'm

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.590 align:start position:0%
i'm
i'm

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
also curious about is is a situation um
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
i guess how common it is for a
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicle driver
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
to actually have an employer who would
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
install one of these things so
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
it seems like there would be a direct
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
connection between
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
a requirement to have a device like this
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
in any vehicle you operate
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
and your ability to work if that's what
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
and i was surprised
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
probably six or eight months ago i
 
00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:08.799 align:start position:0%
received a call in the office um
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
from a trucking company
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
looking for the list of providers
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
because they were hiring a cdl driver
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
that required an interlock device and um
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
i had a pretty candid conversation with
 
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
with the individual
 
00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.430 align:start position:0%
with the individual
[Music]

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
from a law enforcement
 
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.149 align:start position:0%
from a law enforcement
perspective

00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
employing a cdl driver
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
that required an interlock device
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
obviously means that that person has
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
some significant history
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
bad driving history
 
00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.110 align:start position:0%
bad driving history
and

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
i think of
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
the amount of insurance that's required
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
on a commercial vehicle to begin with
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
and when
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
you're unemployed
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
you're employed by a commercial driver
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
as a commercial driver
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
all that information is relayed to your
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
insurance company and that's how they
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
base some of their premiums is based on
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
type of vehicle amount of miles driven
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
and the driving record of your employees
 
00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
i can only imagine
 
00:21:11.679 --> 00:21:12.549 align:start position:0%
i can only imagine
the

00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
added cost
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
on to your insurance policy to try to
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
employ somebody that's got
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
at least one if not two or more dwi
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
convictions or another serious offense
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
on their record um
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason the this particular
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
individual for this particular company
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
was a valued employee and they were
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
there to support him i don't know that
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
that would be the case for for most
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
as you know we're in a nationwide
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
shortage for cdl drivers
 
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.909 align:start position:0%
shortage for cdl drivers
and

00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
we still have a responsibility to make
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
sure that the people that are driving
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
these larger vehicles
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
are responsible and obeying the law
 
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.710 align:start position:0%
are responsible and obeying the law
and

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
they do put them in commercial vehicles
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
we've seen them before i i i think it's
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
a huge expense
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
on the company's part but if they're
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
willing to do it to support one of their
 
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.510 align:start position:0%
willing to do it to support one of their
employees

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
you know we're there to make sure that
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
they have the information available to
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
them i think a lot of us have a question
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
as to does
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
does this not disqualify you from a cdl
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
license at the federal level i mean
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
yes um there are a number of
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
stipulations that go along with a
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
conviction for dwi for example in new
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire if you're driving your car
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
snowmobile boat motorcycle and get
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
convicted of dwi first offense
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
court will suspend your license for 60
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
days depending uh six
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
180 days
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
if you do certain steps you can get it
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
back in 90 days if you're a cdl holder
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
regardless as to what you were driving
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
again boat car snowmobile motorcycle
 
00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:56.950 align:start position:0%
again boat car snowmobile motorcycle
whatever

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
your cdl is gone for a year
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
that happens immediately
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
you can apply to get your
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
regular operator's license back if you
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
go through the steps but you can't do
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
that with your cdl it's a minimum year
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
so there are a list of
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
um major infractions if you will
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
in the federal regulations you know
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
first offense dwi it's a year second
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
offense it can be three to five years um
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
or even a second offense dwi can be a
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
lifetime banned from
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
obtaining a cdl so there are significant
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
penalties even though
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
you're not operating a commercial
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
vehicle at the time that you committed
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
the violation however just because you
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
have the ability or you have a cdl there
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
is an enhanced penalty just because you
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
you hold that license
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
so the the person you're talking about
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
the vermont person he would have been
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
after that one year automatic
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
and then he was able to do the cdl with
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
the interlock device
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
that's correct their their law allows it
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
represent wallace thank you mr chairman
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
and just uh for members know that
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
commercial people that have commercial
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses actually have a lower
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
threshold for
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh being convicted of an oui like us
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
commercial pilots i don't know exactly
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
what it is but i believe it's
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
0.08 for a cdl
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
so for a regular operator
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
driving a non-commercial vehicle it's
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
.08 for somebody driving
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
a commercial license that requires a cdl
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
is .04 so it's half
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
that's only if you're driving something
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
even though you have a cdl again if you
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
got caught in your car pickup truck
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
motorcycle whatever the limit would be
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
.08 however there again there is the
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
enhanced penalty once you're convicted
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
of of it with any other type of vehicle
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
there'd be no further questions we
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
appreciate the education thank you staff
 
00:25:09.919 --> 00:25:10.789 align:start position:0%
appreciate the education thank you staff
sergeant

00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
sergeant
 
00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much the committee now
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee my
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
name is brittany shu and i am the bureau
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
administrator of financial
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
responsibility this
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
legislation is at the request of the
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
department as sergeant huddleston has
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
informed you there are three pieces to
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
this legislation and i would like to
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
speak to all of them further
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
sergeant huddleston's testimony here but
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
also to bring attention to
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
part one of the proposed language
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
what this allows is the department of
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
safety to request a hearing on an
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
individual regardless of whether their
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
commercial driver and operator who are
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
convicted of a dwi out of state
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
so in the state of new hampshire if you
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
are convicted of a dwi you can be
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
ordered to have an ignition interlock
 
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.789 align:start position:0%
ordered to have an ignition interlock
device

00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
device
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
or you would go to a hearing with bureau
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
of hearings who would determine whether
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
you should be a
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
program participant for an ignition
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
interlock device
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
if you're a new hampshire person and you
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
violate out of state and you get
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
convicted of a dwi you are not subject
 
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.029 align:start position:0%
convicted of a dwi you are not subject
to

00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
the ignition interlock program
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
through this legislation we'll be able
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
to bring these individuals in determine
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
the details of their conviction was it a
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
first offense was it a subsequent and
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
should they be a program participant
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
right now we do not have that authority
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
so part one of this is applicable to
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
both commercial and non-commercial
 
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
drivers who receive a conviction for dwi
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
part two of this legislation
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
again to further
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
respond to your questions this provides
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
the authority for the department of
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
safety division of motor vehicles
 
00:26:54.559 --> 00:26:55.590 align:start position:0%
safety division of motor vehicles
director

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
to disqualify a commercial driver who
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
violates the ignition analog program
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
requirement so if they are operating a
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicle without an iid the
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
director does have authority
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
to disqualify the driver
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
we must disqualify a driver on a state
 
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.549 align:start position:0%
we must disqualify a driver on a state
level

00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
before it goes to the federal level so
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
the home state the state of record is
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for that disqualification
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
part three of this further defines a
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
serious traffic violation
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
which if a person is operating a vehicle
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
yes without an id is circumvention
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
so with this if a person
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
was charged with this within a two to
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
three year period they would have a
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
60-day disqualification it just further
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
strengthens our ability along with state
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
police and the roadside troopers to make
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
sure that our roads are more safe
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
with commercial motor vehicle drivers
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
out there
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
as a sergeant huddleston stated we have
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
a shortage it is anticipated that we get
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
more drivers into
 
00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
these vehicles they help get the country
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
moving they help get the deliveries out
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
there but while they're doing that we
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that should they have
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
an instance where they do drink and
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
drive they do lose their license they do
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
get disqualified and as part of
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation they are ordered as
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
participation in the iid program we want
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they truly are
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
doing everything that they should be
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
doing and that we are all safe and that
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
business is still moving with that i'll
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony because
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
it drew my attention back to article one
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
and so that is somebody who gets an
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
offense wherever
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
is then subject to going through a
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
program that would determine whether
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
they need an interlock device or not is
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
that a correct understanding of it thank
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
you for your question what this
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
legislation would do is to request a
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
hearing of that person convicted of a
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
dwi they would go before the bureau of
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
hearings to determine the facts and
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
details and if they are a person that
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
should be subjected to an ignition
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
interlock order
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
representative burke
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a two-part is you
 
00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.510 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a two-part is you
explained

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
explained
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
part one that we're going to enforce
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
other states laws here you know if
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
did the individual
 
00:29:27.279 --> 00:29:28.789 align:start position:0%
did the individual
face

00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
face
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
uh more punishment back when he got back
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
into vermont and then the part two is
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
how many states do this enforce other
 
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
state laws
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question in regards
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
to the enforcement of state laws new
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire is part of the driver
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
licensing compact so if you are
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
convicted of a dwi in another
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction new hampshire will treat it
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
as if the conviction occurred in new
 
00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.510 align:start position:0%
as if the conviction occurred in new
hampshire

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
so in regards to this vermont driver
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
they depend if he get a dwi within the
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
state of vermont and was subject to the
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
ignition interlock program in vermont
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
but was driving in new hampshire
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
i really can't speak to that because i
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if he was convicted in new
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire in new hampshire of a dwi
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
conviction we would apply applicable
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
state laws and then that home state
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
whether they choose to take um
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
reciprocal action under the driver
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
licensing compact would be up to their
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction i hope that answers your
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
question a follow-up
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you uh but so how many other
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
you know so does vermont enforce new
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire let's say the person gets
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
arrested here in new hampshire and he
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
goes over in
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
vermont and drives will does vermont
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
have this particular law to punish him
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
i do not have a specific answer but i
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
will be more than happy to research that
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
for you thank you
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
and i have a question just so you could
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
clarify it please
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
this isn't necessarily proposing that we
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
enforce other state laws it's proposing
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
recognize a conviction in another state
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
and apply our own laws to is that is
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
that proper understanding okay thank you
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
representative newman thank you this is
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up to my previous question
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure if you described this
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
example but it's
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
someone from out of state who had a dwi
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
in any jurisdiction and then gets
 
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.549 align:start position:0%
in any jurisdiction and then gets
stopped

00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
would they then become in new hampshire
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
would they then become subject to
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
hearing in new hampshire or what how
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
are you talking about a new hampshire
 
00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:32.630 align:start position:0%
are you talking about a new hampshire
driver

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
driver
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
it could be an out-of-state driver
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
i think i think a new hampshire driver
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
you would you would be subject to the
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
laws and it would automatically happen
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering how this law the way
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
it was written would affect
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
an out-of-state driver that had a dwi
 
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
and i don't know whether how they would
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
know that maybe they'd do it when they
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
run the license okay thank you for
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
claiming what would happen so
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
i will attempt to answer that so in the
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire if you're an
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
out-of-state driver and you are
 
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
convicted of dwi
 
00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.230 align:start position:0%
convicted of dwi
statutorily

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
statutorily
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
for the ignition interlock program it
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
has to be a subsequent so
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
in that case if you're statutorily
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
required for the dwi conviction as say a
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
massachusetts driver in new hampshire we
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
can order ignition interlocks for people
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
that reside in another jurisdiction who
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative true thank you mr chair
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
ma'am um
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
if this had happened
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
what this bill is addressing it happened
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
and and the person lost their license
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
their cdl license for at least a year
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
it would be the state of new hampshire
 
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
that would tell this person after a year
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
you can now activate your cdl
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
the home state is the only state that
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
this can disqualify a commercial driver
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
so a vermont driver that comes to new
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire as sergeant huddleston was
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
stating we can cite them for operating
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
outside of the ignition interlock what
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
we can't do is we cannot disqualify the
 
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
vermont driver what we can do is report
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
that information back to the home
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction who would then take action
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
in accordance with their laws what this
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
does here is this provides the authority
 
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire division of motor
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles to disqualify a new hampshire
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
commercial driver
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
for the operating a commercial motor
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle without an ignition interlock
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
when subject to an ignition interlock
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr g and thank you man
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%

to have an interlock device
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm driving a cdl vehicle without
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
the interlock
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
yes this provides me the authority to
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
disqualify you as a driver for
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
not complying with the ignition
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
interlock requirement
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%

00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
there'd be no
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your question if a
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
person is operating a commercial motor
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle as sergeant huddleston indicated
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
we would only be able to cite them for
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
the 62 violation of not obeying the
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
it's it's the notorious purple paint
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.480 --> 00:36:03.190 align:start position:0%
 
huh

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:15.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:28.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to open up the executive
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
session on house bill 1108 and the
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
my bill will be in the mail
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
i am introducing an amendment to um
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
representative reed's bill
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
hb 1108 the purple paint bill um
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
so we heard testimony about it we heard
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
from the environmental
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
police we heard um from some landowners
 
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
i think all of us have seen some emails
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.829 align:start position:0%
on this
um

00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
i think that there was some some good in
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
um for
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
an elderly person
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
or someone who can't get around good the
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
to have to go out and put these signs up
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
every 100 yards and maintain them is
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
very difficult and expensive
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
also at the same time allowing people to
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
just run around putting purple paint
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
um leads to other issues um that could
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
hurt hunters
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
and people just wanting to enjoy the
 
00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:02.870 align:start position:0%
and people just wanting to enjoy the
outdoors

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
outdoors
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
so i felt like a compromise was in order
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
so this is what we came up with
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
right now currently you have to have a
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
sign every 100 yards in the woods
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
with your name address and information
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
on it
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment would make it so that you
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
had to have a sign every 250 yards so
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
i've more than doubled it
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
but in between that you can put purple
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
paint on the trees
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
so if you're in the woods you're a
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
hunter you're just an outdoor enthusiast
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
if you see purple paint you know that
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
you don't have to walk more than 100
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
yards in either direction and you'll
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
know who owns the land and if it's
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
properly posted
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
so i think that's a compromise for
 
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
landowners outdoorsman hunters everybody
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
that will make it easier on property
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
owners in new hampshire
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to mark their property if
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
they so choose
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
um also there was concerns about people
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
just running around willy-nilly spray
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
painting purple paint everywhere
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
i've added a
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
punishment if they do that um if you're
 
00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.750 align:start position:0%
punishment if they do that um if you're
caught

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
caught
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
spray painting property that's not yours
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
and you don't have written landowner
 
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.829 align:start position:0%
and you don't have written landowner
permission

00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
permission
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
first offense be a misdemeanor
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
second would be a class b felony um and
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
you'd be responsible for going and
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
fixing all the trees you damaged um and
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
if that means you're going to walk
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
around and spray paint them brown again
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's it's up to the court to decide
 
00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.109 align:start position:0%
that's it's up to the court to decide
but

00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
so i've given it some teeth and i've
 
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
made a compromise i hope that you all
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
think about it
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative just a quick question the
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
refresh my memory are they are they yet
 
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
like the posted signs are they yellow
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
or or what color are they i i think i'm
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
not sure someone can correct me if they
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
i think they just have to be white i'm
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
not sure if they have to be yellow they
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
just have to be a certain size there's a
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
certain measurement and certain
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
information that has to be on them
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
does anyone know if it's going to be
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
so would it
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
i'm just thinking if when i was here
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
when we were listening this bill and
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of confusion over the
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
different colors and people don't know
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
what purple was and i remember the the
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
people from like the forest industry
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
were here speaking about that
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm thinking would it be
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
if they're going to use spray paint
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
instead of making like elderly like
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
you're saying i see that point would it
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
be better just have it all be the same
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
color instead of changing it to the
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
i think the purple thing is because
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
there are numerous states that have
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
adopted it so it's starting to pick up
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
and starting to gain knowledge i think
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
representative testament
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to put this be gentle
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
this i'm going to oppose this i think
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
ludicrous bill
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
so the question really is you know why
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
are we wasting time on this
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
i guess i would ask the chair why are
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
you letting him talk to me that way but
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna go ahead and
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna pass him
 
00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.829 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna pass him
um

00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you this we should
 
00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
as a committee we could have dealt with
 
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
this a week ago and in the meantime it's
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
generated a lot of public interest um i
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
myself have received hundreds of emails
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
and at least 70 from my own constituents
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
that like the idea so
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
i'm here to do my constitutional
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
spitting and they wanted it so they got
 
00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.589 align:start position:0%
spitting and they wanted it so they got
it

00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
yes i'm going to support this
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
not because i'm really enthusiastic
 
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
but if we amend the bill this will be
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
the bill that we'll hear in a session
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
and that will be far better than the
 
00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:57.510 align:start position:0%
and that will be far better than the
original

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
taking a look at our criminal mischief
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
law um we have a maximum
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh it look it it looks like what you may
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
have tried to do is to try to mirror
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
are crim
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
marry the penalties for violation of
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
this particular law so
 
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.589 align:start position:0%
this particular law so
um

00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh spray painting purple paint without
 
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.109 align:start position:0%
uh spray painting purple paint without
permission

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
permission
 
00:42:25.119 --> 00:42:26.150 align:start position:0%
permission
um

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.190 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
were you trying to mirror uh the
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
to some extent but this is uh is its own
 
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
um it's its own offense with different
 
00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
ramifications on criminal mischief law
 
00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
the ramifications for this could be um
 
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
if you were to do it without permission
 
00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:47.829 align:start position:0%
if you were to do it without permission
um

00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
you know if you walked around and spray
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
painted a couple hundred acres of trees
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
to and you didn't have permission to do
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
it the ramifications are far more than
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
just criminal mischief that's a lot of
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
work and expense to fix that so i felt
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
like a second offense after you've been
 
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
properly warned
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
don't spray paint people's property
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
without permission um
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
in the cost of doing it i felt justified
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit stiffer of a penalty for a
 
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative muse
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's one of the things that that does
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
concern me is if you if you look at the
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
criminal mischief statute which is 634
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
colon 2.
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
it is a lot more specific about how
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
the initial how the misdemeanor penalty
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
would be applied versus the
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
the the class b felony penalty and
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
i guess is is your feeling that
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
we might need
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
more of that type of detail in this
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
um i think that it applies equally to
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
both the first and second offense i
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
don't see where the the specification or
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
the specificity drops off it just says
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
that the second offense will be a felony
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
versus a misdemeanor if you're asking me
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
about the um the specificity as far as
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
but let's
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
let's um
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
i raise it just simply because it looks
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
it looks like what you're what you're
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
trying to do is to turn
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
um illegally spraying paint into really
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
a form of criminal mischief and i was
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
just wondering if it would make more
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
sense just to reference the existing
 
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.750 align:start position:0%
sense just to reference the existing
statute

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
than to put potentially conflicting
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know we could discuss that let
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
me let me go back to the chair unless
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
you have another question about
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
maybe it'd be more appropriate if we
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
just open it up to the executive
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
discussion for the session
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
yeah representative burt
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.910 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and thank you for taking my
question

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
have you ran this by
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
and do you have support of forest and
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
lands new hampshire forest and lands
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
jason stock new hampshire timber
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
association a land association and fish
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
and game that oppose this because they
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
tried it in maine and they're the
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
laughing stock
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
i have the support from the fish and
 
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
game said they supported the compromise
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
i did not discuss it with the um the
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
timber people
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
i have the support of my constituents i
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.750 align:start position:0%
know that
so

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
whether the timber folks like it or not
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
i know that it's being done across the
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
country in many states
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
whether how mane healed i don't know
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
and one follow-up follow-up thank you mr
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
chairman and
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
i am looking at the penalty phase
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
yes which
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
you know i support people should be
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
punished if they harm other people's
 
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:10.950 align:start position:0%
punished if they harm other people's
property

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
um the first time is a class a
 
00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.390 align:start position:0%
um the first time is a class a
misdemeanor

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
i believe that's a year in jail could be
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
maximum yeah max yep and i think up to a
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar fine but then the next
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
fine is
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
removal of your guns
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
if you're convicted of a felon
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
so that concerns me because i'm thinking
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
you know the graffiti on the billboards
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
that we see everywhere and on buildings
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's even a felon there
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
so i want to check that out before you
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
know hopefully i can check that out
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
before we go to a vote but where is the
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on this because there is a
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
huge fiscal note now that should be
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
applied to this
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
so we can pass this amendment
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
with with regard to the incarceration
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
right yeah they didn't um they didn't
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
give me one so we can send it back and
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
ask for one they would probably go to
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
finance i guess anyway
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
with regard to your question about the
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
the different punishment versus you know
 
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
losing guns and stuff
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
frankly i gotta be honest if you're
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
convicted once or spray painting
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
somebody else's property so that people
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
can't go on it and then you do it again
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
intentionally the consequences are well
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
known to you and you you reap what you
 
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:33.990 align:start position:0%
known to you and you you reap what you
sow

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:34.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
i don't have a question i mean i don't
 
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
have a question i just have commentary
 
00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.109 align:start position:0%
have a question i just have commentary
i'm

00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
this is an executive session right so i
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
don't think that the format of having a
 
00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:44.549 align:start position:0%
don't think that the format of having a
person

00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
like giving testimony is correct i think
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
just some feedback
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
i think that we're free to all just
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
discuss the bill however we'd like and
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
we don't need to um
 
00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.430 align:start position:0%
we don't need to um
[Music]

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
we don't need to treat representative
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
roy like a like a like a witness as the
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
chairman as the daryl would normally say
 
00:48:03.359 --> 00:48:04.150 align:start position:0%
chairman as the daryl would normally say
um

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
and so in that vein since it's just
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
exact session and we just talk about
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
what we think of the bill because if it
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
was a public hearing it would need to be
 
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
properly noticed correct which it has
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
been but in that vein i just wanted to
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
mention that it makes sense to just
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
knicks uh section three
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
if that's not too bad and
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
i would recommend just pausing and
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
getting something new from ols it seems
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
like it's pretty straightforward based
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
on what i'm hearing point well taken the
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
process was to have representative rory
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
introduced a bill and have a work
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
session which is what we're doing it's a
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
bit ad hoc but uh yeah we're getting the
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
work done so yeah i'd like to go back to
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
my sheet though because i'm feeling very
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i believe work sessions also
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
need to be noticed in the calendar
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
if this is a work session it needs to be
 
00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.309 align:start position:0%
if this is a work session it needs to be
noticed

00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
noticed
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
but if it's an exact session on the
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
bottom of this executive session on
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
pending legislation may be held
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the day
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
i believe we can actually so it's
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
probably trying to clarify that it can't
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do is we're going to
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm going to recess the executive
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
session it sounds like
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
there's some support
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
some not um and i will uh
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
i'll work on that and we'll come back
 
00:49:37.109 --> 00:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
with it after
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna recess the executive
 
00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.470 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna recess the executive
session

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
and now we will stand in recess until 10
 
00:49:42.480 --> 01:00:17.190 align:start position:0%
and now we will stand in recess until 10
o'clock

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%

1085 relative to ignition lock
requirements

01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%

for the record i'm laura talersky and i
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
represent hillsborough 35 which is
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
nashua ward 8.
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
today i present for your consideration
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 1085 relative to ignition
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
lock requirements
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
the issue this bill addresses first came
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
to my attention back in 2020 in the form
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
of hb 1465
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
when representative sykes submitted the
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
bill at the request of the dmv
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
it came out of house transportation with
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
an ought to pass motion and passed the
 
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
full house on the consent calendar on
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
that now infamous house session on march
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
11th and 12th 2020.
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
from there it was lost to covid in the
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
senate where it died on the table
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
several months ago i had a conversation
 
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
with director bilecki about dmv bills
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
that had been lost to covid and she
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
asked if this bill could be filed again
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
i won't go into too much detail on the
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh interlock devices since the previous
 
01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
bill also addressed what they actually
 
01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:34.630 align:start position:0%
bill also addressed what they actually
are

01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
but briefly an ignition intellect device
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
is a small handheld breathalyzer for car
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
ignitions that is installed to prevent
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
users from starting their vehicle after
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
drinking alcohol
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is clarify the
 
01:02:47.599 --> 01:02:48.390 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is clarify the
language

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
on which vehicle needs one of these
 
01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.029 align:start position:0%
on which vehicle needs one of these
devices

01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
devices
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
if i can direct your attention to the
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
bill on line five
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
it reads that a device should be
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
installed quote in any vehicle
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
registered to that person
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
or used by that person quote on a
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
regular basis
 
01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
it's that phrase on a regular basis that
 
01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:12.559 align:start position:0%
is the problem
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
i think we can all agree
 
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
that if you own a car and it's the
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
primary car you use to drive to and from
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
work that car is used on a regular basis
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
therefore that vehicle will need an
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
interlock device
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
but what about the car that is
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
registered to your spouse that you only
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
drive on weekends
 
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
technically is that on a regular basis
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
would you need an interlock device on
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
that car
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
then perhaps you borrow your friend's
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
car to run an errand or maybe use your
 
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
neighbor's pickup on the weekend to make
 
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
a run to the dump
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
again both of those scenarios
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
would your vehicle
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
need an interlock device
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
because are you using it on a regular
 
01:03:53.599 --> 01:03:55.510 align:start position:0%
because are you using it on a regular
basis

01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
this bill simply strikes out that
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
problematic phrase
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
clearly changing the statute to reflect
 
01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
that an interlocked device must be
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
installed on any car
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
used by a person who has been convicted
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
of a dwi offense
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
when in the process of reinstatement of
 
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
their license if ordered by the court
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
in layman's terms this clarifies the
 
01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.390 align:start position:0%
in layman's terms this clarifies the
intent

01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
and closes an unintended loophole that
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
currently exists
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's my hope that this committee will
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
see hb 1085 as a simple language cleanup
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
and find this bill ought to pass thank
 
01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:37.510 align:start position:0%
and find this bill ought to pass thank
you

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
could you just clarify if this
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
bill as we see it here and where the
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
language is stricken
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
was that language stricken in the
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
previous bill and this is just a clean
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
up of the previous bill as it was or is
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
this in addition to what may have been
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
on the bill that was left on the table
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative newman uh this is the
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
exact bill that died on the table in the
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
senate it just was never uh able to be
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
brought up and presented to the senate
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative boardney
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.390 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.910 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
so this bill now requires that
 
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
if i am required to use an intellect
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
device on my vehicle
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
and i have three vehicles only one of
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
which i drive
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
all three vehicles have to have
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
interlock devices
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
that's what the intent of this bill
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
would be that if you potentially have
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
three vehicles in your possession
 
01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
this would mean that every vehicle you
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
could potentially drive
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
would need to have an interlock or any
 
01:05:47.119 --> 01:05:48.069 align:start position:0%
would need to have an interlock or any
vehicle

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
01:05:48.079 --> 01:05:48.950 align:start position:0%
vehicle
you

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
ever sit behind the wheel and turn the
 
01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.470 align:start position:0%
ever sit behind the wheel and turn the
ignition

01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
representative bourdain recognized for
 
01:05:55.839 --> 01:05:57.029 align:start position:0%
representative bourdain recognized for
follow-up

01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
easier and better to require that
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
anybody that is required to have an
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
interlock device
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
while they're driving to
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
be have an interlock on device that
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
they're driving
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
versus having all their vehicles have
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
interlocked devices
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you i think i'm
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
maybe mis uh answered your previous
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
question then um this bill is the way i
 
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
understand it and i'm sure that there
 
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
might be someone who would testify after
 
01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.910 align:start position:0%
might be someone who would testify after
me

01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
cleans it up to say that any vehicle
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
a person drives would need an interlock
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
device if they have been so ordered by
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
the court
 
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
whereas the existing statute has that
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
loophole where it says
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
in any vehicle you drive on a regular
 
01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.150 align:start position:0%
in any vehicle you drive on a regular
basis

01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative testerman
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:06:58.839 --> 01:07:00.710 align:start position:0%
taking my question
uh

01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
isn't the the reason
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
or for a bill like this
 
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
you know have an interlock device
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
i think i tend to agree with
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
representative boardney
 
01:07:21.839 --> 01:07:24.630 align:start position:0%
representative boardney
that

01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
that's the issue it's
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
covering all the cars
 
01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
if he doesn't drive him or if he only
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
has one that has interlocked that's the
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
one he ought to drive
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
and if if he gets stopped you know he's
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
got a penalty but i can't see
 
01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
and do you think that we ought to
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
require everything that he has a
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
potential of getting in
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
because it happens to be owned by him or
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
a friend is a logical way to do it
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question this bill
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
does not
 
01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:57.750 align:start position:0%
does not
mean

01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
someone who is subject to an interlock
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
needs to install an interlock device on
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
every vehicle registered to him it
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
simply says that any vehicle he drives
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.839 --> 01:08:22.789 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question if you look at line
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
23 it absolutely says in any vehicle
 
01:08:28.719 --> 01:08:29.990 align:start position:0%
23 it absolutely says in any vehicle
register

01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
register
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
to the person
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
and i think that's what they're
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
referring to because it does say that or
 
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
used by that person
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
so it does say for me i have three cars
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
so i would have to have an interlock on
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
all three whether i'm driving it or not
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill says
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and i agree with you that is
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
what it says and that is what the
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
statute states now
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
the only change this bill is going to
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
make is to clarify that any vehicle
 
01:08:58.799 --> 01:08:59.669 align:start position:0%
make is to clarify that any vehicle
that

01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
someone subjective to this uh intellect

device order
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
any vehicle they drive would need an
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative boardney i think we need
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:09:18.719 --> 01:09:20.149 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
does vehicle in this case only mean
 
01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
automobile does it include snowmobile
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
and our
 
01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:28.789 align:start position:0%
and our
boats

01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
boats
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i may have to
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative greene
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question what
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
i again would defer but i would assume
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
that um a motorcycle would fall under
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
the regular
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you for taking the
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
question i just glanced very quickly at
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
what costs for
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
interlock devices are installation
 
01:10:19.199 --> 01:10:20.550 align:start position:0%
interlock devices are installation
servicing

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
servicing
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
installing servicing and then removing
 
01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.350 align:start position:0%
installing servicing and then removing
it

01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
it can get very expensive
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
i i would think i'm i'm not opposed to
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
this i'm i'm just thinking
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
there's a question here
 
01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.590 align:start position:0%
there's a question here
oh

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
i'm struggling with it it's there is a
 
01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.830 align:start position:0%
i'm struggling with it it's there is a
question

01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
a question would be as a public service
 
01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:48.070 align:start position:0%
a question would be as a public service
with

01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
people being against dwi
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
exposing the cost of all of this might
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
be a d
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
could be a
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
it could be a deterrent that's not a
 
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
very good question but i'm done thank
 
01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:03.430 align:start position:0%
very good question but i'm done thank
you

01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not sure that there was a
 
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
question there
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
if i may if the chair may inquire with
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
the question and
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
so if i was convicted hypothetically of
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
an aggravated dwi fan so i would have to
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
put interlock device to my own vehicle
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
if uh
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
you were gracious enough to let me
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
borrow your vehicle
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
what would happen in that scenario
 
01:11:36.719 --> 01:11:37.510 align:start position:0%
what would happen in that scenario
under

01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
today's statute
 
01:11:42.149 --> 01:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
my interpretation would be that you
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
would be able to drive my car because
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
you don't drive my car on a regular
 
01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.630 align:start position:0%
you don't drive my car on a regular
basis

01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
what i understand
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
would close that loophole
 
01:11:52.159 --> 01:11:53.510 align:start position:0%
would close that loophole
and

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
it said that you would need to use it
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
by that person
 
01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:01.830 align:start position:0%
by that person
period

01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative is the intent of this
 
01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:09.669 align:start position:0%
representative is the intent of this
bill

01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
solely that somebody who is required to
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
be operating with an interlock device
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
uses an interlock device when they
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
operate a motor vehicle
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question the point
 
01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
of this is to make sure that anyone who
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
is subjective to the order of using an
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
intellect device must use an intellect
 
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
device on any vehicle that they get
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel and turn the ignition
 
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative roy thank you and just to
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative conley
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
this bill does not mandate installation
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
of extra interlock devices and vehicles
 
01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
it just mandates that the driver
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
only use one that has an interlock
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
device is that correct
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um in the
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
previous bill um someone stated that if
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
someone's subjected to this order they
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
understand what it means and they
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
learn all the rules
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
and i believe that this bill simply
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
codifies one of those rules which is you
 
01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
need to use an intellect device if
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
you're driving that's what this bill
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
does it makes sure that someone who
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
should not be driving with anything
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
other than an intellect device
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
cannot it does not mean that they need
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
to go install one on their
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
mother-in-law's vehicle or their
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh just briefly um
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
we with the department of safety state
 
01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
police um
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
support this um the testimony we've just
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
heard covers
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
basically everything i was gonna say uh
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
other than this is to make sure that
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
any vehicle that a person subject to
 
01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:21.030 align:start position:0%
any vehicle that a person subject to
this

01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.030 align:start position:0%
this
regulation

01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
operates a vehicle that has an interlock
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
device in it
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
basically we're just trying to make sure
 
01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.149 align:start position:0%
basically we're just trying to make sure
that

01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
they're complying with what the court
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
representative welch
 
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
do you think that it would be worthwhile
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
if somebody's convicted
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
and is subject to having an intellect
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
device that if there's four cars
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
registered in that family that all the
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
unique question
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
i think somebody from the civilian
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
civil liberties union would probably
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
um marking marking somebody uh that way
 
01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.149 align:start position:0%
um marking marking somebody uh that way
i

01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we would support that
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
further question
 
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
representative welch recognized for a
 
01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.750 align:start position:0%
representative welch recognized for a
follow-up

01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:28.709 align:start position:0%
follow-up
uh

01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
back along oh several years back we had
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
a judge come up here from ohio
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
and in ohio they had a deal where
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
everybody in that household
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
got a yellow license plate
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
which meant that
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
during the
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
anytime they saw that car with a yellow
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
license plate they could stop it to
 
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
check to make sure that it wasn't the
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
convicted driver
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
driving it
 
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
in some families
 
01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
you have an enabler who allows the let's
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
say the husband is a drunk
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
and the wife puts up with it and the
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
wife has to go grocery shopping and
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
i think they have elected judges in ohio
 
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how that judge survived
 
01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.470 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how that judge survived
but

01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
that was a scenario
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
it was to make the
 
01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:25.110 align:start position:0%
it was to make the
uh

01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
try to convince the guy who was drinking
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
all the time to not drink
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a novel approach
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
but seeing that there was not a question
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
i i'll leave it to the witness to
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
and just just
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
members are recognized to ask questions
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
of the witness to obtain information
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
either about the testimony or about the
 
01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.350 align:start position:0%
either about the testimony or about the
bill

01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
we are not permitted to debate the
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
witness and let's not make
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh generalized statements even if i
 
01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
agree with the statement you're making
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not um
 
01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
in order for that to happen so i would
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
just ask that
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
we make it through the day without
 
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
having to bring this up again
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
so can you define vehicle
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
does it apply to snowmobiles and
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
boats and motorcycles
 
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
in this instance yes the term vehicle is
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
any motorized
 
01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
motor transportation wouldn't be a
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
bicycle but snowmobile motorcycle boat
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
atv utv any anything that was
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
that's motorized
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative boarding
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for protecting
 
01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
my question uh our intellect
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh interlock devices available for
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
all all these types of vehicles
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
i believe they are
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
common as one for a regular passenger
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle but yes my understanding is that
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
they can be installed on anything
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
oh representative
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
harry katherine has a question for the
 
01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
witness if you don't mind um
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
i realize that um
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
the information that i asked about on
 
01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
line 23
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
and i thank um representative tulerski
 
01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.630 align:start position:0%
and i thank um representative tulerski
for

01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
helping me to remember that this is
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
already in the bill but would you have a
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
problem in taking that piece out what
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
that refers to line 23 where it refers
 
01:18:38.159 --> 01:18:38.870 align:start position:0%
that refers to line 23 where it refers
to

01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
so what you're asking is that would we
 
01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:47.830 align:start position:0%
so what you're asking is that would we
oppose

01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:48.790 align:start position:0%
oppose
the

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
language that said any vehicle
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
registered to that person striking that
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
and just have it to be
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
say any vehicle used by the person
 
01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.430 align:start position:0%
say any vehicle used by the person
exactly

01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we would oppose that
 
01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.470 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we would oppose that
um

01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
because yeah you
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
use vehicles that aren't registered to
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
them on a daily basis as well so
 
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we would oppose
 
01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:19.030 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we would oppose
that

01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's the first i've heard of
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
that though
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you mr chairman
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh would you agree with me that that
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
language also appears in line five and
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
would need to be amended there
 
01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.830 align:start position:0%
would need to be amended there
yes

01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.630 align:start position:0%
yes
no

01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
somebody else will speak to that
 
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
this is just my interpretation the
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
difference between line five and lines
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
23 lines 23 applies to
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
someone who's under the age of 21 where
 
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
lines five would apply to i presumably
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
someone over the age 21. that's just how
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.239 --> 01:20:11.830 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:12.870 align:start position:0%
sorry
well

01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
when there's a subsection that's
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
different that specifically addresses
 
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
the age 21 and under
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
i would interpret that if the prior
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
section would not apply
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
okay and it only applies to aggravated
 
01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
this is involving an individual that has
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
an aggravated dwi
 
01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
offense or has had a subsequent offense
 
01:20:34.239 --> 01:20:41.110 align:start position:0%
offense or has had a subsequent offense
conviction

01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
anyone may correct me if i read that
 
01:20:42.639 --> 01:20:44.550 align:start position:0%
anyone may correct me if i read that
wrong

01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1085 we next call britney
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
morning members of the committee a lot
 
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
of great conversation going on here and
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that i can provide some
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
clarification um to your questions the
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
best of my ability and if i cannot i
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
will be certainly happy to mark those uh
 
01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
questions and get back to you
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:21:16.149 --> 01:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
is at the request of the department and
 
01:21:16.159 --> 01:21:16.950 align:start position:0%
is at the request of the department and
yes

01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
removing on a regular basis does help
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
clarify two people subjected to the
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
program that they can only drive a
 
01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle equipped with an
 
01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
iid there are instances again where this
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
is my wife's car i'm running to the
 
01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.350 align:start position:0%
is my wife's car i'm running to the
store

01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
store
 
01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
um what it does is it makes it
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
consistent with the subsequent um
 
01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
chapter 2637 which is our convention and
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
that states any vehicle technically a
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
person who's operating a vehicle without
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
an iid that's their convention
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
so what we want to do is strengthen this
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
program and make sure that it's clear to
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
those program participants what their
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
expectations are and that there's no
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
ambiguity in the law to prosecutors and
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
the program participants law enforcement
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
it really brings the program all
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
together to make sure everyone
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
understands their responsibilities
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
because as mentioned these ignition
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
interlock devices can be costly to a
 
01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.790 align:start position:0%
interlock devices can be costly to a
person

01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
and what this is saying is that if a
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle is registered to a person they
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
have to have an id if this person is
 
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
using the vehicle on a regular basis
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
or actually removing that if they're
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
using a vehicle so in a household with a
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
husband and wife situation
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
let's just say vehicles register the
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
husband and another vehicle registered
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
to the wife if that vehicle is
 
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
registered to the wife and the husband
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
is not using that vehicle does not touch
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
it does not think about it doesn't even
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
think about thinking about it
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
they do not need to install a device
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
what the person's responsibility is is
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
to drive a vehicle that is equipped with
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
an ignition interlock device
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's really important that they are
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
complying with their restriction
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
so to answer some questions here
 
01:22:58.229 --> 01:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
in regards to marking a person's plate
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
it is technically already in statute
 
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
that the department can mark a person's
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
plate do we practice that no
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
in regards to line 23 yes it's pursuant
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
to people who are under the age of 21.
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
if a person is under the age of 21 and
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
has multiple vehicles registered to them
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
and they're drinking and driving we
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
really need to make sure that we are
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
focusing on that person to make sure
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
that they're complying with the program
 
01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
and that they're rehabilitating in a
 
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
proper way
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
why yes it can be monetarily
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
expensive to that person if they're only
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
driving one vehicle and they only have
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
one vehicle registered to them
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
they are at the same as any other person
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
who is subject to an ignition interlock
 
01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:39.669 align:start position:0%
who is subject to an ignition interlock
device

01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
device
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
with that i'll be happy to take any
 
01:23:41.199 --> 01:23:44.629 align:start position:0%
with that i'll be happy to take any
questions

01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
my question could you give us a figure
 
01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
what it would cost a person in one year
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
to have that device put on their vehicle
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
i'm actually going to have um this
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
gentleman here come up and answer that
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
question specifically so you have better
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
information if you don't mind
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
since you're here
 
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:28.830 align:start position:0%
 
thank

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.390 align:start position:0%
thank
you

01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
for the record uh my name is robert
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
blaisdell and i represent consumer
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
safety technology
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
in tuxelok we're out of des moines iowa
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
and i've been involved with this
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
program ever since the early 2000s
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
ever all the way back to the rfp process
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
to answer your question representative
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
my understanding is it's for the
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
installation it's roughly about 150
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
for the daily cost
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
it can depend um
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's anywhere between two dollars and
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
fifty cents to three dollars a day
 
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
um what we're finding though is that
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
some of these costs
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
um are are rising to like cars such as
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
like teslas for example or it's a little
 
01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
bit more complicated
 
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
um but that's that's roughly what i'm
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
aware of it's 150 to put it on 150 to
 
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
take it off
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:33.669 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
if you didn't have this i id
 
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
system in place the appropriate thing
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
would be to take the person's license
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
for a long period of time correct this
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
is a multiple offense
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
in the scenario when a person is subject
 
01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
to an ignition interlock order they do
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
not have the ability to wait it out they
 
01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:54.639 align:start position:0%
must comply with the compliance
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
requirement which is the installation if
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
they are so ordered by the department of
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
safety or the new hampshire court system
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
what i meant to say was uh
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
if nearly quite follow-up recognize for
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
a follow-up thank you
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
what i meant to say is we didn't have
 
01:26:11.189 --> 01:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
this whole program in place the iid
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
the appropriate thing to do for somebody
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
who's been convicted for drinking after
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
ratification or not having a license
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
would be to say they couldn't drive
 
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
period for a number of periods of years
 
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question a person
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
who's convicted of dwi
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
would serve out their suspension period
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
if they are then caught operating after
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
suspension or revocation yes there's
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
additional additional sanctions and if a
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
person chooses not to install an
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
ignition inner lock device as a
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
condition of restoration then they will
 
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
indefinitely remain suspended until they
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
comply good thank you
 
01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
pardon my voice um
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
i i think there's just a little
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
confusion and i i want to clear it up
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
why are we getting involved in you know
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
which vehicle or this vehicle uh versus
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
just focusing on the operator and saying
 
01:27:09.510 --> 01:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
you cannot drive a vehicle i don't care
 
01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
what it is without an interlock device
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
and then putting the penalty on the
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
driver why are we starting to get into
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
which vehicle has what and installation
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
and all this stuff if the if the
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
driver's only able to drive with an
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
interlock device
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
why why even get into the vehicles
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
i think that is a great question thank
 
01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:29.990 align:start position:0%
i think that is a great question thank
you

01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
the focus is on the operator of the
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle and making sure that they
 
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
understand their expectations that they
 
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
cannot operate a vehicle
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
without ignition interlock device
 
01:27:40.639 --> 01:27:42.629 align:start position:0%
without ignition interlock device
follow-up

01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative roy recognized for a
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up so
 
01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
the the bill
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
needn't only say uh an operator subject
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
to an uh an interlock device may not
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
operate any vehicle that does not have
 
01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
an interlock device is that not simple
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
enough just like that
 
01:27:59.110 --> 01:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your follow-up i think
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
that is fair language and we are
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
certainly open to addressing the ways
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
that we can ensure that people
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
are only operating
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
a vehicle when they have an iid order
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
and taking the ambiguity out of the law
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
and making sure that there isn't that
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
space for them to say well i don't
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
operate this vehicle on a regular basis
 
01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:18.550 align:start position:0%
operate this vehicle on a regular basis
okay

01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh i know it's
 
01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
in the rsa now however
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
in three places in the bill it's
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned that and any vehicle
 
01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
what would be your department's position
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
on removing
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
the wording and that you have to put
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
this in any vehicle registered
 
01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
is do you see that as a problem
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question are you
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
asking if we put any vehicle registered
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
to them
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
no if if we strike if we strike that if
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
if that were in an amendment if that
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
were removed
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
the wording
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
that they had to uh put this device in
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
i'm asking because as you said the the
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
purpose is
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure the person under this court
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
order follows
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
without a device installed in the
 
01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:37.510 align:start position:0%
without a device installed in the
vehicle

01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
i think that is a great question and i
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
think i would need to further assess
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
that to
 
01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
give a
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
a better answer
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
um because again we have to understand
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
in totality how that impacts the driver
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
and their vehicles and what they're
 
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
representative connolly thank you and
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
not to belabor this but
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
the representative who just asked a
 
01:30:03.679 --> 01:30:04.870 align:start position:0%
the representative who just asked a
question

01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
or maybe it was just before said if we
 
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
clarify the law to say that
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
somebody subject to these requirements
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
uses this device when they drive does
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
that not meet the criteria and the goal
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
of this bill rather than getting into
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
however many vehicles they own and so
 
01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:22.070 align:start position:0%
however many vehicles they own and so
forth

01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
forth
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
you ha you
 
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
does that clear it is that clarity
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
something that we can cert that we can
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
go for
 
01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely and i apologize i see how
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
the answer for here and there um i just
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that when we adjust
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
this law that we're adjusting correctly
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
and yes what you guys are saying is the
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
fact that it's the owner well not the
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
owner the person that is subject to the
 
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
order and compliance with that order so
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
representative ray newman
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:55.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
for my identification could you just
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
clarify how
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
a person who has to drive with an inter
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me interlock device
 
01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
how that affects their ability to drive
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
and how the thing works
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:19.030 --> 01:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
the short answer representative is
 
01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:20.310 align:start position:0%
the short answer representative is
um

01:31:20.310 --> 01:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
nothing gets affected so long as they're
 
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
the longer answer is
 
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
how it affects
 
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
their their situation um
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
they are subject to having to blow into
 
01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
the device prior to starting they are
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
also subject to a random
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
rolling retest um and that's just to
 
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
prevent the example of okay i'm sober
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
now but i got my six-pack ready to go
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
here they they know that they're going
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
to be subject to at any given time
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's i guess the um to
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
the extent of that's how it impacts them
 
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative ray newman recognized for
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you so that information is that
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
information recorded
 
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere when it happens that the
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
person now has finished the six-pack
 
01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:14.550 align:start position:0%
person now has finished the six-pack
and

01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
the car is then disabled i understand i
 
01:32:17.679 --> 01:32:18.870 align:start position:0%
the car is then disabled i understand i
assume

01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
assume
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
and then is that information who is that
 
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
information available
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
to and how how does that affect
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
sure their situation okay so a couple of
 
01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
things um
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
when when there is a a violation it's um
 
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
everything is recorded and it's i
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
believe the law says that it has to be
 
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
sent in or transmitted in real time is
 
01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.390 align:start position:0%
sent in or transmitted in real time is
that

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's for the for the enhanced version
 
01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:45.830 align:start position:0%
that's for the for the enhanced version
um

01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
so yes there is uh there's a whole
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
communication system set up between the
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
the various vendors and the department
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
so that there's violation reports and
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
and and whatnot um you mentioned about
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
disabling the vehicle i want to be
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely clear here that during um a
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
random rolling retest when they're going
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
down 93
 
01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
the car isn't automatically disabled um
 
01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
it's what happens then at that point is
 
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
is if there's a violation they need to
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
turn over because it's there's a
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
violation the horn is blaring and then
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
there would be a lockout for a period of
 
01:33:17.679 --> 01:33:19.350 align:start position:0%
there would be a lockout for a period of
time

01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you um thank you again for
 
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
the opportunity so i'm as i'm reading
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
through this and taking into
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
consideration the idea is brought forth
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that the spirit of
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
the ignition interlock is installed so
 
01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
if we are proposing that after a period
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
of revocation or suspension to install
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
an ignition interlock device as defined
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
in rsa 259 49a
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
in any vehicle used by that person for
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
if

01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
if you install something for not less
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
than 12 months
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
and that's outside the period of his
 
01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:22.870 align:start position:0%
and that's outside the period of his
sentence

01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
is that's the right thing to do i mean
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
why are you leaving it on there i'm not
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
sure if i heard that correctly
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question that is just
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
where i stopped reading in the statute
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's at minimum or 12-month
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
compliance and depending on violations
 
01:34:40.149 --> 01:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
depending on the 24-month depending on
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
circumvention it can be in a vehicle for
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
a much longer duration what's important
 
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
is to recognize that a device must be
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
installed in a vehicle that a person
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
uses in order to be in compliance with
 
01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
the ignition interlock program so while
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
we are speaking about the driver
 
01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
specifically there is a vehicle
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
installation aspect to the ignition
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%

can do can you provide the committee any
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
examples of

what an aggravated dui offense would
 
01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:27.510 align:start position:0%
what an aggravated dui offense would
entail

01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question an
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
aggravated dwi offense
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
would be somebody that had a blood
 
01:35:34.239 --> 01:35:35.590 align:start position:0%
would be somebody that had a blood
alcohol

01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
breath alcohol concentration greater
 
01:35:40.709 --> 01:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
than um a 1 6.
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
legal limits point zero eight
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
aggravated be 1.6 so and out
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
basically double what the
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
um minimum is
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
also if they
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
tried to elude
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
the police
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
was involved in a
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
crash that
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
resulted in
 
01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
bodily injury any of those are
 
01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:04.950 align:start position:0%
bodily injury any of those are
aggravating

01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
aggravating
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
factors which would then
 
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh is there any
 
01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:30.070 align:start position:0%
uh is there any
uh

01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
what am i trying to think of
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
circumstances and like there where new
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%

there are a number of
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
allow the division of motor vehicles to

i know there are a number of things that
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
could that could occur but yes that that
 
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
is a possibility
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:09.040 align:start position:0%

committee
 
01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:46.629 align:start position:0%
committee
uh

01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%

01:52:52.149 --> 01:52:52.159 align:start position:0%
however it was unceremoniously tabled
 
01:52:52.159 --> 01:52:53.830 align:start position:0%
however it was unceremoniously tabled
um

01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
over my objection so i re i have now
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
refiled the same exact bill
 
01:53:01.990 --> 01:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
when you turn on the news
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes you'll hear a news report
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
about someone who's been arrested and
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
convicted of their fifth or sixth drunk
 
01:53:09.669 --> 01:53:09.679 align:start position:0%
driving conviction and people always
 
01:53:11.189 --> 01:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
wonder how does that happen how does
 
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
this person still have a driver's
 
01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:13.830 align:start position:0%
this person still have a driver's
license

01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire when a subsequent
 
01:53:18.790 --> 01:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
offense is prosecuted
 
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
there's a look-back period the look-back
 
01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:22.550 align:start position:0%
there's a look-back period the look-back
period

01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
for all the offenses is 10 years
 
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
so the third
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
fourth fifth offense would all have to
 
01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
happen within a ten year
 
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
time period
 
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do it simply would
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
extend the look back time period for the
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
third in fourth offenses uh the
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
rationale for that is uh quite often the
 
01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
third and fourth offense don't occur
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
within that the ten-year window and
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
during that ten years especially with
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
someone who's been now convicted two
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
times of
 
01:53:58.229 --> 01:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
that person's license has been suspended
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
for a large portion of that time period
 
01:54:06.149 --> 01:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
so this is really this is really
 
01:54:08.229 --> 01:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
addressed to
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
repeat offenders
 
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
specifically third and fourth offenders
 
01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
and it would just simply extend that
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
look-back period in that limited
 
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
circumstance it does not prevent
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
someone from obtaining an annulment of a
 
01:54:20.159 --> 01:54:21.430 align:start position:0%
someone from obtaining an annulment of a
conviction

01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
conviction
 
01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
which is a 10-year time period for any
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
drunk driving conviction and if a person
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
were to get in that conviction annulled
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
it would still it would not necessarily
 
01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:33.679 align:start position:0%
mean that wouldn't count towards the
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
subsequent offense so that was the
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill was really to
 
01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:38.149 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill was really to
address

01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:54:39.910 --> 01:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
repeat offenders and we're talking third
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
and fourth offen offenders not
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
first and seconds
 
01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:44.870 align:start position:0%
first and seconds
and

01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:45.990 align:start position:0%
and
personally

01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
personally
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
the way i look at it is if an individual
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
is continuing to break the law
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
especially commit the same offense
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
that they've already been convicted for
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
in two occasions one that person is
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
engaging in behavior that creates a
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
risk in danger to public safety
 
01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
01:55:06.629 --> 01:55:06.639 align:start position:0%
it's it also shows that person has not
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
been rehabilitated
 
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
at all by the punishment or penalty for
 
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
a first and second offense
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
so i would hope passing the committee
 
01:55:17.589 --> 01:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
last term i hope again it passes
 
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
this time i hope it passes in the house
 
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
and no one makes a motion to table it
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
and i'll of course
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%

01:56:16.149 --> 01:56:16.159 align:start position:0%
annulled then
 
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
that would still count
 
01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
how's that going to be counted and i
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
didn't see any reference into
 
01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:23.679 align:start position:0%
in the language of the bill about
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
annulment of convictions
 
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
being an exception
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
last term and i believe it was
 
01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
if i'm going off a memory it was
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 311 and that the as
 
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
as it came to the committee last term
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
it involved the annulments of several
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
different areas but one of the one of
 
01:56:44.159 --> 01:56:45.430 align:start position:0%
different areas but one of the one of
the

01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
sections of that bill was specifically
 
01:56:51.109 --> 01:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
um drunk driving convictions and the
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
look they wanted that wanted to reduce
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
the look back period not i shouldn't say
 
01:56:57.189 --> 01:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
look back period the time period from
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
the date of your conviction to when a
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
person would be eligible to get an
 
01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
annulment but in that in the language in
 
01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
the existing law is if you get a
 
01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:07.750 align:start position:0%
the existing law is if you get a
offense

01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
offense
 
01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
if you get an annulment of an offense it
 
01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
negate it from counting as a subsequent
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
towards subsequent offenses
 
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's just what we were what
 
01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
what is as written now can you prove
 
01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
it can a sub a prior offense when it's
 
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
been annulled that it that could be
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
rather difficult
 
01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's a that can be challenging
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
because you would have to prove
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
the conviction and if you don't have
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
access to the records it can be hard to
 
01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:36.790 align:start position:0%
access to the records it can be hard to
do

01:57:36.790 --> 01:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
there was some disagreement
 
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
between myself and the uh
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
well-known unh uh law professor that
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
frequents here very
 
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
very frequently we disagreed on how that
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
would be proven in a court of law but
 
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
that's what to look back here this
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't affect that
 
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
by any means and i'm not trying to
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
address the annulment issue all right
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you i i have no further questions
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
01:58:06.790 --> 01:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:08.229 --> 01:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
something i'm just interested in some
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
clarification on is um
 
01:58:13.109 --> 01:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
it appears at the bottom of the bill
 
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
there's some language that would include
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
an out-of-state conviction as one of the
 
01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
offenses that would qualify as a third
 
01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
or fourth offense
 
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
is is that true and and how do things
 
01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:27.679 align:start position:0%
like out-of-state convictions uh
 
01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that for
 
01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
the purposes of considering subsequent
 
01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
offenses and specifically for drunk
 
01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:42.870 align:start position:0%
offenses and specifically for drunk
driving

01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
driving
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's the practice of the overall i think
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
i want to say every state will consider
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
out-of-state convictions
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
when it comes to whether it's a
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
subsequent offense or not
 
01:58:54.629 --> 01:58:54.639 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire's purposes again we
 
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
have a limited look-back period every
 
01:58:57.990 --> 01:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
state has a different look-back period
 
01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
some some states have an unlimited
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
look-back period period
 
01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:02.709 align:start position:0%
look-back period period
so

01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
this is really what this is focusing on
 
01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:05.910 align:start position:0%
this is really what this is focusing on
is

01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
it can count out-of-state convictions
 
01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe that that would
 
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
change the look-back period
 
01:59:12.310 --> 01:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
at all it just
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's a second third or fourth
 
01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:15.669 align:start position:0%
whether it's a second third or fourth
offense

01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
offense
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
it would take into consideration
 
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
out-of-state conviction
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
and a lot of driving laws will factor in
 
01:59:29.350 --> 01:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
so i i guess just to clarify for me
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
because i'm i'm less familiar with our
 
01:59:35.189 --> 01:59:35.199 align:start position:0%
drunk driving laws than i probably
 
01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:59:36.159 --> 01:59:36.950 align:start position:0%
should be
um

01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
but um under current new hampshire law
 
01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:41.109 align:start position:0%
but um under current new hampshire law
uh

01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:41.119 --> 01:59:42.310 align:start position:0%
uh
our

01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
our out-of-state convictions um actually
 
01:59:45.599 --> 01:59:46.790 align:start position:0%
our out-of-state convictions um actually
counted

01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
counted
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
as uh as as prior convictions so for
 
01:59:49.679 --> 01:59:50.629 align:start position:0%
as uh as as prior convictions so for
instance

01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
um if we're looking at determining uh
 
01:59:55.350 --> 01:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
let's say whether somebody's been
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
convicted three times
 
01:59:58.870 --> 01:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
would a conviction in massachusetts or
 
02:00:00.070 --> 02:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
vermont count as one of those
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
convictions that would trigger that part
 
02:00:04.709 --> 02:00:04.719 align:start position:0%
of our law
 
02:00:05.910 --> 02:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the
 
02:00:08.149 --> 02:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
out-of-state conviction will
 
02:00:11.589 --> 02:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
be considered provided it's it's the
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
equivalence so if the legal limit is .08
 
02:00:17.589 --> 02:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
or higher let's just say for the sake of
 
02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
argument another state their legal limit
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
was point
 
02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
one one two
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
i think i have to go the opposite
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
direction my whole point is it would
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
have to also be consistent with our laws
 
02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:31.189 align:start position:0%
have to also be consistent with our laws
so

02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:34.070 --> 02:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
if you if let's just say that it was .06
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
in vermont which it's not but let's just
 
02:00:38.229 --> 02:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
say that it is if you've got a drunk
 
02:00:40.149 --> 02:00:40.159 align:start position:0%
driving convictions and your
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
blood alcohol content was .06
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
although you violated vermont law
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
because it's not the reason
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
the equivalent of the new hampshire law
 
02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
my reading of this is that that would
 
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
not actually count as a prior offense
 
02:00:55.830 --> 02:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
because of the blood alcohol content
 
02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:57.109 align:start position:0%
because of the blood alcohol content
difference

02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware but i'm not aware of any
 
02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
state that does not have point zero
 
02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:02.149 align:start position:0%
state that does not have point zero
eight

02:01:02.149 --> 02:01:02.159 align:start position:0%
eight
 
02:01:03.669 --> 02:01:03.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:06.629 --> 02:01:06.639 align:start position:0%
would it um question i
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it uh under the um
 
02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
under the um
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's the equal
 
02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
protection what is the there's a i think
 
02:01:17.589 --> 02:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
my constitutional laws fail me right now
 
02:01:20.310 --> 02:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
but the uh the the where we recognize
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
the laws of other states i believe that
 
02:01:25.270 --> 02:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
would that not cover that
 
02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
i believe you're
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
referring to the full faith and credit
 
02:01:30.070 --> 02:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
clause that's the one
 
02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:30.870 align:start position:0%
clause that's the one
i

02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:01:33.589 --> 02:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
without getting into getting into the
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
that constitutional principle it's very
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
common that when it comes to drunk drunk
 
02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
driving convictions that you factor and
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
you consider other
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
out-of-state convictions
 
02:01:44.639 --> 02:01:45.510 align:start position:0%
out-of-state convictions
and

02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's something that a lot of the
 
02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
states kind of joined together as an
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative bordenay
 
02:01:56.070 --> 02:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:01:58.870 --> 02:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
my question again
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
and it
 
02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh says occurring more than 10 years
 
02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:08.149 align:start position:0%
uh says occurring more than 10 years
with

02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:02:10.390 --> 02:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
after the date of the present offense
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
isn't that in
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
that's indefinite isn't it
 
02:02:16.070 --> 02:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
should that be within
 
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh 10 years
 
02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
let me read it sure
 
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
let me as you don't mind if i may read
 
02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
it in
 
02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
the chair so grace will let you
 
02:02:31.270 --> 02:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:35.589 --> 02:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:57.750 --> 02:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:59.910 --> 02:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
is are you pointing out is your question
 
02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
is that a drafting error
 
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
i'm asking if that's the intent or is it
 
02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
are are not
 
02:03:10.470 --> 02:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
so this is only for offenses
 
02:03:14.790 --> 02:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
after 10 years
 
02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:19.189 align:start position:0%
after 10 years
forever

02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:19.199 --> 02:03:20.470 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
the intent is for that to be within the
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
i'm aware and i'm very thankful that my
 
02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
my friend from
 
02:03:33.030 --> 02:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
keene was so kind to point that out
 
02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
i'm even i'm even more thankful that he
 
02:03:36.629 --> 02:03:36.639 align:start position:0%
serves on on this great committee with
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
me so we can work together to fix that
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
and actually you know
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
i will take the i'll take the heat for
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
this i believe representative welch
 
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh pointed this out last year and it's
 
02:03:50.550 --> 02:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
but but i'm glad i'm glad everyone was
 
02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:53.189 align:start position:0%
but but i'm glad i'm glad everyone was
uh

02:03:53.189 --> 02:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
on their toes and caught that
 
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
reference that same line
 
02:04:05.430 --> 02:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
after it's corrected
 
02:04:07.669 --> 02:04:07.679 align:start position:0%
would and there is a penalty associated
 
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
with that of a class a misdemeanor
 
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
so if someone had a
 
02:04:16.629 --> 02:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
dwi offense first offense in that time
 
02:04:16.639 --> 02:04:17.990 align:start position:0%
dwi offense first offense in that time
period

02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:04:20.310 --> 02:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
is that the same penalty or it seems to
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
be in bold or has the penalty been
 
02:04:30.390 --> 02:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's inquiring it's dealing with a
 
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
prior a subsequent conviction so that
 
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
would be the second offense is a
 
02:04:40.069 --> 02:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
what i understand any class a
 
02:04:40.079 --> 02:04:41.270 align:start position:0%
what i understand any class a
misdemeanor

02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
there be no further questions oh there
 
02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
is one representative true
 
02:04:51.910 --> 02:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
um i believe you said that
 
02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we already take into
 
02:04:58.320 --> 02:04:59.990 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we already take into
consideration

02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
02:05:02.390 --> 02:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
out of state convictions
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
when you when you're adding up the
 
02:05:05.350 --> 02:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
number of offenses
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
that being the case
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
why do we need section b
 
02:05:10.709 --> 02:05:10.719 align:start position:0%
page on
 
02:05:12.390 --> 02:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
on line 28
 
02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:19.030 --> 02:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
i think what this is doing it's
 
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
clarifying the look back period that's
 
02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
my that's my understanding what the
 
02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of that section is
 
02:05:26.629 --> 02:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
is how far do you go back in time
 
02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
from one where you're going to consider
 
02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
a prior
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
prior offense so if you have a
 
02:05:34.229 --> 02:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
conviction then 30 years later you get a
 
02:05:34.239 --> 02:05:35.830 align:start position:0%
conviction then 30 years later you get a
second

02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
that won't be considered but i think
 
02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:38.550 align:start position:0%
that won't be considered but i think
it's

02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
when considering the out-of-state you
 
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
want to make sure the look-back period
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
is the same
 
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%

02:05:49.199 --> 02:05:50.310 align:start position:0%

does anyone wish to speak on the on the
 
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
motion representative rory
 
02:12:29.589 --> 02:12:29.599 align:start position:0%
yes if um if i recall from the testimony
 
02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
this um
 
02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
the intent is obviously you know great
 
02:12:36.629 --> 02:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
but the the there was confusion
 
02:12:38.470 --> 02:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
about what constituted you know
 
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
intentional poisoning versus accidental
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
poisoning whose property the poison was
 
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
on it was it was very complicated um
 
02:12:48.950 --> 02:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
and even speaking of law enforcement it
 
02:12:51.270 --> 02:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
would be difficult to uh
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
to enforce as it was written
 
02:12:56.310 --> 02:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
um we already have um felony uh animal
 
02:12:58.390 --> 02:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
cruelty statutes
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
if it should become necessary to to
 
02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
actually codify poisoning as part of
 
02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:05.189 align:start position:0%
actually codify poisoning as part of
that

02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
i think it needs to be done in a much
 
02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
clearer fashion than than this bill
 
02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:10.870 align:start position:0%
clearer fashion than than this bill
presented

02:13:10.870 --> 02:13:10.880 align:start position:0%

the clock and try to
 
02:18:25.990 --> 02:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
gauge on what we can get done before the
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
next hearing so we don't have members of
 
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:30.080 align:start position:0%

motion of inx being to legislate
 
02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:08.469 align:start position:0%
motion of inx being to legislate
briefly

02:19:08.469 --> 02:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
so i think like many people in the
 
02:19:11.669 --> 02:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
committee i didn't have a great
 
02:19:11.679 --> 02:19:13.110 align:start position:0%
committee i didn't have a great
background

02:19:13.110 --> 02:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
background
 
02:19:14.709 --> 02:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
or knowledge of
 
02:19:16.549 --> 02:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
psilocybin mushrooms and it sounds like
 
02:19:19.030 --> 02:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
there really are some true medicinal
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
benefits to this
 
02:19:24.150 --> 02:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
that said
 
02:19:26.469 --> 02:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
um i think we're not there yet i think
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of questions that
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
committee members might have and
 
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
especially in a state that hasn't yet
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
decriminalized or hasn't yet legalized
 
02:19:37.349 --> 02:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis this might just be a tad too
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
representative gareth recognized
 
02:19:50.389 --> 02:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:19:50.399 --> 02:19:51.270 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
for whatever reasons and i and maybe
 
02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
didn't happen
 
02:19:56.950 --> 02:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
i wrote on his study committee
 
02:19:58.710 --> 02:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
was this supposed to go to study
 
02:19:58.720 --> 02:19:59.990 align:start position:0%
was this supposed to go to study
committee

02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just asking a question i i don't
 
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
know why i made that notation on my
 
02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.230 align:start position:0%
know why i made that notation on my
sheet

02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm just asking a question
 
02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
02:20:13.750 --> 02:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
an amendment that was floating around
 
02:20:16.389 --> 02:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
obviously it's not but it was
 
02:20:19.349 --> 02:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
my my understanding that amendment was
 
02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
not germane
 
02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
02:20:24.469 --> 02:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
and that amendment really was focusing
 
02:20:28.150 --> 02:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
on more of the issue of medical
 
02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:29.349 align:start position:0%
on more of the issue of medical
use

02:20:29.349 --> 02:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:20:29.359 --> 02:20:32.070 align:start position:0%
use
which

02:20:32.070 --> 02:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's a separate subject
 
02:20:36.389 --> 02:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
altogether that that policies are really
 
02:20:38.070 --> 02:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
outside the purview of what we would do
 
02:20:40.870 --> 02:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
here in criminal justice public safety
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
my my feeling on that
 
02:20:44.950 --> 02:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
subject is that
 
02:20:47.349 --> 02:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
in order for this committee to
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
do its due diligence in evaluating a
 
02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:50.790 align:start position:0%
do its due diligence in evaluating a
penalty

02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
you would need to first master the
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
medical policy that you would put in
 
02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:55.910 align:start position:0%
medical policy that you would put in
place

02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
so i think we would be this
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
is my opinion
 
02:21:00.150 --> 02:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
that it would need to pass the other
 
02:21:01.750 --> 02:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
committee first and then come this
 
02:21:01.760 --> 02:21:02.790 align:start position:0%
committee first and then come this
direction

02:21:02.790 --> 02:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
direction
 
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
considering it was a non-germane
 
02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:06.550 align:start position:0%
considering it was a non-germane
amendment

02:21:06.550 --> 02:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:08.150 align:start position:0%
amendment
the

02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
other committee was free to take up that
 
02:21:11.429 --> 02:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
issue at any time
 
02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
on their own without any
 
02:21:16.710 --> 02:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
comment or influence from this committee
 
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
so i thank you i i tend to agree that
 
02:21:23.429 --> 02:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
this is really to decriminalize the
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
possession and
 
02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
i think that's a conversation that we're
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
going to have in the state but
 
02:21:31.590 --> 02:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
i think with cannabis moving forward
 
02:21:33.750 --> 02:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
it might be too much too soon
 
02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:34.550 align:start position:0%
it might be too much too soon
and

02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:35.910 --> 02:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
i would say if we don't have a cannabis
 
02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
policy in place at least you know
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
recreation this might i don't see this
 
02:21:42.150 --> 02:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
making it very far i think it it's
 
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
raised enough awareness got us all
 
02:21:45.670 --> 02:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
thinking but in this bill i think this

interim study
 
02:22:07.110 --> 02:22:07.120 align:start position:0%

at this time we'll now close the

executive session
 
02:25:23.110 --> 02:25:23.120 align:start position:0%

02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:59.190 align:start position:0%
 
now

02:25:59.190 --> 02:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:24.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:26:24.870 --> 02:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:34.070 --> 02:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative burt i was just wondering
 
02:26:36.389 --> 02:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
if you've heard anything about friday i
 
02:26:37.990 --> 02:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
know it's a shocker but i think we're
 
02:26:40.630 --> 02:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
going to get some snow in new hampshire
 
02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
so and i have a subcommittee and i would
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
love to attend it but
 
02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
i know they like canceling stuff
 
02:26:49.429 --> 02:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the all the
 
02:26:51.190 --> 02:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearings on friday will
 
02:26:52.469 --> 02:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
will be canceled
 
02:27:00.309 --> 02:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:02.950 --> 02:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
so what i would recommend
 
02:27:04.230 --> 02:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
for any of the subcommittee hearings the
 
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
next date we'll be here would be the
 
02:27:07.830 --> 02:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
following wednesday
 
02:27:10.070 --> 02:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
and uh we would if anything want to put
 
02:27:11.510 --> 02:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
those on in the morning
 
02:27:13.030 --> 02:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
and i would say any bills that we have
 
02:27:15.670 --> 02:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
not held an exec on by the end of the
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
day today we should likely be
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:59.750 --> 02:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
at this time we'll now open the
 
02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:08.070 --> 02:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's at 11 the next hearing public
 
02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
hearing is scheduled for 11 30. so we
 
02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:14.389 align:start position:0%
hearing is scheduled for 11 30. so we
have

02:28:14.389 --> 02:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:19.270 --> 02:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
this time when i open the executive
 
02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
session on cacr 34 the use
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:08.710 --> 02:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative testman do you wish to be
 
02:29:16.710 --> 02:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:17.990 align:start position:0%
 
second

02:29:17.990 --> 02:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
that has been seconded by
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
02:29:22.469 --> 02:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
representative tusman do you wish to
 
02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:32.790 --> 02:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:34.389 --> 02:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we have a lot of other
 
02:29:57.990 --> 02:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:01.349 --> 02:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
any any of the members wish to speak
 
02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:07.590 --> 02:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
i intend to support the itl motion as
 
02:30:09.830 --> 02:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
well as the itl motions for
 
02:30:11.670 --> 02:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
the other cannabis constitutional
 
02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:13.349 align:start position:0%
the other cannabis constitutional
amendments

02:30:13.349 --> 02:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
i don't feel that the use of cannabis
 
02:30:18.710 --> 02:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
arises to a constitutional issue
 
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
i think our constitution is for more
 
02:30:23.670 --> 02:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
more critical things
 
02:30:23.680 --> 02:30:25.030 align:start position:0%
more critical things
and

02:30:25.030 --> 02:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:27.270 --> 02:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
the regulation of cannabis
 
02:30:29.270 --> 02:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
should be a matter for the legislature
 
02:30:30.550 --> 02:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
to decide
 
02:30:31.910 --> 02:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we need to put this
 
02:30:39.670 --> 02:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:42.389 --> 02:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised
 
02:30:46.790 --> 02:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:48.790 --> 02:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
only because i think it's time we stop
 
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
 footing around on cannabis
 
02:30:54.870 --> 02:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
i will support the constitutional
 
02:30:56.790 --> 02:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
amendment the proposed constitutional
 
02:30:56.800 --> 02:30:58.830 align:start position:0%
amendment the proposed constitutional
amendment

02:30:58.830 --> 02:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
um let the people decide i don't see any
 
02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
harm in that just
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
i i think there's there's probably
 
02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh
 
02:31:11.750 --> 02:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
opposed constitutional amendments having
 
02:31:13.990 --> 02:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
to do with this
 
02:31:15.830 --> 02:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
maybe that's too many for the people to
 
02:31:17.110 --> 02:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
decide on
 
02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:19.270 align:start position:0%

and i believe that the sponsor of the

bill is unavailable so if there's any
 
02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
if there's any member that would simply
 
02:34:29.349 --> 02:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
just introduce the bill that no

02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:23.750 align:start position:0%
and i see this as an anti-self defense
bill

02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
basically the the one of the worst parts
 
02:36:29.429 --> 02:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
of it is line 22 a
 
02:36:31.590 --> 02:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
basically is trying to remove the
 
02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
limited stand your ground protection new
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire has new hampshire truly
 
02:36:36.550 --> 02:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have stand your ground
 
02:36:39.030 --> 02:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
protection it should have but it doesn't
 
02:36:40.230 --> 02:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
but this
 
02:36:42.469 --> 02:36:42.479 align:start position:0%
by or anywhere he or she has a right to
 
02:36:47.030 --> 02:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
be by striking out that provision of 627
 
02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:48.550 align:start position:0%
be by striking out that provision of 627
1a

02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
1a
 
02:36:52.389 --> 02:36:52.399 align:start position:0%
and 20 7 4 3 a
 
02:36:55.110 --> 02:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
basically removes tons of self-defense
 
02:36:56.950 --> 02:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
protections that we do need we actually
 
02:36:59.349 --> 02:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
need more in this state
 
02:37:01.429 --> 02:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
and i respectfully would say that alone
 
02:37:03.110 --> 02:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
should be enough to i tell it but it
 
02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're already there i just
 
02:37:07.190 --> 02:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
have seen bills flop and take different
 
02:37:09.270 --> 02:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
procedural paths and i want to make sure
 
02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
that this bill hopefully is dead on
 
02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:12.950 align:start position:0%
that this bill hopefully is dead on
arrival

02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
arrival
 
02:37:15.270 --> 02:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
there are many other provisions in it
 
02:37:16.830 --> 02:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
that are
 
02:37:20.389 --> 02:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
problematic and if you look at 6271a
 
02:37:22.870 --> 02:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
which is found on line 12
 
02:37:24.469 --> 02:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
of the first page
 
02:37:25.990 --> 02:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
they want to remove protection of
 
02:37:29.110 --> 02:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
premises and property pursuant to 6 27 7
 
02:37:31.910 --> 02:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
and 6 27 8. i guess that means burglars
 
02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
can come in your house and tear things
 
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
apart and maybe tear you apart and hey
 
02:37:37.270 --> 02:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
you can just leave your house and let
 
02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
them have at it
 
02:37:40.389 --> 02:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that's where we want
 
02:37:41.590 --> 02:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
because anybody who is so crazy to break
 
02:37:45.590 --> 02:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
in your house or come in your house
 
02:37:47.349 --> 02:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
in addition to tearing your property up
 
02:37:49.270 --> 02:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
your body may be next
 
02:37:51.270 --> 02:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
and so i'm happy to answer mechanical
 
02:37:53.429 --> 02:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
questions but here's the thing that the
 
02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
committee has to know and this is
 
02:37:57.750 --> 02:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
something that as a trial lawyer
 
02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
frustrates me and just brings me to
 
02:38:01.510 --> 02:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
tears actually
 
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not a trial judge will allow
 
02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
an affirmative defense of self-defense
 
02:38:07.590 --> 02:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
to be raised is totally up to the trial
 
02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:08.710 align:start position:0%
to be raised is totally up to the trial
judge

02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
judge
 
02:38:10.469 --> 02:38:10.479 align:start position:0%
people think that you can raise it yeah
 
02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
your lawyer can raise it you raise
 
02:38:13.910 --> 02:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
emotion you bring up the facts but the
 
02:38:16.469 --> 02:38:16.479 align:start position:0%
trial judge determines whether or not
 
02:38:18.309 --> 02:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
that's actually going to be raised or
 
02:38:20.710 --> 02:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
heard by the jury and to what level and
 
02:38:22.469 --> 02:38:22.479 align:start position:0%
that's a really really big deal if
 
02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
you're the one sitting in the
 
02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
defendant's chair
 
02:38:27.590 --> 02:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
the other issue is
 
02:38:29.830 --> 02:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
02:38:31.030 --> 02:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
there's going to be any further
 
02:38:32.630 --> 02:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
protections added because here's the
 
02:38:33.990 --> 02:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
thing that you have to remember in this
 
02:38:36.469 --> 02:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
state we do not elect judges and that's
 
02:38:38.550 --> 02:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
a big deal trial judges in the majority
 
02:38:40.630 --> 02:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
of states in this country are elected
 
02:38:42.870 --> 02:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
which means you can unelect them when

you know just removes too much
to

02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire
 
02:40:32.710 --> 02:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
really any state
 
02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:34.399 align:start position:0%

and uh that's it you know we need those
 
02:40:44.070 --> 02:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
protections this bill would remove them
 
02:40:45.990 --> 02:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why i support the itl and
 
02:40:51.510 --> 02:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:55.590 --> 02:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:58.630 --> 02:40:58.640 align:start position:0%

declined to show up
 
02:41:03.349 --> 02:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
i support the intent of the bill
 
02:41:04.950 --> 02:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
because basically
 
02:41:07.110 --> 02:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
i did not support the expansion of stand
 
02:41:08.790 --> 02:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
your ground
 
02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
in other sessions of this committee and
 
02:41:12.550 --> 02:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
did not vote for it when it came up
 
02:41:14.389 --> 02:41:14.399 align:start position:0%
before the legislature
 
02:41:17.830 --> 02:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
this would unwind it and i support it
 
02:41:20.150 --> 02:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
but i do not support the itl
 
02:41:22.389 --> 02:41:22.399 align:start position:0%

this bill
 
04:04:37.670 --> 04:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
they said uh they have tried it up in
 
04:04:41.510 --> 04:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:43.429 --> 04:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
you know matter of fact one person said
 
04:04:45.590 --> 04:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
that it seems like there's more people
 
04:04:46.950 --> 04:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
hunting on
 
04:04:46.960 --> 04:04:47.990 align:start position:0%
hunting on
the

04:04:47.990 --> 04:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:04:50.550 --> 04:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
partials that are painted purple
 
04:04:53.030 --> 04:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
because people don't understand in this
 
04:04:53.040 --> 04:04:53.990 align:start position:0%
because people don't understand in this
area

04:04:53.990 --> 04:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
area
 
04:04:56.229 --> 04:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing you know to
 
04:04:58.070 --> 04:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
what purple means
 
04:05:00.150 --> 04:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing that
 
04:05:03.189 --> 04:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
i'm opposed to this is new hampshire and
 
04:05:05.189 --> 04:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
pretty much new england
 
04:05:07.189 --> 04:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
is unique
 
04:05:09.750 --> 04:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
we have it's called uh if i get the word
 
04:05:12.070 --> 04:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
right common land
 
04:05:14.309 --> 04:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
so you could own 500 acres or a thousand
 
04:05:16.550 --> 04:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
acres or whatever it is
 
04:05:19.910 --> 04:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
and your neighbors can just walk on it
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
now if you want to post it you can
 
04:05:26.870 --> 04:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:26.880 --> 04:05:28.870 align:start position:0%
 
because

04:05:28.870 --> 04:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:05:31.590 --> 04:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know down south
 
04:05:33.670 --> 04:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
in some of the states and i understand
 
04:05:35.670 --> 04:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
also a little bit out west
 
04:05:37.670 --> 04:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know some states it you know it's
 
04:05:39.189 --> 04:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
pretty much it's not
 
04:05:41.429 --> 04:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
everything is posted even without signs
 
04:05:44.309 --> 04:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
so you have to get permission
 
04:05:44.319 --> 04:05:45.429 align:start position:0%
so you have to get permission
where

04:05:45.429 --> 04:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:05:47.189 --> 04:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
you know this came from
 
04:05:49.429 --> 04:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
you know when england we came over from
 
04:05:51.990 --> 04:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
england and we started
 
04:05:53.429 --> 04:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
moving around
 
04:05:55.429 --> 04:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
this is just stuck for hundreds of years
 
04:05:57.910 --> 04:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
that allow us to walk on somebody's
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
property that is not posted
 
04:06:02.309 --> 04:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
you know without trespassing
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
and i think this bill would just cloud
 
04:06:05.279 --> 04:06:07.030 align:start position:0%
and i think this bill would just cloud
up

04:06:07.030 --> 04:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
the current situation we have which i
 
04:06:12.790 --> 04:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
support and i hope you support the itl
 
04:06:14.950 --> 04:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
and again you know there's three
 
04:06:16.150 --> 04:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh major
 
04:06:19.510 --> 04:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
landowners uh groups that um
 
04:06:21.349 --> 04:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
you know oppose this
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
and i just see no value in this bill so
 
04:06:28.950 --> 04:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:31.030 --> 04:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative boarding
 
04:06:33.269 --> 04:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
thank you chair i'm going to oppose the
 
04:06:35.030 --> 04:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
ito motion
 
04:06:37.349 --> 04:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
i think that the amendment that we have
 
04:06:40.950 --> 04:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
not heard and uh
 
04:06:43.910 --> 04:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
produces a hybrid
 
04:06:47.110 --> 04:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
posting which would make it easier for
 
04:06:51.510 --> 04:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:51.520 --> 04:06:53.349 align:start position:0%
 
do

04:06:53.349 --> 04:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:06:55.030 --> 04:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
and maintain
 
04:06:55.040 --> 04:06:57.670 align:start position:0%
and maintain
um

04:06:57.670 --> 04:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:00.950 --> 04:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
so for that reason that reason alone i
 
04:07:05.189 --> 04:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
consider it uh an advantage for uh
 
04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
property owners that
 
04:07:09.910 --> 04:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
want to post their land
 
04:07:12.309 --> 04:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
i was not happy with part of the
 
04:07:15.510 --> 04:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that was offered by
 
04:07:17.750 --> 04:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative roy and that was because
 
04:07:21.110 --> 04:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
of the penalty was a felony and i did
 
04:07:24.550 --> 04:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
not like that but i think that this has
 
04:07:24.560 --> 04:07:25.349 align:start position:0%
not like that but i think that this has
a

04:07:25.349 --> 04:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:07:26.790 --> 04:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
has merit
 
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
it would
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
allow posting of uh land in the current
 
04:07:32.000 --> 04:07:33.510 align:start position:0%
allow posting of uh land in the current
way

04:07:33.510 --> 04:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:07:33.520 --> 04:07:34.309 align:start position:0%
way
but

04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:07:35.349 --> 04:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
not as
 
04:07:40.149 --> 04:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh frequently as every 100 yards but
 
04:07:43.750 --> 04:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
except for using purple paint and
 
04:07:45.349 --> 04:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
the posting
 
04:07:45.359 --> 04:07:46.790 align:start position:0%
the posting
of

04:07:46.790 --> 04:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:07:50.389 --> 04:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
of the day would be ever 250 yards
 
04:07:52.070 --> 04:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
so i think that
 
04:07:55.030 --> 04:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
this bill has a lot of merit and i'm not
 
04:07:56.950 --> 04:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
going to support the itl
 
04:08:00.149 --> 04:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:02.950 --> 04:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
04:08:04.309 --> 04:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i would like to
 
04:08:06.550 --> 04:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
associate myself with the remarks my
 
04:08:08.950 --> 04:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
good friend representative bordenay
 
04:08:11.590 --> 04:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
um i i think that there is um my
 
04:08:15.269 --> 04:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
constituents have who are landowners
 
04:08:17.429 --> 04:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
i i represent deerfield nottingham
 
04:08:17.439 --> 04:08:18.550 align:start position:0%
i i represent deerfield nottingham
northwood

04:08:18.550 --> 04:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
northwood
 
04:08:21.830 --> 04:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
candia soon auburn
 
04:08:23.429 --> 04:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
they own a lot of property there's some
 
04:08:24.870 --> 04:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
of them are senior citizens and they
 
04:08:27.189 --> 04:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
just see some merit and not having to to
 
04:08:28.870 --> 04:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
either hire somebody or find a way to
 
04:08:31.269 --> 04:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
get around their entire acreage every
 
04:08:34.389 --> 04:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
year to replace damaged signs
 
04:08:36.630 --> 04:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
and like i said my constituents have
 
04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
asked for it and i am here for no other
 
04:08:42.389 --> 04:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
reason than to represent them so i am
 
04:08:45.030 --> 04:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
advocating for this bill to not be itl
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
representative harry gathered
 
04:08:56.950 --> 04:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay one of the um thank you um chair
 
04:08:58.389 --> 04:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
one of the things that helped me with
 
04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:09:01.349 --> 04:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
a document that we see from the division
 
04:09:03.189 --> 04:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
of forests and lands
 
04:09:04.710 --> 04:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
it was
 
04:09:06.550 --> 04:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
patrick hackley director of new
 
04:09:09.030 --> 04:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire division of forest land
 
04:09:10.870 --> 04:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
and he says that the purple boundary
 
04:09:10.880 --> 04:09:12.630 align:start position:0%
and he says that the purple boundary
paint

04:09:12.630 --> 04:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
paint
 
04:09:15.030 --> 04:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
to indicate no trespassing is an
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
uncommon practice in the northeast
 
04:09:19.830 --> 04:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
and is not widely recognized recognized
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
by the majority of the landowners
 
04:09:23.830 --> 04:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
foresters surveyors and forest
 
04:09:23.840 --> 04:09:25.269 align:start position:0%
foresters surveyors and forest
recreationists

04:09:25.269 --> 04:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
recreationists
 
04:09:27.189 --> 04:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
posted signs are well recognized and can
 
04:09:30.389 --> 04:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
be easily added or removed as landlord
 
04:09:31.990 --> 04:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
owners desire
 
04:09:34.469 --> 04:09:34.479 align:start position:0%
or ownership change as opposed to
 
04:09:37.750 --> 04:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
essentially permanent paint markings
 
04:09:39.750 --> 04:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
he also goes on to say that
 
04:09:42.469 --> 04:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
there are well established time-tested
 
04:09:45.510 --> 04:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
standards for boundary markings used by
 
04:09:48.309 --> 04:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
licensed surveyors and foresters that
 
04:09:50.469 --> 04:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
are more effective than those proposed
 
04:09:52.469 --> 04:09:52.479 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
04:09:59.590 --> 04:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:02.149 --> 04:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
04:10:03.670 --> 04:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'll be opposing
 
04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
the itl
 
04:10:08.229 --> 04:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
so traditions are important the
 
04:10:11.349 --> 04:10:11.359 align:start position:0%
tradition of allowing anyone onto your
 
04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
land unless it's posted that goes back a
 
04:10:15.269 --> 04:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
long time
 
04:10:17.110 --> 04:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
one thing i think is
 
04:10:19.189 --> 04:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
one of many things that are that trump
 
04:10:21.830 --> 04:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
tradition are property rights
 
04:10:23.670 --> 04:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
property rights
 
04:10:26.710 --> 04:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
so this is a the current tradition is a
 
04:10:29.030 --> 04:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
diminishment of property rights it tells
 
04:10:32.309 --> 04:10:32.319 align:start position:0%
a landowner they must do something incur
 
04:10:33.510 --> 04:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
a cost
 
04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
or anyone can access their property at
 
04:10:38.229 --> 04:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
any time
 
04:10:39.750 --> 04:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:10:39.760 --> 04:10:40.950 align:start position:0%
this bill
purple

04:10:40.950 --> 04:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
purple
 
04:10:43.830 --> 04:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
green orange whatever color
 
04:10:46.389 --> 04:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh i would expect a hunter
 
04:10:47.670 --> 04:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
to know
 
04:10:49.670 --> 04:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
what that means if the law were to
 
04:10:52.389 --> 04:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
change it's not onerous
 
04:10:54.149 --> 04:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
and property owners should have choice
 
04:10:55.830 --> 04:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
in how they mark their property thank
 
04:10:55.840 --> 04:11:00.790 align:start position:0%
in how they mark their property thank
you

04:11:00.790 --> 04:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:00.800 --> 04:11:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:11:01.830 --> 04:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:03.110 --> 04:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just gonna
 
04:11:06.790 --> 04:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:08.550 --> 04:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
the iron needs a purple book but this is
 
04:11:11.830 --> 04:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
what we have here i'll just explain that
 
04:11:13.269 --> 04:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
in when you're dealing with criminal
 
04:11:13.279 --> 04:11:14.550 align:start position:0%
in when you're dealing with criminal
trespassing

04:11:14.550 --> 04:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
trespassing
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
a person is guilty of criminal trespass
 
04:11:16.560 --> 04:11:17.269 align:start position:0%
a person is guilty of criminal trespass
if

04:11:17.269 --> 04:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:11:18.870 --> 04:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
knowing that he is not licensed or
 
04:11:21.110 --> 04:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
privileged to do so enters or remains in
 
04:11:23.590 --> 04:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
any place
 
04:11:25.910 --> 04:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
so knowingly a person acts knowingly
 
04:11:27.670 --> 04:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
with respect to conduct or to the
 
04:11:29.429 --> 04:11:29.439 align:start position:0%
circumstances that is
 
04:11:30.950 --> 04:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
a material element
 
04:11:33.110 --> 04:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
of an offense when he is aware that his
 
04:11:35.750 --> 04:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
conduct is of such a nature or that such
 
04:11:37.590 --> 04:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances exist
 
04:11:39.750 --> 04:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
so in order to it's one thing to have
 
04:11:42.070 --> 04:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
the purple paint uh essentially replace
 
04:11:42.080 --> 04:11:43.269 align:start position:0%
the purple paint uh essentially replace
the

04:11:43.269 --> 04:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:11:46.469 --> 04:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:48.630 --> 04:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
the person would have to know what the
 
04:11:51.429 --> 04:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
purple line of paint means
 
04:11:51.439 --> 04:11:52.790 align:start position:0%
purple line of paint means
and

04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:55.110 --> 04:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
i said this earlier today
 
04:11:56.630 --> 04:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
some of some of the members here
 
04:11:56.640 --> 04:11:57.670 align:start position:0%
some of some of the members here
privately

04:11:57.670 --> 04:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
privately
 
04:11:59.110 --> 04:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
that this is one of the few policies
 
04:12:00.630 --> 04:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
that i believe the state would be better
 
04:12:01.990 --> 04:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
served being one of the last states to
 
04:12:02.870 --> 04:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
do it
 
04:12:02.880 --> 04:12:03.830 align:start position:0%
do it
because

04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:12:06.149 --> 04:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
the enforceability side
 
04:12:07.429 --> 04:12:07.439 align:start position:0%
if a person does not know what that
 
04:12:08.469 --> 04:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
means i mean
 
04:12:09.830 --> 04:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think any of that defense would
 
04:12:11.189 --> 04:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
work with us because we're all here on
 
04:12:12.790 --> 04:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:12:13.830 --> 04:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
but if you don't know what the purple
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
line means you can't prosecute you can't
 
04:12:17.990 --> 04:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
enforce it and we heard that was a
 
04:12:19.590 --> 04:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
problem in maine
 
04:12:21.429 --> 04:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
and the way new hampshire's law is now
 
04:12:24.309 --> 04:12:24.319 align:start position:0%
if your land doesn't say no trespassing
 
04:12:24.319 --> 04:12:25.670 align:start position:0%
if your land doesn't say no trespassing
people

04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:12:25.680 --> 04:12:27.030 align:start position:0%
people
are

04:12:27.030 --> 04:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:12:28.630 --> 04:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
free to enter it for hunting for hunting
 
04:12:30.790 --> 04:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
purposes now it's common practice that
 
04:12:31.990 --> 04:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
you still
 
04:12:33.429 --> 04:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
hunters will generally talk to the land
 
04:12:34.950 --> 04:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
owner but
 
04:12:36.630 --> 04:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
it's not a requirement
 
04:12:37.830 --> 04:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
because i'm not aware of it being a
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
requirement so i'm just explaining that
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
for me
 
04:12:42.149 --> 04:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
this is really an enforceability side
 
04:12:44.950 --> 04:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
the policy itself is not the issue
 
04:12:46.870 --> 04:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:12:48.229 --> 04:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
there's no restriction on the type of
 
04:12:49.590 --> 04:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
paints you use there could be
 
04:12:53.110 --> 04:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
this is things that things to think
 
04:12:54.479 --> 04:12:55.269 align:start position:0%
this is things that things to think
about

04:12:55.269 --> 04:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:12:57.670 --> 04:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
and this will be back because like i
 
04:12:59.269 --> 04:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
said i think new hampshire's better
 
04:13:00.630 --> 04:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
serve being on the back end it's not the
 
04:13:01.670 --> 04:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
front end
 
04:13:03.429 --> 04:13:03.439 align:start position:0%
i don't see this being a huge problem in
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
the state that we're fixing or solving
 
04:13:07.590 --> 04:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
by passing this
 
04:13:10.229 --> 04:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
so frankly i'll be honest i would have
 
04:13:11.670 --> 04:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
no idea if i did not sit on this
 
04:13:12.870 --> 04:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
committee i would have no idea what the
 
04:13:16.469 --> 04:13:16.479 align:start position:0%
purple painted tree meant
 
04:13:16.479 --> 04:13:17.590 align:start position:0%
purple painted tree meant
so

04:13:17.590 --> 04:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
and that would that defense would
 
04:13:20.870 --> 04:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
actually work because i'm not aware so
 
04:13:22.950 --> 04:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
once someone explains it's different so
 
04:13:25.269 --> 04:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
the other part of it is is
 
04:13:27.110 --> 04:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
you can grant people access it it's kind
 
04:13:28.469 --> 04:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
of hard to remove the purple paint where
 
04:13:30.070 --> 04:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
the sign is easy to remove so there's
 
04:13:33.030 --> 04:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
that problem too once it's on the tree
 
04:13:34.870 --> 04:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
so i will be supporting the
 
04:13:37.590 --> 04:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
motion of nxp to legislate and i
 
04:13:39.189 --> 04:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
hope and welcome
 
04:13:42.229 --> 04:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:44.870 --> 04:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative representative roy
 
04:13:47.349 --> 04:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
i would just a couple quick points
 
04:13:52.469 --> 04:13:52.479 align:start position:0%
as far as education it's a matter of
 
04:13:54.149 --> 04:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
when you get your renew your hunting
 
04:13:56.149 --> 04:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
license having a slip of paper that
 
04:13:58.229 --> 04:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
explains the purple paint um
 
04:14:00.309 --> 04:14:00.319 align:start position:0%
as we all know the ignorance of the law
 
04:14:03.429 --> 04:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
is not an excuse to break the law
 
04:14:05.349 --> 04:14:05.359 align:start position:0%
furthermore there'd be
 
04:14:07.590 --> 04:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
enormous press coverage
 
04:14:10.149 --> 04:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
it would be well known to the public but
 
04:14:13.590 --> 04:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:21.110 --> 04:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
many laws we change every year don't
 
04:14:21.120 --> 04:14:23.750 align:start position:0%
many laws we change every year don't
um

04:14:23.750 --> 04:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:26.469 --> 04:14:26.479 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily make it to the the
 
04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
public's at large view for a while i
 
04:14:31.590 --> 04:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
mean if we took that that um tact with
 
04:14:34.070 --> 04:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
every law we pass we might as well never
 
04:14:35.510 --> 04:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
pass a law because nobody would know
 
04:14:37.910 --> 04:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
about it so i i don't think that's a a
 
04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
good argument against it
 
04:14:39.920 --> 04:14:41.110 align:start position:0%
good argument against it
um

04:14:41.110 --> 04:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
i think that the compromise um was good
 
04:14:45.830 --> 04:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
i think it helps homeowners and again i
 
04:14:48.070 --> 04:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
would reiterate my request that um the
 
04:14:55.990 --> 04:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative roy
 
04:15:01.510 --> 04:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr representative boardney
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to point out one thing
 
04:15:05.830 --> 04:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
the purple painting doesn't mean
 
04:15:08.469 --> 04:15:08.479 align:start position:0%
anything without the traditional posting
 
04:15:10.630 --> 04:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
so if you take the po if you thought the
 
04:15:12.630 --> 04:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
landowner decides that
 
04:15:12.640 --> 04:15:13.510 align:start position:0%
landowner decides that
hey

04:15:13.510 --> 04:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
hey
 
04:15:15.910 --> 04:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know the hunters are okay
 
04:15:17.830 --> 04:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
i don't mind people trespassing on my
 
04:15:20.710 --> 04:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
property all he has to do is take down
 
04:15:23.189 --> 04:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
the traditional posting because the
 
04:15:25.590 --> 04:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
purple paint doesn't mean anything
 
04:15:28.229 --> 04:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
without the traditional posting
 
04:15:28.239 --> 04:15:29.110 align:start position:0%
without the traditional posting
so

04:15:29.110 --> 04:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:31.670 --> 04:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
i i think it's
 
04:15:33.910 --> 04:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
is a great idea thank you
 
04:15:33.920 --> 04:15:34.870 align:start position:0%
is a great idea thank you
okay

04:15:34.870 --> 04:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:15:36.630 --> 04:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
can i ask though if you have the
 
04:15:37.990 --> 04:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
traditional posting why do you need the
 
04:15:41.670 --> 04:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:44.469 --> 04:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh is that a question for me yes
 
04:15:47.429 --> 04:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
because it's easier to execute and you
 
04:15:49.269 --> 04:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
don't have to to
 
04:15:51.750 --> 04:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
execute it on an annual basis so it's
 
04:15:54.630 --> 04:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
cheaper for the property owner to to
 
04:15:57.590 --> 04:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
carry out and it's uh
 
04:15:57.600 --> 04:15:59.590 align:start position:0%
carry out and it's uh
easier

04:15:59.590 --> 04:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
easier
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
but what i'm saying is if you need the
 
04:16:03.110 --> 04:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
purple paint
 
04:16:04.710 --> 04:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
if you need purple paint and you have to
 
04:16:06.469 --> 04:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
have the traditional posting by having
 
04:16:09.510 --> 04:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
the traditional posting already
 
04:16:11.110 --> 04:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the purple paint not be
 
04:16:12.550 --> 04:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
necessary because it's already
 
04:16:15.269 --> 04:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
traditionally posted okay
 
04:16:18.149 --> 04:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:20.469 --> 04:16:20.479 align:start position:0%
as representative roy presented
 
04:16:23.590 --> 04:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
the hybrid system is a traditional
 
04:16:23.600 --> 04:16:24.630 align:start position:0%
the hybrid system is a traditional
posting

04:16:24.630 --> 04:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
posting
 
04:16:27.670 --> 04:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
every 250 yards instead of every 100
 
04:16:29.349 --> 04:16:29.359 align:start position:0%
yards it is
 
04:16:33.429 --> 04:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
a lot less work but it is still work
 
04:16:33.439 --> 04:16:34.389 align:start position:0%
a lot less work but it is still work
now

04:16:34.389 --> 04:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:16:36.870 --> 04:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
posting with with a purple paint every
 
04:16:40.630 --> 04:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
100 yards in addition to posting on
 
04:16:43.269 --> 04:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
the traditional posting every
 
04:16:47.189 --> 04:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
250 yards is is less of an issue a
 
04:16:47.199 --> 04:16:49.030 align:start position:0%
250 yards is is less of an issue a
problem

04:16:49.030 --> 04:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:16:57.189 --> 04:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:59.110 --> 04:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
04:17:01.189 --> 04:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and ever since
 
04:17:02.950 --> 04:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
we're i guess we're
 
04:17:04.950 --> 04:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
leaning toward talking about the um well
 
04:17:05.990 --> 04:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
i guess we are talking about the
 
04:17:08.550 --> 04:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
amendment if this failed
 
04:17:12.550 --> 04:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
um the amendment does not say
 
04:17:14.389 --> 04:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
spray paint purple paint
 
04:17:14.399 --> 04:17:15.349 align:start position:0%
spray paint purple paint
or

04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:17:19.269 --> 04:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
a tres no trespass sign and or
 
04:17:21.429 --> 04:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
you know so if the purple paint's there
 
04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
it's still no trespass you can take your
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
signs down but it's still no trespass
 
04:17:27.910 --> 04:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't specify
 
04:17:30.149 --> 04:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
either or in my eyes
 
04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
but then also
 
04:17:35.510 --> 04:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
a second offense of
 
04:17:38.550 --> 04:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
spray paint in a tree that is not yours
 
04:17:41.349 --> 04:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
is a felony
 
04:17:43.030 --> 04:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
i can't imagine anybody's going to vote
 
04:17:46.710 --> 04:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
for a felony charge on a second
 
04:17:46.720 --> 04:17:47.910 align:start position:0%
for a felony charge on a second
offense

04:17:47.910 --> 04:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
offense
 
04:17:50.070 --> 04:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
when you go down in manchester and you
 
04:17:53.269 --> 04:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
see all the buildings uh graffitied and
 
04:17:55.110 --> 04:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
billboards are graffitied on the back
 
04:17:56.870 --> 04:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
side of them in the fence you know the
 
04:17:59.670 --> 04:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
big interstate fences they're graffitied
 
04:18:01.349 --> 04:18:01.359 align:start position:0%
i don't think they get a felony for the
 
04:18:03.110 --> 04:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
second third fourth time they get
 
04:18:06.550 --> 04:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
stopped or get caught doing that so i
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
think the crime way more outweighs
 
04:18:12.710 --> 04:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know the the uh the punishment
 
04:18:14.870 --> 04:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
outweighs the crime you know is it wrong
 
04:18:16.469 --> 04:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
to spray paint trees that aren't yours
 
04:18:20.070 --> 04:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
yes but a felony charge
 
04:18:21.830 --> 04:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
you know i just can't go for that so i'm
 
04:18:30.950 --> 04:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:30.960 --> 04:18:32.229 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:18:32.229 --> 04:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:18:33.670 --> 04:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
traditionally when you recognize
 
04:18:35.110 --> 04:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
something to speak you're supposed to
 
04:18:36.630 --> 04:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
let someone who hasn't spoken already
 
04:18:38.550 --> 04:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
yet that's why representative ray newman
 
04:18:38.560 --> 04:18:39.830 align:start position:0%
yet that's why representative ray newman
issue

04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:18:41.670 --> 04:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i wasn't keeping adequate
 
04:18:44.070 --> 04:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
track of who had spoken first
 
04:18:44.080 --> 04:18:45.429 align:start position:0%
track of who had spoken first
um

04:18:45.429 --> 04:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:45.439 --> 04:18:46.550 align:start position:0%
um
i

04:18:46.550 --> 04:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:18:49.269 --> 04:18:49.279 align:start position:0%
i want to say that i agree with my good
 
04:18:49.279 --> 04:18:50.550 align:start position:0%
i want to say that i agree with my good
friend

04:18:50.550 --> 04:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
friend
 
04:18:53.349 --> 04:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
john burt down there about
 
04:18:55.830 --> 04:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
the felony uh crime i'm just not in
 
04:18:57.670 --> 04:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
favor of that
 
04:18:59.590 --> 04:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is that i'm finding
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
it difficult and i assume we are talking
 
04:19:05.429 --> 04:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
about the amendment that was passed out
 
04:19:07.030 --> 04:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
this morning and that's where it is and
 
04:19:08.469 --> 04:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
there's no subsequent amendment
 
04:19:10.229 --> 04:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
forthcoming so
 
04:19:12.790 --> 04:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
i am confused by the wording in section
 
04:19:15.110 --> 04:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
one on where they go and how they go and
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
how you put them out and that kind of
 
04:19:17.590 --> 04:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
stuff so
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:28.229 --> 04:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:30.229 --> 04:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
this time i will move the question if
 
04:19:32.950 --> 04:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
you were in support of the motion of nxp
 
04:19:34.389 --> 04:19:34.399 align:start position:0%

and i'm gonna live by those words and
 
04:24:18.309 --> 04:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:20.469 --> 04:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bart
 
04:24:24.790 --> 04:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:28.149 --> 04:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:30.950 --> 04:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:24:34.149 --> 04:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
yes i'm going to oppose the i.t motion i
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
think that people in prison have
 
04:24:39.429 --> 04:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to change their life
 
04:24:43.910 --> 04:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
around 25 years is a long time and it is
 
04:24:45.750 --> 04:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
possible for
 
04:24:47.510 --> 04:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
prisoners to
 
04:24:47.520 --> 04:24:48.389 align:start position:0%
prisoners to
become

04:24:48.389 --> 04:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
become
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
new people
 
04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:24:52.560 --> 04:24:53.349 align:start position:0%
and um
i

04:24:53.349 --> 04:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
think that they should get a chance to
 
04:24:58.070 --> 04:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
have a parole review after 25 years or
 
04:25:02.550 --> 04:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
even sooner but 25 years is plenty
 
04:25:03.910 --> 04:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:05.670 --> 04:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm just going to make a general
 
04:25:07.990 --> 04:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
point it's it applies to this bill but
 
04:25:12.229 --> 04:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
you look at lines 1 through 24.
 
04:25:14.950 --> 04:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
although without even evaluating or
 
04:25:17.349 --> 04:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
taking a position what those points made
 
04:25:19.030 --> 04:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
those factual points and factual
 
04:25:20.229 --> 04:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
statements have nothing to do with the
 
04:25:21.510 --> 04:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
subject matter what the bill is trying
 
04:25:22.710 --> 04:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
to accomplish
 
04:25:23.830 --> 04:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
i would just
 
04:25:23.840 --> 04:25:25.510 align:start position:0%
i would just
recommend

04:25:25.510 --> 04:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
04:25:27.590 --> 04:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
anyone putting bills in to not have a
 
04:25:28.870 --> 04:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
necessary language like that because
 
04:25:30.950 --> 04:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
they may you may lose support
 
04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
on language like that
 
04:25:34.229 --> 04:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
but ultimately i'm not sure how much
 
04:25:35.670 --> 04:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
you'll gain
 
04:25:37.110 --> 04:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's really the argument to
 
04:25:39.269 --> 04:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
pass it not shouldn't be written in the
 
04:25:39.279 --> 04:25:40.389 align:start position:0%
pass it not shouldn't be written in the
law

04:25:40.389 --> 04:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:25:43.590 --> 04:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
just just a thought but
 
04:25:45.750 --> 04:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
but anyway
 
04:25:47.990 --> 04:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative roy you wish to speak i
 
04:25:49.990 --> 04:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
do thank you i i would agree with
 
04:25:52.149 --> 04:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
representative bordenay in as much as i
 
04:25:54.070 --> 04:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
i agree that um
 
04:25:56.710 --> 04:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
that people incarcerated definitely
 
04:25:59.349 --> 04:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
deserve a second shot in a review and 25
 
04:26:02.309 --> 04:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
years is a long time however the sponsor
 
04:26:03.910 --> 04:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
04:26:06.389 --> 04:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
did not coordinate in my opinion with
 
04:26:06.399 --> 04:26:07.510 align:start position:0%
did not coordinate in my opinion with
the

04:26:07.510 --> 04:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:26:09.269 --> 04:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
department of corrections with the
 
04:26:10.550 --> 04:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
parole board
 
04:26:13.110 --> 04:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
in such a way as to get them
 
04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
their buy-in or at least their their or
 
04:26:16.710 --> 04:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
their understanding what he was trying
 
04:26:17.910 --> 04:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
to do with it
 
04:26:17.920 --> 04:26:18.710 align:start position:0%
to do with it
um

04:26:18.710 --> 04:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:20.550 --> 04:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
and we heard from the parole board we
 
04:26:22.710 --> 04:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
heard from the department of corrections
 
04:26:24.469 --> 04:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
it's a logistical nightmare waiting to
 
04:26:27.030 --> 04:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
happen i think that legislation
 
04:26:29.110 --> 04:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
accomplishing this end and maybe even
 
04:26:32.149 --> 04:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
perhaps more is is far overdue but this
 
04:26:35.590 --> 04:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
is not the vehicle for it um and
 
04:26:37.830 --> 04:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to co-sponsor with anybody
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh next session uh something that would
 
04:26:42.070 --> 04:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
accomplish the similar with with the
 
04:26:44.870 --> 04:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
buy-in and with the cooperation of the
 
04:26:46.630 --> 04:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
all the stakeholders
 
04:26:48.790 --> 04:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
but i can't support this bill as written
 
04:26:54.710 --> 04:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:56.950 --> 04:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative testerman
 
04:26:59.110 --> 04:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
i've heard several bills regarding
 
04:26:59.120 --> 04:27:01.269 align:start position:0%
i've heard several bills regarding
parole

04:27:01.269 --> 04:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
parole
 
04:27:03.269 --> 04:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
in in my time here
 
04:27:03.279 --> 04:27:05.030 align:start position:0%
in in my time here
and

04:27:05.030 --> 04:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:07.030 --> 04:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
i just get the feeling
 
04:27:07.040 --> 04:27:09.269 align:start position:0%
i just get the feeling
that

04:27:09.269 --> 04:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:27:11.269 --> 04:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
we we're not supporting the parole board
 
04:27:11.279 --> 04:27:12.950 align:start position:0%
we we're not supporting the parole board
enough

04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
enough
 
04:27:15.429 --> 04:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
we have rules that countermand each
 
04:27:15.439 --> 04:27:17.110 align:start position:0%
we have rules that countermand each
other

04:27:17.110 --> 04:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:23.910 --> 04:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
i'll go along with the ito because i
 
04:27:25.510 --> 04:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
think we need to do something about the
 
04:27:27.830 --> 04:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
parole board in particular i think
 
04:27:30.870 --> 04:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
they're working hard but i
 
04:27:32.790 --> 04:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's doing a service to
 
04:27:35.349 --> 04:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
the citizens of this of this state
 
04:27:36.950 --> 04:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of what it does for the
 
04:27:36.960 --> 04:27:48.790 align:start position:0%
regardless of what it does for the
prisoners

04:27:48.790 --> 04:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:50.630 --> 04:27:50.640 align:start position:0%

cannabis bills
 
04:32:25.910 --> 04:32:25.920 align:start position:0%

my opposition to this bill uh more has
 
04:32:50.469 --> 04:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:52.550 --> 04:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
did represent roy did you second

yeah sure
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:32:58.710 --> 04:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what's just
 
04:33:01.030 --> 04:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:33:03.189 --> 04:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
all right let me let me correct myself
 
04:33:04.869 --> 04:33:04.879 align:start position:0%
right the motion was made of the next
 
04:33:06.310 --> 04:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
being to legislate by representative
 
04:33:07.750 --> 04:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
testament representative roy do you wish
 
04:33:10.949 --> 04:33:10.959 align:start position:0%

04:33:13.269 --> 04:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
apologies everybody may continue
 
04:33:15.429 --> 04:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
no problem thank you
 
04:33:18.230 --> 04:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's my opposition is more related to
 
04:33:20.949 --> 04:33:20.959 align:start position:0%
the fact that again it's a cacr
 
04:33:23.189 --> 04:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
um i i
 
04:33:25.029 --> 04:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
agree with what representative mew said
 
04:33:26.949 --> 04:33:26.959 align:start position:0%
earlier that that
 
04:33:29.910 --> 04:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendments are much more
 
04:33:31.990 --> 04:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
serious and far-reaching
 
04:33:32.000 --> 04:33:33.510 align:start position:0%
serious and far-reaching
than

04:33:33.510 --> 04:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:33:35.510 --> 04:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
especially within simple you know
 
04:33:38.150 --> 04:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
agriculture issues specific plants i
 
04:33:41.269 --> 04:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
don't believe belong in the constitution
 
04:33:42.789 --> 04:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
i also agree with representative true
 
04:33:44.551 --> 04:33:44.561 align:start position:0%
that the people should decide
 
04:33:46.470 --> 04:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
having said that um
 
04:33:48.551 --> 04:33:48.561 align:start position:0%
we can't put every single thing in front
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
of the people to decide um that's why
 
04:33:52.869 --> 04:33:52.879 align:start position:0%
they sent us here as kind of goalies to
 
04:33:54.709 --> 04:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
screen some of this stuff
 
04:33:57.189 --> 04:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
and um i think we do have several bills
 
04:33:58.949 --> 04:33:58.959 align:start position:0%
in front of the house and some in the
 
04:34:01.590 --> 04:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
senate dealing with the same subject and
 
04:34:03.830 --> 04:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
i just don't think that the opening the
 
04:34:03.840 --> 04:34:04.869 align:start position:0%
i just don't think that the opening the
uh

04:34:04.869 --> 04:34:04.879 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:34:07.990 --> 04:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
the constitution is a place for this so
 
04:34:12.869 --> 04:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:14.709 --> 04:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
04:34:16.230 --> 04:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:34:17.349 --> 04:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
04:34:19.189 --> 04:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
generally with what representative muse
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
said with the last cacr as well although
 
04:34:22.709 --> 04:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
that one had problems that i won't get
 
04:34:23.670 --> 04:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
into but
 
04:34:23.680 --> 04:34:24.789 align:start position:0%
into but
um

04:34:24.789 --> 04:34:24.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:27.349 --> 04:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
we have bills before the house
 
04:34:29.029 --> 04:34:29.039 align:start position:0%
they're going through the process and we
 
04:34:30.789 --> 04:34:30.799 align:start position:0%
know that process tends to run into
 
04:34:33.189 --> 04:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
hurdles in the other chamber
 
04:34:34.230 --> 04:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
we don't know what's going to happen
 
04:34:35.830 --> 04:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
with this bill but if we are going to
 
04:34:38.150 --> 04:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
bring a cacr forward
 
04:34:40.629 --> 04:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
i would recommend this as the simplest
 
04:34:40.639 --> 04:34:41.590 align:start position:0%
i would recommend this as the simplest
one

04:34:41.590 --> 04:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:34:42.709 --> 04:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
this would
 
04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
this was written by the democratic
 
04:34:46.390 --> 04:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
leader the former chair of this
 
04:34:46.400 --> 04:34:47.429 align:start position:0%
leader the former chair of this
committee

04:34:47.429 --> 04:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:34:49.910 --> 04:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's extremely simple in its purpose and
 
04:34:51.990 --> 04:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
it would provide
 
04:34:52.000 --> 04:34:52.830 align:start position:0%
it would provide
this

04:34:52.830 --> 04:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:34:55.189 --> 04:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
legislature in the next term
 
04:34:59.349 --> 04:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
with a clear mandate to get this passed
 
04:35:00.949 --> 04:35:00.959 align:start position:0%
doesn't stipulate how it would come
 
04:35:00.959 --> 04:35:01.990 align:start position:0%
doesn't stipulate how it would come
forward

04:35:01.990 --> 04:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:35:03.109 --> 04:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
it would still come before the
 
04:35:03.119 --> 04:35:05.750 align:start position:0%
it would still come before the
legislature

04:35:05.750 --> 04:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:35:05.760 --> 04:35:06.709 align:start position:0%
legislature
and

04:35:06.709 --> 04:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:08.789 --> 04:35:08.799 align:start position:0%
given the track record of the other body
 
04:35:08.799 --> 04:35:09.830 align:start position:0%
given the track record of the other body
of

04:35:09.830 --> 04:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:35:12.629 --> 04:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
uh to borrow a phrase playing goalie on
 
04:35:14.869 --> 04:35:14.879 align:start position:0%
um cannabis bills i think that this
 
04:35:16.470 --> 04:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
would be something that we could get
 
04:35:18.310 --> 04:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
before the people get it on the record
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
and get this chamber
 
04:35:27.750 --> 04:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:29.670 --> 04:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
04:35:32.070 --> 04:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman mr chairman i will
 
04:35:34.150 --> 04:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
be supporting the itl of this bill i
 
04:35:37.590 --> 04:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
believe in letting the voters have
 
04:35:39.990 --> 04:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
the option and we've already done that
 
04:35:43.349 --> 04:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:46.230 --> 04:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
i did vote against the
 
04:35:49.429 --> 04:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
itl i believe it was itl on that motion
 
04:35:52.470 --> 04:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
but this motion i will support
 
04:35:54.709 --> 04:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
because we already gave them an option
 
04:36:05.670 --> 04:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:05.680 --> 04:36:06.551 align:start position:0%
 
just

04:36:06.551 --> 04:36:06.561 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:36:08.709 --> 04:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
to clarify what this would do it all
 
04:36:10.070 --> 04:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
adults shall have the right to possess
 
04:36:11.670 --> 04:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis intended for their personal
 
04:36:11.680 --> 04:36:13.510 align:start position:0%
cannabis intended for their personal
consumption

04:36:13.510 --> 04:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
consumption
 
04:36:13.520 --> 04:36:14.869 align:start position:0%
consumption
now

04:36:14.869 --> 04:36:14.879 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:36:17.510 --> 04:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
on the way as written
 
04:36:21.349 --> 04:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:23.349 --> 04:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
you can have 200 pounds
 
04:36:25.189 --> 04:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
as long as it's intended
 
04:36:27.910 --> 04:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
for personal consumption
 
04:36:29.990 --> 04:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
this would basically
 
04:36:32.390 --> 04:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's yes it's very simply written but it
 
04:36:34.150 --> 04:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
would basically
 
04:36:36.390 --> 04:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
bar virtually any type of regulation for
 
04:36:39.029 --> 04:36:39.039 align:start position:0%
it at least the way i read it
 
04:36:40.310 --> 04:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
this is something that will be subject
 
04:36:41.830 --> 04:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
to court interpretation now i could be
 
04:36:41.840 --> 04:36:42.869 align:start position:0%
to court interpretation now i could be
wrong

04:36:42.869 --> 04:36:42.879 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:36:45.269 --> 04:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
people may not agree with that
 
04:36:46.789 --> 04:36:46.799 align:start position:0%
but all adults have a right to possess
 
04:36:48.310 --> 04:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis intended for their personal
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
consumption with i don't see there's any
 
04:36:53.990 --> 04:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
room for any
 
04:36:56.230 --> 04:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
capacity limit or possession limits on
 
04:36:56.240 --> 04:36:57.670 align:start position:0%
capacity limit or possession limits on
that

04:36:57.670 --> 04:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:36:59.269 --> 04:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's growing
 
04:37:02.789 --> 04:37:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:05.269 --> 04:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
ph thc levels i mean even if you did
 
04:37:07.109 --> 04:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
make a
 
04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
personal consumption of
 
04:37:11.189 --> 04:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
people different individuals have
 
04:37:13.189 --> 04:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
take different amounts to have different
 
04:37:13.199 --> 04:37:15.189 align:start position:0%
take different amounts to have different
effects

04:37:15.189 --> 04:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
effects
 
04:37:17.910 --> 04:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's it seems just how do you
 
04:37:19.910 --> 04:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
then how do you establish the the intent
 
04:37:22.869 --> 04:37:22.879 align:start position:0%
i mean you can sometimes
 
04:37:24.869 --> 04:37:24.879 align:start position:0%
use a large quantity possession with
 
04:37:27.510 --> 04:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
intent to distribute i get that
 
04:37:27.520 --> 04:37:29.990 align:start position:0%
intent to distribute i get that
but

04:37:29.990 --> 04:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:31.269 --> 04:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that just this is going
 
04:37:32.310 --> 04:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
to be something that will be drawn out
 
04:37:33.830 --> 04:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
in the course for a while
 
04:37:35.990 --> 04:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
for better for worse
 
04:37:37.590 --> 04:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative wallace
 
04:37:39.750 --> 04:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just
 
04:37:41.429 --> 04:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
article 2a doesn't have any kind of
 
04:37:43.590 --> 04:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
restriction on how many firearms or how
 
04:37:44.789 --> 04:37:44.799 align:start position:0%
much ammunition an individual can
 
04:37:44.799 --> 04:37:45.910 align:start position:0%
much ammunition an individual can
possess

04:37:45.910 --> 04:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
possess
 
04:37:47.349 --> 04:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
and it's for personal consumption is it
 
04:37:47.359 --> 04:37:49.750 align:start position:0%
and it's for personal consumption is it
not

04:37:49.750 --> 04:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:49.760 --> 04:37:50.470 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:37:50.470 --> 04:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:37:52.390 --> 04:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
article 2a is the right to bear arms to
 
04:37:54.070 --> 04:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
protect yourself
 
04:37:56.629 --> 04:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
your family your property and your state
 
04:37:58.310 --> 04:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
so it's describing what you're bearing
 
04:38:00.070 --> 04:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
arms to do i'm just saying this is and
 
04:38:01.910 --> 04:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
it does not mention how many you may or
 
04:38:04.390 --> 04:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
may not possess or what type or what
 
04:38:06.949 --> 04:38:06.959 align:start position:0%
power does it
 
04:38:08.230 --> 04:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
no and there is and there is no
 
04:38:10.789 --> 04:38:10.799 align:start position:0%
restriction on on that so you can own as
 
04:38:10.799 --> 04:38:11.910 align:start position:0%
restriction on on that so you can own as
many

04:38:11.910 --> 04:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
many
 
04:38:14.150 --> 04:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
firearms as you wish and i my point is
 
04:38:16.070 --> 04:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
that this would also apply to camps in
 
04:38:17.269 --> 04:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
the same way
 
04:38:19.670 --> 04:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
for better for worse i'm not
 
04:38:21.189 --> 04:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
just as it's written that's how i would
 
04:38:22.390 --> 04:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
read it
 
04:38:23.990 --> 04:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
and it would make regulating very
 
04:38:24.000 --> 04:38:27.910 align:start position:0%
and it would make regulating very
difficult

04:38:27.910 --> 04:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:30.470 --> 04:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
which which that may be accurate
 
04:38:32.470 --> 04:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative harry gathered thank you
 
04:38:34.789 --> 04:38:34.799 align:start position:0%
mr chair um
 
04:38:36.470 --> 04:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
when i look at this and it says adults
 
04:38:37.670 --> 04:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming
 
04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
that is 18 years and older
 
04:38:42.150 --> 04:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say to the committee let's
 
04:38:44.470 --> 04:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
not forget what effect
 
04:38:46.390 --> 04:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis has had on the younger
 
04:38:47.910 --> 04:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
generation particularly those between
 
04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 and say 25 and how many of
 
04:38:53.349 --> 04:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
them have ended in the mental ward
 
04:38:55.830 --> 04:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
because of cannabis
 
04:38:57.670 --> 04:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
so i really think when we're talking
 
04:38:59.269 --> 04:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
about this that we really need to be
 
04:39:00.949 --> 04:39:00.959 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
04:39:03.429 --> 04:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
about the age limits that would want to
 
04:39:05.670 --> 04:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
do cannabis with or say that it's legal
 
04:39:07.830 --> 04:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:39:12.869 --> 04:39:12.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:14.949 --> 04:39:14.959 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
04:39:16.390 --> 04:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i'll be brief
 
04:39:17.990 --> 04:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
because i don't want to bogot anyone's
 
04:39:19.590 --> 04:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
important time
 
04:39:21.910 --> 04:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
04:39:23.670 --> 04:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
see uh one we just
 
04:39:27.910 --> 04:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
voted on ca cr34 that itld so the people
 
04:39:30.310 --> 04:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
aren't going to have a vote on that
 
04:39:32.709 --> 04:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
this one is a simple possession
 
04:39:32.719 --> 04:39:34.390 align:start position:0%
this one is a simple possession
um

04:39:34.390 --> 04:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
i don't understand the the worries about
 
04:39:40.150 --> 04:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
maybe you have two ounces or two pounds
 
04:39:41.830 --> 04:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh there's no limitation on how much
 
04:39:44.230 --> 04:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
alcohol i can have in my house
 
04:39:44.240 --> 04:39:46.390 align:start position:0%
alcohol i can have in my house
um

04:39:46.390 --> 04:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:48.948 --> 04:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
again this is just the
 
04:39:52.310 --> 04:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
let the people say what they want that
 
04:39:54.788 --> 04:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
if the if the
 
04:39:54.798 --> 04:39:58.628 align:start position:0%
if the if the
anecdotal

04:39:58.628 --> 04:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:00.230 --> 04:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
tales that we have that the vast
 
04:40:01.830 --> 04:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
majority of the people are in favor of
 
04:40:04.390 --> 04:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
legalization let's give them the vote
 
04:40:05.990 --> 04:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
maybe they're not happy with the fact
 
04:40:10.708 --> 04:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
that we're still dragging this issue out
 
04:40:13.350 --> 04:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
that's why i cannot support the
 
04:40:16.868 --> 04:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
do not support the itl thank you
 
04:40:20.230 --> 04:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
if i can inquire in about
 
04:40:21.750 --> 04:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
the cacr
 
04:40:24.310 --> 04:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
with in respect to hp 1598 we we just
 
04:40:25.750 --> 04:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
passed in the house
 
04:40:28.788 --> 04:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
by vote 235 to 119
 
04:40:31.350 --> 04:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended
 
04:40:33.670 --> 04:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
this cacr
 
04:40:35.270 --> 04:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
arguably would conflict with even that
 
04:40:35.280 --> 04:40:37.030 align:start position:0%
arguably would conflict with even that
legislation

04:40:37.030 --> 04:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:40:40.150 --> 04:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:40.160 --> 04:40:41.910 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:40:41.910 --> 04:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:40:43.990 --> 04:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it would i just don't
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:50.070 --> 04:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
representative true you may resp
 
04:40:51.430 --> 04:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
you have an excited look and you're i'm
 
04:40:53.510 --> 04:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
curious um
 
04:40:56.948 --> 04:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
no if if we legalize cannabis
 
04:40:59.350 --> 04:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
we can't have any laws that conflict
 
04:41:01.830 --> 04:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
it's just it's legalized and it wouldn't
 
04:41:03.910 --> 04:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
be we doing it it would be the people
 
04:41:06.628 --> 04:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:06.638 --> 04:41:09.190 align:start position:0%
 
correct

04:41:09.190 --> 04:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:13.190 --> 04:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
we're representing the people now
 
04:41:14.788 --> 04:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
04:41:15.670 --> 04:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:41:17.910 --> 04:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you i just want to make one more
 
04:41:19.270 --> 04:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
point with
 
04:41:22.948 --> 04:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
the the blanket legalization argument
 
04:41:24.628 --> 04:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
is that if
 
04:41:27.110 --> 04:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
anyone of a certain age remembers the
 
04:41:29.350 --> 04:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
difference between cannabis today and
 
04:41:32.708 --> 04:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
cannabis say in the 1980s or 70s
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
what is going to happen with the genetic
 
04:41:36.470 --> 04:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
engineering of these plants in the
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
future going forward we have no idea
 
04:41:41.030 --> 04:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis could be infused with with
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
opium or bread with something else and
 
04:41:45.350 --> 04:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
it would still fall into this i i feel
 
04:41:49.270 --> 04:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
like again making a blanket it's okay
 
04:41:51.270 --> 04:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
it's opening pandora's box we don't know
 
04:41:53.190 --> 04:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen and furthermore
 
04:41:55.830 --> 04:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
this is still federally illegal
 
04:41:57.910 --> 04:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
and if we you want to bring attention
 
04:41:59.830 --> 04:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
you know the feds have so far been
 
04:42:01.910 --> 04:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
staying at arm's length when states do
 
04:42:03.030 --> 04:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
these things
 
04:42:04.788 --> 04:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
well the first state that's going to go
 
04:42:06.310 --> 04:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
ahead and say well we have no regulation
 
04:42:08.310 --> 04:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
whatsoever come to new hampshire and you
 
04:42:10.070 --> 04:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
can have all the part you want is going
 
04:42:11.990 --> 04:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
to draw federal attention
 
04:42:14.628 --> 04:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
um and every single person who has this
 
04:42:16.230 --> 04:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
04:42:19.030 --> 04:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
prohibited from owning a firearm
 
04:42:21.510 --> 04:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
there's all kind of implications so it'd
 
04:42:23.430 --> 04:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
be great we put in our constitution we
 
04:42:26.310 --> 04:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
can have part no problems well
 
04:42:28.150 --> 04:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
every single person who uses it is in
 
04:42:30.230 --> 04:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
violation of federal law regardless of
 
04:42:32.708 --> 04:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
what our constitution says so
 
04:42:40.070 --> 04:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:42.868 --> 04:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
04:42:45.430 --> 04:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that i have spoken
 
04:42:48.788 --> 04:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
in favor of cannabis legalization
 
04:42:51.670 --> 04:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
on the house floor multiple times
 
04:42:53.910 --> 04:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
and i will do so again as long as it
 
04:42:53.920 --> 04:42:54.948 align:start position:0%
and i will do so again as long as it
takes

04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
takes
 
04:42:57.350 --> 04:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
but i do not think that a constitutional
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
amendment is the right venue to take
 
04:43:01.910 --> 04:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
to make this happen
 
04:43:04.948 --> 04:43:04.958 align:start position:0%
when i look at our bill of rights i see
 
04:43:07.190 --> 04:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
natural rights equality of men the right
 
04:43:08.550 --> 04:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
of privacy
 
04:43:10.390 --> 04:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
rights of conscience
 
04:43:14.470 --> 04:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
i just don't think that cannabis
 
04:43:17.590 --> 04:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
is at that same level
 
04:43:20.150 --> 04:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
and uh i think the best way to approach
 
04:43:22.390 --> 04:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
this is through the legislation uh that
 
04:43:25.270 --> 04:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
we have let's pass it let's convince the
 
04:43:27.190 --> 04:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
senate to go agree with it and get the
 
04:43:29.750 --> 04:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
governor to sign it and cannabis
 
04:43:31.830 --> 04:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
legalization will happen in new
 
04:43:31.840 --> 04:43:33.510 align:start position:0%
legalization will happen in new
hampshire

04:43:33.510 --> 04:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:43:37.270 --> 04:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:39.350 --> 04:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative testerman
 
04:43:41.190 --> 04:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
i think i heard something a few minutes
 
04:43:41.200 --> 04:43:43.990 align:start position:0%
i think i heard something a few minutes
ago

04:43:43.990 --> 04:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:46.628 --> 04:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
representative roy did you say that
 
04:43:49.670 --> 04:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
if we legalize cannabis in this state
 
04:43:51.670 --> 04:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
that those people who are using it

cannot own an owner a firearm

use it
 
04:44:04.150 --> 04:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
no it says a user
 
04:44:05.510 --> 04:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
the courts have interpreted that as a
 
04:44:07.270 --> 04:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
regular user i think it says ninth
 
04:44:08.628 --> 04:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
circuit though that's not our circuit
 
04:44:10.310 --> 04:44:10.320 align:start position:0%

04:47:33.830 --> 04:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
i'm personally acquainted with two
 
04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
incidents of a school board chair and a
 
04:47:37.670 --> 04:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
superintendent who overstepped their
 
04:47:40.550 --> 04:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
authority by denying the two people one
 
04:47:42.550 --> 04:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
a document and the other access to
 
04:47:45.110 --> 04:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
school buildings we need for there to be
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
consequences for these abuses or they
 
04:47:48.868 --> 04:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
will just continue
 
04:47:51.030 --> 04:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
it was expensive and a lengthy process
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
for the person denied the document to go
 
04:47:54.868 --> 04:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
to court to prevail
 
04:47:56.628 --> 04:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
a threat of misdemeanor might have
 
04:47:59.510 --> 04:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
produced the document sooner
 
04:48:01.350 --> 04:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
in the case of being denied access to
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
school property the superintendent made
 
04:48:05.510 --> 04:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
up a charge of endangerment when the
 
04:48:08.150 --> 04:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
member contradicted his presumption that
 
04:48:10.230 --> 04:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
going outside to a portable classroom
 
04:48:13.430 --> 04:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
puts students in danger the members said
 
04:48:15.510 --> 04:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
i was trained as a sniper if i wanted to
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
harm children it would be while they
 
04:48:18.310 --> 04:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
were on the playground
 
04:48:20.550 --> 04:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent overreacted was and
 
04:48:22.070 --> 04:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
accused the member of dangerous and
 
04:48:24.150 --> 04:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
inflammatory statements and issued a ban
 
04:48:26.230 --> 04:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
on him being on school property so
 
04:48:27.430 --> 04:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
happens that the school property is
 
04:48:28.788 --> 04:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
where we go to vote
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
was he denying him of his vote
 
04:48:32.788 --> 04:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
i've heard of other instances of
 
04:48:34.150 --> 04:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
high-handedness of people whose
 
04:48:35.510 --> 04:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
positions went to their head and they
 
04:48:37.270 --> 04:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
took upon themselves powers that they
 
04:48:38.788 --> 04:48:38.798 align:start position:0%
did not possess
 
04:48:41.270 --> 04:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
in most cases the abuser had a conflict
 
04:48:43.430 --> 04:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
with the opinions of the abused party
 
04:48:46.070 --> 04:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
and was seeking some sort of revenge
 
04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is to keep
 
04:48:49.510 --> 04:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
discussions civil
 
04:48:51.350 --> 04:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
so that no one tries some action that is
 
04:48:51.360 --> 04:48:52.868 align:start position:0%
so that no one tries some action that is
inappropriate

04:48:52.868 --> 04:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
04:48:54.390 --> 04:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
this threat of misdemeanor will be
 
04:48:56.470 --> 04:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
seldom used but should serve as a
 
04:48:59.110 --> 04:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
reminder that disagreements on policy
 
04:49:01.110 --> 04:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
should be resolved by a motion and a
 
04:49:03.990 --> 04:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
vote not vindictiveness please support
 
04:49:06.070 --> 04:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
this proposal happy to answer any
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:14.310 --> 04:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:15.910 --> 04:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:49:18.628 --> 04:49:18.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:49:20.708 --> 04:49:20.718 align:start position:0%
so my understanding
 
04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
is that an elected school for school
 
04:49:25.030 --> 04:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
board official
 
04:49:27.910 --> 04:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
is elected for policies and financials
 
04:49:30.948 --> 04:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
of the district so how would you propose
 
04:49:33.750 --> 04:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
if a school board member chooses that
 
04:49:36.230 --> 04:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
they want to see documents such as the
 
04:49:38.550 --> 04:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
benefits that a school employee has
 
04:49:38.560 --> 04:49:39.590 align:start position:0%
benefits that a school employee has
chosen

04:49:39.590 --> 04:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
chosen
 
04:49:42.788 --> 04:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
or an iep of a student
 
04:49:44.948 --> 04:49:44.958 align:start position:0%
or any other the confidential
 
04:49:47.430 --> 04:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
information because it says here
 
04:49:50.948 --> 04:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
shall not be denied access to any school
 
04:49:53.990 --> 04:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
facilities documents so how would you
 
04:49:54.000 --> 04:49:55.510 align:start position:0%
facilities documents so how would you
propose

04:49:55.510 --> 04:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
propose
 
04:49:57.750 --> 04:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
excluding the documents
 
04:49:59.670 --> 04:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
if it was relevant to decisions they
 
04:50:00.948 --> 04:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
were going to make
 
04:50:03.990 --> 04:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
about finances and and staffing and so
 
04:50:06.150 --> 04:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
on you know they may not be able to have
 
04:50:08.070 --> 04:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
it in a form that they could pass out to
 
04:50:09.750 --> 04:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
someone else but they should be able to
 
04:50:13.670 --> 04:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:16.628 --> 04:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:50:19.270 --> 04:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
are you aware that in that a student's
 
04:50:22.150 --> 04:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
iep is absolutely absolutely
 
04:50:24.070 --> 04:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
confidential information and no school
 
04:50:26.070 --> 04:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
board member at any time has access to
 
04:50:27.430 --> 04:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
see that
 
04:50:30.550 --> 04:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
they may be looking at the costs and and
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
have things redacted that then that are
 
04:50:34.708 --> 04:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
confidential but there should be an
 
04:50:37.110 --> 04:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
overall idea of what are we spending on
 
04:50:39.270 --> 04:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
special ed how many students are
 
04:50:40.948 --> 04:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
involved and
 
04:50:43.510 --> 04:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
what's the most expensive and so on and
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
quite often we hear about two hundred
 
04:50:47.670 --> 04:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars being spent on special
 
04:50:48.868 --> 04:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
ed well everybody's going to figure out
 
04:50:50.470 --> 04:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
who it is
 
04:50:52.150 --> 04:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
and wonder if there's some other
 
04:50:54.070 --> 04:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
alternative and have they have people
 
04:50:55.990 --> 04:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
looked into the alternative so there's
 
04:50:57.350 --> 04:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
there's things that they may need to
 
04:51:00.150 --> 04:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
know that could be redacted as far as
 
04:51:02.550 --> 04:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
identifying a specific student and i
 
04:51:04.628 --> 04:51:04.638 align:start position:0%
know when when we talk about the hipaa
 
04:51:04.638 --> 04:51:05.670 align:start position:0%
know when when we talk about the hipaa
and

04:51:05.670 --> 04:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:51:07.750 --> 04:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
i've gone to uh when we're doing
 
04:51:10.150 --> 04:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
education and finance and we say you
 
04:51:11.750 --> 04:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
know we need to know
 
04:51:13.350 --> 04:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
how many uh students of this and that
 
04:51:15.590 --> 04:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
and their their claim is well we can't
 
04:51:17.670 --> 04:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
give it to you because you would figure
 
04:51:19.430 --> 04:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
out which student it is and that would
 
04:51:20.868 --> 04:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
that would uh
 
04:51:23.990 --> 04:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
betray confidential information so
 
04:51:25.750 --> 04:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know there are some parts of it that
 
04:51:27.590 --> 04:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
can be revealed
 
04:51:27.600 --> 04:51:28.628 align:start position:0%
can be revealed
without

04:51:28.628 --> 04:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:51:30.390 --> 04:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
and and i'm sure that they could use
 
04:51:33.030 --> 04:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
that that argument but once it's
 
04:51:34.788 --> 04:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
redacted and
 
04:51:36.628 --> 04:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
the gist of the information could be
 
04:51:42.788 --> 04:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:46.628 --> 04:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:48.948 --> 04:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh thank you for answering
 
04:51:51.670 --> 04:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
my question are you aware of the
 
04:51:51.680 --> 04:51:52.948 align:start position:0%
my question are you aware of the
question

04:51:52.948 --> 04:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:51:52.958 --> 04:51:53.990 align:start position:0%
question
uh

04:51:53.990 --> 04:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:51:55.910 --> 04:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
how do you how do we audit you who
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
audits you
 
04:52:01.190 --> 04:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know are these properly identified
 
04:52:03.750 --> 04:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
and the answer was well we can't be
 
04:52:03.760 --> 04:52:04.868 align:start position:0%
and the answer was well we can't be
audited

04:52:04.868 --> 04:52:04.878 align:start position:0%
audited
 
04:52:04.878 --> 04:52:06.310 align:start position:0%
audited
so

04:52:06.310 --> 04:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:52:08.948 --> 04:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't i need access to some of these
 
04:52:12.230 --> 04:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
kinds of documents to determine if if
 
04:52:14.550 --> 04:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
we're our
 
04:52:16.390 --> 04:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
special ed people are doing their job
 
04:52:16.400 --> 04:52:19.510 align:start position:0%
special ed people are doing their job
correctly

04:52:19.510 --> 04:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:21.030 --> 04:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
i would hope that would be the case
 
04:52:22.948 --> 04:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of this under
 
04:52:25.590 --> 04:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
hipaa and and confidentiality that a lot
 
04:52:27.910 --> 04:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
of information is withheld not only from
 
04:52:29.990 --> 04:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
the public but for the people on the on
 
04:52:32.390 --> 04:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
the policy making things so i think that
 
04:52:33.510 --> 04:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
some of these things need to be
 
04:52:35.350 --> 04:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
re-examined just
 
04:52:37.750 --> 04:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
an hour or so ago we were meeting on
 
04:52:39.590 --> 04:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
legislative performance audit and
 
04:52:41.990 --> 04:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and we were calling
 
04:52:42.000 --> 04:52:42.788 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and we were calling
for

04:52:42.788 --> 04:52:42.798 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:52:46.230 --> 04:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
an uh an audit of this special ed
 
04:52:48.310 --> 04:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
and we went over several of the things
 
04:52:49.750 --> 04:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
and many of us had been involved in
 
04:52:51.910 --> 04:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
other committees previously on special
 
04:52:53.110 --> 04:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
ed spending
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
and we're going to wait for another
 
04:52:57.430 --> 04:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
scoping statement to come back from from
 
04:52:59.750 --> 04:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
the the audit division on looking at
 
04:53:01.030 --> 04:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
these sort of things and it'll be
 
04:53:03.430 --> 04:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
interesting how much of this
 
04:53:06.628 --> 04:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
stonewalling we get but we're looking at
 
04:53:08.628 --> 04:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
it from a
 
04:53:10.310 --> 04:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
kind of a high level
 
04:53:11.990 --> 04:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
place and and
 
04:53:14.150 --> 04:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
what i do know and they had not done a
 
04:53:15.350 --> 04:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
04:53:18.230 --> 04:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
audit since 1999
 
04:53:20.070 --> 04:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
which is highly unusual that it goes
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
that long so
 
04:53:24.390 --> 04:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
in the interim you and i have seen
 
04:53:26.550 --> 04:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
huge increases in staffing
 
04:53:28.310 --> 04:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
which they're building their own empire
 
04:53:29.430 --> 04:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
under this
 
04:53:31.830 --> 04:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
guise of we can't we can't expose this
 
04:53:31.840 --> 04:53:32.948 align:start position:0%
guise of we can't we can't expose this
so

04:53:32.948 --> 04:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:53:34.948 --> 04:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
we may have later legislation to say you
 
04:53:36.948 --> 04:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
know within a certain realm of
 
04:53:39.190 --> 04:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
policymakers yes this can be exposed but
 
04:53:41.350 --> 04:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
they would have to take an oath not to
 
04:53:46.550 --> 04:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:48.788 --> 04:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
representative espidia
 
04:53:50.310 --> 04:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
i just want to thank you mr church you
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
want to follow up with your with your
 
04:53:54.470 --> 04:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
statement that you just made so
 
04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
you believe that they're building an
 
04:53:58.390 --> 04:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
empire under the sun for
 
04:53:59.830 --> 04:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
oh sorry for
 
04:54:03.030 --> 04:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
for special education
 
04:54:04.550 --> 04:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
some of the most vulnerable students
 
04:54:06.628 --> 04:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
04:54:06.638 --> 04:54:07.750 align:start position:0%
that we have
okay

04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:54:10.310 --> 04:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
yes and we also discussed within that
 
04:54:11.590 --> 04:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
other committee
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
what have been the results
 
04:54:15.590 --> 04:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
from the millions of dollars that all
 
04:54:15.600 --> 04:54:16.788 align:start position:0%
from the millions of dollars that all
our

04:54:16.788 --> 04:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:54:19.270 --> 04:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are paying and yet we have
 
04:54:21.110 --> 04:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
people that get handed a diploma who
 
04:54:23.830 --> 04:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:26.628 --> 04:54:26.638 align:start position:0%
so why wasn't that taken care of so
 
04:54:28.390 --> 04:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
there's lots of failures in this this
 
04:54:31.590 --> 04:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
whole system that i think that everybody
 
04:54:32.948 --> 04:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
needs to get a look at and we're going
 
04:54:34.230 --> 04:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
to have an audit and it's going to give
 
04:54:35.270 --> 04:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
us some
 
04:54:37.190 --> 04:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
some further
 
04:54:40.470 --> 04:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
leading and where to go thank you
 
04:54:41.830 --> 04:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for your
 
04:54:43.830 --> 04:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
testimony and the chair will inquire
 
04:54:45.510 --> 04:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
with a question and thank you for taking
 
04:54:46.868 --> 04:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:54:49.110 --> 04:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
when an iep's put together for a student
 
04:54:51.430 --> 04:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
it's would you done in some team meeting
 
04:54:53.110 --> 04:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
setting where there's
 
04:54:54.550 --> 04:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
several i don't want to say i don't
 
04:54:56.390 --> 04:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders right term but there'll be
 
04:54:57.830 --> 04:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
several people at the table putting it
 
04:54:57.840 --> 04:54:59.190 align:start position:0%
several people at the table putting it
together

04:54:59.190 --> 04:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:55:00.948 --> 04:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
where the education plan is targeted for
 
04:55:02.868 --> 04:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
that individual student
 
04:55:05.510 --> 04:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
so i suppose if you did audit it
 
04:55:05.520 --> 04:55:07.030 align:start position:0%
so i suppose if you did audit it
i

04:55:07.030 --> 04:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:55:09.270 --> 04:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is how wouldn't the
 
04:55:12.150 --> 04:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
numbers con constantly change based on
 
04:55:14.230 --> 04:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
how the iep evolves as the child
 
04:55:15.590 --> 04:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
progresses through school or once the
 
04:55:17.750 --> 04:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
child graduates those numbers would be
 
04:55:17.760 --> 04:55:18.868 align:start position:0%
child graduates those numbers would be
stale

04:55:18.868 --> 04:55:18.878 align:start position:0%
stale
 
04:55:21.030 --> 04:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
granted it's a snapshot of given time
 
04:55:22.150 --> 04:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
and place
 
04:55:22.160 --> 04:55:23.110 align:start position:0%
and place
but

04:55:23.110 --> 04:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:55:23.120 --> 04:55:24.628 align:start position:0%
but
nevertheless

04:55:24.628 --> 04:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
nevertheless
 
04:55:27.030 --> 04:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
what did you spend this last
 
04:55:27.040 --> 04:55:28.628 align:start position:0%
what did you spend this last
year

04:55:28.628 --> 04:55:28.638 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:55:28.638 --> 04:55:29.350 align:start position:0%
year
on

04:55:29.350 --> 04:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:55:31.510 --> 04:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
how many different students and we just
 
04:55:33.590 --> 04:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
looked at i think there was a list of 15
 
04:55:35.430 --> 04:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
different categories that they could be
 
04:55:36.628 --> 04:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
put in
 
04:55:36.638 --> 04:55:37.350 align:start position:0%
put in
and

04:55:37.350 --> 04:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:55:39.350 --> 04:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know multiple things obviously
 
04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
blindness and deafness are fairly
 
04:55:44.390 --> 04:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
apparent but then there's also you know
 
04:55:46.708 --> 04:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
a bunch of other things nervousness and
 
04:55:50.310 --> 04:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
anxiety and all these things that um
 
04:55:51.750 --> 04:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know it
 
04:55:54.070 --> 04:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
in some cases when i visited charter
 
04:55:56.310 --> 04:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
schools they had students they had they
 
04:55:57.510 --> 04:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
pointed out to me they had three
 
04:55:59.510 --> 04:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
students that came there with
 
04:56:01.990 --> 04:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
special ed for anxiety
 
04:56:03.990 --> 04:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
once they were in the charter school
 
04:56:06.070 --> 04:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
the anxiety went away
 
04:56:06.080 --> 04:56:06.868 align:start position:0%
the anxiety went away
so

04:56:06.868 --> 04:56:06.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:56:09.190 --> 04:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes these things need to
 
04:56:13.430 --> 04:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
be reassessed on a regular basis so
 
04:56:18.230 --> 04:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:21.270 --> 04:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question um
 
04:56:22.110 --> 04:56:22.120 align:start position:0%
i was wondering
 
04:56:22.120 --> 04:56:25.190 align:start position:0%
i was wondering

[Music]
 
04:56:26.708 --> 04:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
the way that it looks like the way that
 
04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is structured
 
04:56:31.030 --> 04:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
you want to guarantee access
 
04:56:33.830 --> 04:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
to facility records and staff
 
04:56:35.750 --> 04:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
with the exception of people who are
 
04:56:37.510 --> 04:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
either being investigated for have been
 
04:56:40.160 --> 04:56:40.170 align:start position:0%
convicted of certain crimes
 
04:56:40.170 --> 04:56:42.230 align:start position:0%
convicted of certain crimes
[Music]

04:56:42.230 --> 04:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the fact that there are
 
04:56:45.590 --> 04:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
definitely lawmakers in new hampshire
 
04:56:47.110 --> 04:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
who've been convicted of crimes but are
 
04:56:49.590 --> 04:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
not necessarily a threat at the time
 
04:56:51.370 --> 04:56:51.380 align:start position:0%
that they're elected
 
04:56:51.380 --> 04:56:53.670 align:start position:0%
that they're elected
[Music]

04:56:53.670 --> 04:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:56:56.788 --> 04:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
is there a reason that you excluded
 
04:56:59.110 --> 04:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
um because i i looked at the list uh
 
04:57:02.070 --> 04:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
under rsa 189 colon 13-a i looked at the
 
04:57:04.788 --> 04:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
list of
 
04:57:06.868 --> 04:57:06.878 align:start position:0%
violation violations
 
04:57:09.270 --> 04:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the rsas and there's a
 
04:57:13.750 --> 04:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
reason that you decided to exclude 644
 
04:57:17.030 --> 04:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:19.830 --> 04:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
rsa and i and i would imagine that like
 
04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
someone who's
 
04:57:23.350 --> 04:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
maybe become
 
04:57:25.990 --> 04:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
troublesome for school staff who needs
 
04:57:27.910 --> 04:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
to be removed from the property
 
04:57:30.628 --> 04:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
harassment would be a basis for i like i
 
04:57:31.830 --> 04:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
think i feel like that's plausible
 
04:57:32.948 --> 04:57:32.958 align:start position:0%
especially with the things going on in
 
04:57:32.958 --> 04:57:34.230 align:start position:0%
especially with the things going on in

04:57:34.230 --> 04:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
04:57:34.240 --> 04:57:35.190 align:start position:0%
nashua
um

04:57:35.190 --> 04:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:37.430 --> 04:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering
 
04:57:40.230 --> 04:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
if there was an intent to exclude that
 
04:57:41.590 --> 04:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question as
 
04:57:46.150 --> 04:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:49.190 --> 04:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
if someone has been charged for a crime
 
04:57:50.550 --> 04:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
and they
 
04:57:52.230 --> 04:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
and they have been elected to the school
 
04:57:52.240 --> 04:57:53.910 align:start position:0%
and they have been elected to the school
board

04:57:53.910 --> 04:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:57:53.920 --> 04:57:55.910 align:start position:0%
board
and

04:57:55.910 --> 04:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:57:57.430 --> 04:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
they would want to grab everything they
 
04:57:59.270 --> 04:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't sometimes be problematic just
 
04:58:01.750 --> 04:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
don't make make trouble for everybody
 
04:58:01.760 --> 04:58:02.470 align:start position:0%
don't make make trouble for everybody
and

04:58:02.470 --> 04:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:58:04.070 --> 04:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
so the idea is you're under
 
04:58:06.868 --> 04:58:06.878 align:start position:0%
investigation all of a sudden we get a
 
04:58:10.230 --> 04:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
the court and the attorneys are closing
 
04:58:11.510 --> 04:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
the amount of
 
04:58:13.190 --> 04:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
stuff you can get and obviously you'd
 
04:58:15.590 --> 04:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
probably at some point be removed from
 
04:58:19.590 --> 04:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
the board while this is pending so
 
04:58:22.070 --> 04:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
that person could couldn't come back and
 
04:58:28.470 --> 04:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:30.310 --> 04:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
just to kind of tie up things in court
 
04:58:33.190 --> 04:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
by presenting this and this and this
 
04:58:34.390 --> 04:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
representative bouldin you recognize for
 
04:58:37.270 --> 04:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:39.270 --> 04:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
sorry i just want to take one stab at
 
04:58:42.070 --> 04:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
clarifying my discombobulated question
 
04:58:44.948 --> 04:58:44.958 align:start position:0%
it appears that this legislation
 
04:58:46.708 --> 04:58:46.718 align:start position:0%
would guarantee access to a school
 
04:58:49.030 --> 04:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
facility by a person who's maybe been
 
04:58:50.390 --> 04:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
engaging in harassment against the
 
04:58:53.270 --> 04:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
school or students in the school
 
04:58:55.110 --> 04:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
staff at the school something along
 
04:58:56.708 --> 04:58:56.718 align:start position:0%
those lines and i could see that it's
 
04:58:58.550 --> 04:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
being plausible given the current
 
04:59:00.310 --> 04:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
environment in politics and so i was
 
04:59:02.150 --> 04:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
wondering if that was
 
04:59:05.110 --> 04:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
um if you're aware of that and if it was
 
04:59:07.030 --> 04:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
um intentional if you feel like that's
 
04:59:09.510 --> 04:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
less of a risk um
 
04:59:11.430 --> 04:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
thanks for letting me take another stab
 
04:59:13.510 --> 04:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
at it well it's very specific you have
 
04:59:15.590 --> 04:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
to be elected to the school board to
 
04:59:17.590 --> 04:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
request these documents
 
04:59:19.670 --> 04:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
and then the people that elected you are
 
04:59:21.190 --> 04:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
going to expect you to serve them and
 
04:59:23.030 --> 04:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
not your own purposes
 
04:59:24.708 --> 04:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
to get
 
04:59:26.230 --> 04:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
policy making and
 
04:59:27.430 --> 04:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
budgets done
 
04:59:27.440 --> 04:59:28.310 align:start position:0%
budgets done
so

04:59:28.310 --> 04:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:59:30.390 --> 04:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's kind of narrow it and
 
04:59:31.750 --> 04:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know they would
 
04:59:33.030 --> 04:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
if it was somebody that's going to
 
04:59:33.040 --> 04:59:34.070 align:start position:0%
if it was somebody that's going to
harass

04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
harass
 
04:59:35.430 --> 04:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
usually they would have been harassing
 
04:59:36.868 --> 04:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
before they became a candidate and
 
04:59:38.150 --> 04:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
everyone would be aware of it and
 
04:59:40.390 --> 04:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they wouldn't be elected
 
04:59:45.670 --> 04:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:47.350 --> 04:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:59:49.510 --> 04:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
04:59:51.670 --> 04:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
i'm envisioning this
 
04:59:53.350 --> 04:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
like if i went
 
04:59:55.510 --> 04:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
and requested a police report they're
 
04:59:57.590 --> 04:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
going to redact certain information so
 
05:00:00.150 --> 05:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming
 
05:00:01.990 --> 05:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
that the school board member is not
 
05:00:04.390 --> 05:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
going to want to know that little tommy
 
05:00:06.628 --> 05:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
lives at seven bay street
 
05:00:09.670 --> 05:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
and sally lives at uh mammoth road you
 
05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
know some number uh it's it's it's just
 
05:00:14.230 --> 05:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
the overall
 
05:00:15.910 --> 05:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
how much is it costing
 
05:00:17.590 --> 05:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
this is the students
 
05:00:19.430 --> 05:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
these are the staff right you know it's
 
05:00:21.270 --> 05:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
kind of an overview it's it's not
 
05:00:23.190 --> 05:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
personal information that the member
 
05:00:24.470 --> 05:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
would be after
 
05:00:32.070 --> 05:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:34.708 --> 05:00:34.718 align:start position:0%
representative newman thank you and
 
05:00:37.190 --> 05:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:00:40.070 --> 05:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
um as i look at the words access to any
 
05:00:42.150 --> 05:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
school facilities are there any
 
05:00:42.160 --> 05:00:43.750 align:start position:0%
school facilities are there any
limitations

05:00:43.750 --> 05:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
05:00:45.830 --> 05:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
or is any
 
05:00:48.150 --> 05:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
elected official have access to the
 
05:00:50.708 --> 05:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
school to go anytime anywhere in the
 
05:00:50.718 --> 05:00:51.670 align:start position:0%
school to go anytime anywhere in the
school

05:00:51.670 --> 05:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:00:54.550 --> 05:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
are there any limitations
 
05:00:56.708 --> 05:00:56.718 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's the intent but
 
05:00:59.110 --> 05:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
the the thing i'm responding to was this
 
05:01:01.430 --> 05:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
as as i say in in
 
05:01:04.788 --> 05:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
number three um saying you know this is
 
05:01:07.030 --> 05:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
a foolish thing saying kids can't walk
 
05:01:08.868 --> 05:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
outside to go to the classroom because
 
05:01:10.390 --> 05:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
if somebody wanted to
 
05:01:12.310 --> 05:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
hurt them they'd be a sniper oh that's
 
05:01:13.990 --> 05:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
such a terrible statement you can't go
 
05:01:17.190 --> 05:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
anywhere near school property i mean
 
05:01:18.550 --> 05:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think i think that was
 
05:01:19.990 --> 05:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
overstepping the authority of that
 
05:01:20.000 --> 05:01:23.350 align:start position:0%
overstepping the authority of that
superintendent

05:01:23.350 --> 05:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:23.360 --> 05:01:24.788 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:01:24.788 --> 05:01:24.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:01:26.390 --> 05:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative newman recognized for a
 
05:01:26.400 --> 05:01:30.070 align:start position:0%
representative newman recognized for a
follow-up

05:01:30.070 --> 05:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:32.948 --> 05:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
thank you and i i
 
05:01:35.750 --> 05:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
i don't support doing uh you know
 
05:01:38.150 --> 05:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
supporting or turning down legislation
 
05:01:40.788 --> 05:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
on anecdotal information so i
 
05:01:43.270 --> 05:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
i just think that there's too many
 
05:01:44.788 --> 05:01:44.798 align:start position:0%
things that
 
05:01:47.430 --> 05:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll put a question um
 
05:01:48.708 --> 05:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
do you think the
 
05:01:50.788 --> 05:01:50.798 align:start position:0%
principal of the school
 
05:01:53.270 --> 05:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
will be able to control the safety of
 
05:01:56.070 --> 05:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
his school if he if
 
05:01:58.868 --> 05:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
any elected official has access to the
 
05:02:01.350 --> 05:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
school for any reason at any time to do
 
05:02:01.360 --> 05:02:02.868 align:start position:0%
school for any reason at any time to do
anything

05:02:02.868 --> 05:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
anything
 
05:02:04.788 --> 05:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
no i think that's understood when they
 
05:02:06.310 --> 05:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
when they go on the school board that
 
05:02:08.788 --> 05:02:08.798 align:start position:0%
it's there's a certain limit to where
 
05:02:10.708 --> 05:02:10.718 align:start position:0%
how they will behave and
 
05:02:12.948 --> 05:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
you know unless they're invited into the
 
05:02:15.190 --> 05:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
school and asked to sit in a class or
 
05:02:17.670 --> 05:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
make a presentation they're not expected
 
05:02:20.310 --> 05:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
to be there but to say you know it's
 
05:02:23.110 --> 05:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
we forbid you to go to any school
 
05:02:23.120 --> 05:02:24.628 align:start position:0%
we forbid you to go to any school
ground

05:02:24.628 --> 05:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
ground
 
05:02:25.830 --> 05:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know maybe it needs a little
 
05:02:32.628 --> 05:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:37.590 --> 05:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:39.430 --> 05:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you for taking
 
05:02:42.070 --> 05:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
this question you brought up
 
05:02:44.868 --> 05:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
special needs and ieps
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
in the work that you have done so far
 
05:02:52.310 --> 05:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
have you become aware that in
 
05:02:54.390 --> 05:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
some school districts maybe
 
05:02:55.590 --> 05:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of them
 
05:02:57.510 --> 05:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
that there are parents who don't feel
 
05:03:00.470 --> 05:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
their children's ieps are being met
 
05:03:02.948 --> 05:03:02.958 align:start position:0%
because the school districts are
 
05:03:05.670 --> 05:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
there's always a budget situation there
 
05:03:07.270 --> 05:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
so have you
 
05:03:09.910 --> 05:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
talked about that at all thank you yeah
 
05:03:11.830 --> 05:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's one of the things we we
 
05:03:13.750 --> 05:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
talked about having the audit to
 
05:03:15.830 --> 05:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
determine that sort of thing because it
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
looks like we're spending a lot of money
 
05:03:19.990 --> 05:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
for very little return so
 
05:03:21.430 --> 05:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
yes and and
 
05:03:23.670 --> 05:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
um the chairman of the performance audit
 
05:03:25.830 --> 05:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
oversight committee had just been on a a
 
05:03:25.840 --> 05:03:26.788 align:start position:0%
oversight committee had just been on a a
lengthy

05:03:26.788 --> 05:03:26.798 align:start position:0%
lengthy
 
05:03:29.030 --> 05:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
study committee that had found so many
 
05:03:30.948 --> 05:03:30.958 align:start position:0%
complaints from the parents and we're
 
05:03:32.788 --> 05:03:32.798 align:start position:0%
trying to find a way to to fix them and
 
05:03:34.230 --> 05:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
we're hoping the audit will give us some
 
05:03:36.788 --> 05:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
clues what we can include in legislation
 
05:03:37.990 --> 05:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's a
 
05:03:39.590 --> 05:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
continuing thing
 
05:03:41.510 --> 05:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you mr chairman
 
05:03:43.190 --> 05:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative weiler for
 
05:03:45.910 --> 05:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
appearing uh can you help me understand
 
05:03:48.310 --> 05:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
where in line five uh regarding
 
05:03:51.110 --> 05:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
documents it creates an expectation that
 
05:03:53.190 --> 05:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
those documents are going to be redacted
 
05:03:57.590 --> 05:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:59.270 --> 05:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
i guess it would be easy enough for the
 
05:04:01.990 --> 05:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
people to present the document to say
 
05:04:04.390 --> 05:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
here's the document you requested i am
 
05:04:07.510 --> 05:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
required to redact this by this law
 
05:04:09.110 --> 05:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
and the person would just have to accept
 
05:04:10.390 --> 05:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
that because
 
05:04:12.948 --> 05:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
the person giving you the document can
 
05:04:16.830 --> 05:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:19.510 --> 05:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
law representative the chairman inquired
 
05:04:20.948 --> 05:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
with the question
 
05:04:23.350 --> 05:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
if this if this bill were to become law
 
05:04:23.360 --> 05:04:24.550 align:start position:0%
if this if this bill were to become law
and

05:04:24.550 --> 05:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:26.868 --> 05:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
a member of the budget committee were to
 
05:04:28.788 --> 05:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
obtain documents from a school regarding
 
05:04:28.798 --> 05:04:29.990 align:start position:0%
obtain documents from a school regarding
a

05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:04:33.830 --> 05:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
a student's iep
 
05:04:35.670 --> 05:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
i understand it's it's part of an audit
 
05:04:35.680 --> 05:04:37.510 align:start position:0%
i understand it's it's part of an audit
but

05:04:37.510 --> 05:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:04:39.430 --> 05:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
what exactly would be the goal to
 
05:04:40.948 --> 05:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
accomplish what's the goal of
 
05:04:43.510 --> 05:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
accomplishment looking at the iep
 
05:04:44.868 --> 05:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
in determining whether are you trying to
 
05:04:47.430 --> 05:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
figure out what the iep was
 
05:04:48.550 --> 05:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate for that student i'm just
 
05:04:50.070 --> 05:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what would you do
 
05:04:52.550 --> 05:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
with those documents
 
05:04:54.788 --> 05:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
we've spent a hundred thousand for this
 
05:04:58.470 --> 05:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:01.670 --> 05:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
counseled by such and such a person
 
05:05:05.510 --> 05:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:08.230 --> 05:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
is there a behavioral change
 
05:05:10.550 --> 05:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
um have they learned to read have they
 
05:05:12.230 --> 05:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
learned to write
 
05:05:14.708 --> 05:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
show me show me the progress
 
05:05:16.470 --> 05:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
on this very expensive student that
 
05:05:17.670 --> 05:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
we've had for
 
05:05:19.910 --> 05:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
for a number of years i think that's a
 
05:05:23.910 --> 05:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:25.670 --> 05:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:05:28.550 --> 05:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative testament
 
05:05:29.990 --> 05:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:05:30.000 --> 05:05:30.868 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

05:05:30.868 --> 05:05:30.878 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:05:32.550 --> 05:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
are you aware that
 
05:05:35.430 --> 05:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
there is an identifier number
 
05:05:36.948 --> 05:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
assigned to each
 
05:05:39.750 --> 05:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
yes special ed student
 
05:05:39.760 --> 05:05:40.948 align:start position:0%
yes special ed student
and

05:05:40.948 --> 05:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:46.948 --> 05:05:46.958 align:start position:0%
when karen and i took them to court to
 
05:05:48.310 --> 05:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
get that data
 
05:05:51.030 --> 05:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:53.190 --> 05:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
by identifier numbers and how much they
 
05:05:54.708 --> 05:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
had spent
 
05:05:56.868 --> 05:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
we went to the supreme court it is not
 
05:05:59.830 --> 05:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
allowed even though that was a
 
05:06:01.110 --> 05:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
05:06:02.788 --> 05:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
how are you going to get around those
 
05:06:04.230 --> 05:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
the information
 
05:06:06.390 --> 05:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
say that again the supreme court is was
 
05:06:08.310 --> 05:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
not allowing you to know what that
 
05:06:10.470 --> 05:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
identifier referred to
 
05:06:12.150 --> 05:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
 
05:06:14.550 --> 05:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
said because we we wanted to look and
 
05:06:16.070 --> 05:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
see if the numbers
 
05:06:18.470 --> 05:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
in ours town were where the same numbers
 
05:06:20.470 --> 05:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
may be showing up somewhere else where
 
05:06:23.830 --> 05:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
was there double charging going on
 
05:06:23.840 --> 05:06:24.550 align:start position:0%
was there double charging going on
and

05:06:24.550 --> 05:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:06:27.990 --> 05:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
and we were we were the supreme court
 
05:06:30.070 --> 05:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
after you know a couple other courts
 
05:06:32.470 --> 05:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
said you can't have that data
 
05:06:35.350 --> 05:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:36.628 --> 05:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
i mean it is
 
05:06:38.628 --> 05:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
do you remember you remember the reason
 
05:06:40.470 --> 05:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
why you couldn't have it i have to go
 
05:06:41.750 --> 05:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
back anyway
 
05:06:41.760 --> 05:06:42.708 align:start position:0%
back anyway
okay

05:06:42.708 --> 05:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:06:44.150 --> 05:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
i guess there's other parts of the law
 
05:06:45.270 --> 05:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
that needs to be changed so we're
 
05:06:47.110 --> 05:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
looking forward to this audit that we're
 
05:06:48.550 --> 05:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
going to get back it might take a year
 
05:06:50.550 --> 05:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
to get some of the information but
 
05:06:52.390 --> 05:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of us have been stymied by
 
05:06:54.628 --> 05:06:54.638 align:start position:0%
the special ed costs and
 
05:06:56.788 --> 05:06:56.798 align:start position:0%
and the secrecy that's there that
 
05:06:59.030 --> 05:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
you don't even know why
 
05:07:01.430 --> 05:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
ex-students been under special ed for 10
 
05:07:07.510 --> 05:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:08.948 --> 05:07:08.958 align:start position:0%
just to follow up
 
05:07:11.510 --> 05:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
are you aware that eventually
 
05:07:12.948 --> 05:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
these things are all federally
 
05:07:14.948 --> 05:07:14.958 align:start position:0%
enforceable ieps become federally
 
05:07:18.788 --> 05:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
enforceable that eventually the
 
05:07:21.830 --> 05:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
special ed department will become
 
05:07:24.470 --> 05:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
head of the school
 
05:07:26.230 --> 05:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
it seems like that's the progress
 
05:07:28.550 --> 05:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
they'll come to the school board and say
 
05:07:31.350 --> 05:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
either pay up or go to jail yeah we had
 
05:07:34.708 --> 05:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
a we had some data we looked at 29 000
 
05:07:37.830 --> 05:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
plus students are special ed coded out
 
05:07:40.948 --> 05:07:40.958 align:start position:0%
of 160 000 so it's
 
05:07:42.628 --> 05:07:42.638 align:start position:0%
it's getting to be a bigger percentage i
 
05:07:43.590 --> 05:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
think we're one of the larger
 
05:07:45.990 --> 05:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
percentages in the country
 
05:07:47.350 --> 05:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
for coding
 
05:07:49.750 --> 05:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
so i definitely think this is an area we
 
05:07:52.310 --> 05:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
should all be concerned with thank you
 
05:07:59.990 --> 05:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:01.510 --> 05:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
05:08:03.750 --> 05:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um thank you for
 
05:08:06.150 --> 05:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question i you had mentioned
 
05:08:08.550 --> 05:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
hipaa several times in your testimony
 
05:08:09.910 --> 05:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
and i just want to
 
05:08:12.150 --> 05:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
um see
 
05:08:13.670 --> 05:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
if you're aware that schools actually
 
05:08:15.430 --> 05:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
don't follow under hipaa they actually
 
05:08:18.470 --> 05:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
follow under ferpa and under ferpa
 
05:08:23.030 --> 05:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:25.270 --> 05:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
we we had that question uh some years
 
05:08:27.750 --> 05:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
ago in finance when we're looking
 
05:08:27.760 --> 05:08:28.868 align:start position:0%
ago in finance when we're looking
into

05:08:28.868 --> 05:08:28.878 align:start position:0%
into
 
05:08:28.878 --> 05:08:30.628 align:start position:0%
into
um

05:08:30.628 --> 05:08:30.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:32.230 --> 05:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
some of the spending that was going on
 
05:08:34.230 --> 05:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
and that was that was the word that the
 
05:08:36.150 --> 05:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
department of ed used that's why i used
 
05:08:36.160 --> 05:08:37.030 align:start position:0%
department of ed used that's why i used
it

05:08:37.030 --> 05:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:08:39.430 --> 05:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
because we knew that 20 million was
 
05:08:42.628 --> 05:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
being spent on some students we asked to
 
05:08:42.638 --> 05:08:43.750 align:start position:0%
being spent on some students we asked to
know

05:08:43.750 --> 05:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:08:45.190 --> 05:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
can we find out
 
05:08:47.030 --> 05:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
by school district or by no you can't
 
05:08:48.948 --> 05:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
find out by student can we find out by
 
05:08:50.788 --> 05:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
school district where this this money is
 
05:08:53.030 --> 05:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
going if somebody had a medical problem
 
05:08:54.708 --> 05:08:54.718 align:start position:0%
i can't remember the
 
05:08:57.190 --> 05:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
classification but some money could come
 
05:08:59.990 --> 05:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
not only from the the school district
 
05:09:01.750 --> 05:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
but from this federal
 
05:09:01.760 --> 05:09:02.628 align:start position:0%
but from this federal
uh

05:09:02.628 --> 05:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:09:02.638 --> 05:09:04.628 align:start position:0%
uh
medicaid

05:09:04.628 --> 05:09:04.638 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
05:09:04.638 --> 05:09:05.750 align:start position:0%
medicaid
okay

05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:09:09.110 --> 05:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
now we have a formula for special ed so
 
05:09:10.550 --> 05:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
you have to spend
 
05:09:13.110 --> 05:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
three and a half times the average cost
 
05:09:14.628 --> 05:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
per pupil
 
05:09:16.708 --> 05:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
within the school district's budget
 
05:09:19.270 --> 05:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
before you that can then ask for
 
05:09:21.190 --> 05:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
what we used to call catastrophic aid to
 
05:09:22.868 --> 05:09:22.878 align:start position:0%
come from the state
 
05:09:24.628 --> 05:09:24.638 align:start position:0%
and then the state's going to pay 80
 
05:09:26.470 --> 05:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
until you get to 10 times the average
 
05:09:28.470 --> 05:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
cost per student
 
05:09:28.480 --> 05:09:29.350 align:start position:0%
cost per student
and

05:09:29.350 --> 05:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:09:31.910 --> 05:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
so what are you including
 
05:09:34.310 --> 05:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
in this three and a half times
 
05:09:35.990 --> 05:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
and you could be including
 
05:09:37.110 --> 05:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
money that
 
05:09:38.868 --> 05:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
wasn't really coming from the school
 
05:09:40.868 --> 05:09:40.878 align:start position:0%
district although that's the intent you
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
could be including money that came from
 
05:09:44.470 --> 05:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
medicaid you could be including federal
 
05:09:44.480 --> 05:09:45.910 align:start position:0%
medicaid you could be including federal
money

05:09:45.910 --> 05:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:09:47.670 --> 05:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
and you're just kind of hiding it all
 
05:09:49.510 --> 05:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
under this is how much got spent before
 
05:09:50.550 --> 05:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
we ask
 
05:09:52.708 --> 05:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
for things so that those are things that
 
05:09:54.390 --> 05:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
i get a little frustrated
 
05:09:55.750 --> 05:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
why we're having to take this money out
 
05:09:57.750 --> 05:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
of the catastrophic aid fund which isn't
 
05:10:00.868 --> 05:10:00.878 align:start position:0%
called that anymore and and uh
 
05:10:02.390 --> 05:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
because you claim you spent three and a
 
05:10:04.310 --> 05:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
half times and perhaps it wasn't all
 
05:10:05.830 --> 05:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
district money
 
05:10:07.670 --> 05:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
so those are those are the frustrations
 
05:10:09.270 --> 05:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
that arise when you're trying to find
 
05:10:12.708 --> 05:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:15.430 --> 05:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
05:10:16.550 --> 05:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:10:19.990 --> 05:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything in this bill about
 
05:10:22.070 --> 05:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
much of anything that's been discussed
 
05:10:23.190 --> 05:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
during this
 
05:10:23.200 --> 05:10:24.470 align:start position:0%
during this
session

05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
session
 
05:10:27.030 --> 05:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like there's a
 
05:10:27.040 --> 05:10:29.670 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like there's a
deep-seated

05:10:29.670 --> 05:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
deep-seated
 
05:10:29.680 --> 05:10:31.670 align:start position:0%
deep-seated
um

05:10:31.670 --> 05:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:34.470 --> 05:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
just i wouldn't say opposition but
 
05:10:37.350 --> 05:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
i guess is the goal of this to uh
 
05:10:39.590 --> 05:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
restrict access
 
05:10:41.910 --> 05:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
to services for students in special ed
 
05:10:43.510 --> 05:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
is that what you're really after here
 
05:10:45.590 --> 05:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's the side that kind of gets
 
05:10:45.600 --> 05:10:46.868 align:start position:0%
that's that's the side that kind of gets
sidetracked

05:10:46.868 --> 05:10:46.878 align:start position:0%
sidetracked
 
05:10:49.830 --> 05:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
but what i'm what i'm trying to say is
 
05:10:51.510 --> 05:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
there are people that sit on a school
 
05:10:53.430 --> 05:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
board and because they don't happen to
 
05:10:55.110 --> 05:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority and say wait i
 
05:10:56.628 --> 05:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
want a copy of that document no you
 
05:10:57.830 --> 05:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
can't have it
 
05:10:59.270 --> 05:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
for what reason can't i just said you
 
05:10:59.280 --> 05:11:00.708 align:start position:0%
for what reason can't i just said you
couldn't

05:11:00.708 --> 05:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
05:11:02.470 --> 05:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
or this thing like i talked about where
 
05:11:04.390 --> 05:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
the superintendent forbids a member of
 
05:11:05.910 --> 05:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
the school board from being on any
 
05:11:07.350 --> 05:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
school property i don't think that's
 
05:11:09.910 --> 05:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
within his authority
 
05:11:11.990 --> 05:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to take care of those
 
05:11:14.070 --> 05:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
situations we got sidetracked on special
 
05:11:16.070 --> 05:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
ed because of all the walls that are
 
05:11:19.590 --> 05:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
there but i'll be back later when we get
 
05:11:21.750 --> 05:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
the audit and find out what we what we
 
05:11:28.628 --> 05:11:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:30.310 --> 05:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no hands raised thank
 
05:11:31.670 --> 05:11:31.680 align:start position:0%

05:11:42.628 --> 05:11:42.638 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls brian hawkins
 
05:11:54.550 --> 05:11:54.560 align:start position:0%

05:12:15.110 --> 05:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
and i'll focus my uh testimony really on
 
05:12:16.550 --> 05:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
um the
 
05:12:16.560 --> 05:12:17.670 align:start position:0%
um the
the

05:12:17.670 --> 05:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:12:22.230 --> 05:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
line five and this is uh relative to the
 
05:12:22.240 --> 05:12:23.110 align:start position:0%
line five and this is uh relative to the
uh

05:12:23.110 --> 05:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:12:25.590 --> 05:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
school district facilities documents or
 
05:12:27.910 --> 05:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
school events um specifically our
 
05:12:27.920 --> 05:12:29.030 align:start position:0%
school events um specifically our
concern

05:12:29.030 --> 05:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
concern
 
05:12:29.040 --> 05:12:29.990 align:start position:0%
concern
about

05:12:29.990 --> 05:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:12:31.590 --> 05:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
one of our concerns about this bill
 
05:12:32.788 --> 05:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:12:35.270 --> 05:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
the lack of definition of what a school
 
05:12:37.670 --> 05:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
document would be so does that and i
 
05:12:39.670 --> 05:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
think this was raised with one of the
 
05:12:42.788 --> 05:12:42.798 align:start position:0%
questions already does that include
 
05:12:44.708 --> 05:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
personnel files
 
05:12:46.868 --> 05:12:46.878 align:start position:0%
medical records tax information the
 
05:12:50.150 --> 05:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:51.750 --> 05:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's already been brought up about
 
05:12:54.390 --> 05:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
certain privacy laws
 
05:12:54.400 --> 05:12:55.430 align:start position:0%
certain privacy laws
and

05:12:55.430 --> 05:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:12:59.030 --> 05:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know as as i read this um it you
 
05:13:00.470 --> 05:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
know it does not
 
05:13:03.190 --> 05:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
um preclude any of those uh things it
 
05:13:05.270 --> 05:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
just says um documents
 
05:13:07.830 --> 05:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
and so uh we think that the bill is is
 
05:13:10.550 --> 05:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
far too broad
 
05:13:11.590 --> 05:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
and if they're
 
05:13:11.600 --> 05:13:13.190 align:start position:0%
and if they're
and

05:13:13.190 --> 05:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:13:14.948 --> 05:13:14.958 align:start position:0%
we would ask you to find it an expedient
 
05:13:16.230 --> 05:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
to legislate and i'll conclude my
 
05:13:18.868 --> 05:13:18.878 align:start position:0%
testimony right there thank you
 
05:13:20.788 --> 05:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
representative wallace thank you mr
 
05:13:21.830 --> 05:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:13:21.840 --> 05:13:22.628 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

05:13:22.628 --> 05:13:22.638 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:13:24.708 --> 05:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
um i see you're opposed to it you cited
 
05:13:26.788 --> 05:13:26.798 align:start position:0%
some reasons um i would expect you'd
 
05:13:28.868 --> 05:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
like to help us get to the bottom of
 
05:13:31.190 --> 05:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
this and make sure that we're getting
 
05:13:33.030 --> 05:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh return our investment that we're
 
05:13:34.550 --> 05:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
making into the school boards would you
 
05:13:36.390 --> 05:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
provide some suggestions on how you
 
05:13:37.750 --> 05:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
could improve this with great
 
05:13:40.070 --> 05:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
specificity so that we can move forward
 
05:13:41.430 --> 05:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
instead of just asking for it to be
 
05:13:43.350 --> 05:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
killed right out of the gate
 
05:13:45.670 --> 05:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
well i i guess from the the testimony of
 
05:13:47.270 --> 05:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and the discussion that i
 
05:13:49.670 --> 05:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
heard i was actually struggling to
 
05:13:51.910 --> 05:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
figure out what it is the sponsor was
 
05:13:54.070 --> 05:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
trying to do and so
 
05:13:55.590 --> 05:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
we would be happy to work with the
 
05:13:57.910 --> 05:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
committee in any capacity that they
 
05:14:00.390 --> 05:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
asked to to uh
 
05:14:00.400 --> 05:14:01.430 align:start position:0%
asked to to uh
but

05:14:01.430 --> 05:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:14:03.110 --> 05:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
i would i would first want to have some
 
05:14:05.510 --> 05:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
greater clarity in in terms of what the
 
05:14:05.520 --> 05:14:06.628 align:start position:0%
greater clarity in in terms of what the
sponsor

05:14:06.628 --> 05:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
05:14:08.230 --> 05:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
i think is representative pearson as the
 
05:14:11.030 --> 05:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor uh is seeking to
 
05:14:13.270 --> 05:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
accomplish so i'm and
 
05:14:15.430 --> 05:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
i see him in edna all the time i'm happy
 
05:14:24.628 --> 05:14:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:26.628 --> 05:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
recognize for a follow-up yes and can
 
05:14:28.868 --> 05:14:28.878 align:start position:0%
you speak to the um the apparent fact
 
05:14:30.150 --> 05:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire has a higher
 
05:14:32.150 --> 05:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
percentage of students that have been
 
05:14:33.910 --> 05:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
identified with an iep or in some type
 
05:14:36.150 --> 05:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
of special education program and could
 
05:14:38.470 --> 05:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
you speak to why what you what your
 
05:14:40.708 --> 05:14:40.718 align:start position:0%
opinion might be as to the cause of that
 
05:14:43.110 --> 05:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
um i i will confess representative i am
 
05:14:45.990 --> 05:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
not an expert on a special education
 
05:14:46.000 --> 05:14:48.230 align:start position:0%
not an expert on a special education
um

05:14:48.230 --> 05:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:49.750 --> 05:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
or uh
 
05:14:51.910 --> 05:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
on the iep process
 
05:14:53.990 --> 05:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
um i would say that if you if you do
 
05:14:56.230 --> 05:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
have questions about that we there is a
 
05:14:58.150 --> 05:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
there is an organization that deals with
 
05:14:59.910 --> 05:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
this a special education administrators
 
05:15:01.670 --> 05:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
association i know that they're very
 
05:15:03.910 --> 05:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable on the subject
 
05:15:06.470 --> 05:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
but i i wouldn't pretend to to to give
 
05:15:08.230 --> 05:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
you an answer to that question
 
05:15:08.240 --> 05:15:09.270 align:start position:0%
you an answer to that question
um

05:15:09.270 --> 05:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:11.590 --> 05:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh because as i said i you know i'm not
 
05:15:13.830 --> 05:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
an expert on that
 
05:15:13.840 --> 05:15:14.830 align:start position:0%
an expert on that
thank

05:15:14.830 --> 05:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:15:14.840 --> 05:15:16.390 align:start position:0%
thank
you

05:15:16.390 --> 05:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:15:17.590 --> 05:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony if the
 
05:15:20.390 --> 05:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
chair may inquire with the question
 
05:15:21.990 --> 05:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
so if an iep
 
05:15:24.310 --> 05:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
for a student exceeds
 
05:15:26.150 --> 05:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars
 
05:15:27.430 --> 05:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
05:15:28.788 --> 05:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
issue with the member of the budget
 
05:15:30.868 --> 05:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
committee whose
 
05:15:33.510 --> 05:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
job is to hopefully balance a budget
 
05:15:35.670 --> 05:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
to investigate whether that that money
 
05:15:37.030 --> 05:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
is being allocated in a responsible
 
05:15:37.040 --> 05:15:39.190 align:start position:0%
is being allocated in a responsible
manner

05:15:39.190 --> 05:15:39.200 align:start position:0%
manner
 
05:15:41.670 --> 05:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh i mean i i'm not aware of
 
05:15:43.430 --> 05:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
a reason why
 
05:15:46.628 --> 05:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
a budget committee member cannot ask
 
05:15:49.830 --> 05:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
that of an administration of
 
05:15:52.230 --> 05:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
statistics and and so forth so
 
05:15:54.310 --> 05:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh i mean our op as i said our
 
05:15:56.230 --> 05:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
opposition of the bill has more to do
 
05:15:58.390 --> 05:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
with the way it is written and and the
 
05:16:02.230 --> 05:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
broadness with which it has been uh
 
05:16:04.230 --> 05:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
as i said the broadness with it which it
 
05:16:05.510 --> 05:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
has been um
 
05:16:07.030 --> 05:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
written so
 
05:16:07.040 --> 05:16:08.470 align:start position:0%
written so
and

05:16:08.470 --> 05:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:16:10.390 --> 05:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
i'll follow up that question and thank
 
05:16:12.390 --> 05:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
05:16:15.430 --> 05:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
some ieps they can be 30 40 50 pages you
 
05:16:17.430 --> 05:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
know as a
 
05:16:19.670 --> 05:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
four or five something summary
 
05:16:21.350 --> 05:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
although may
 
05:16:23.510 --> 05:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's a summary it may not necessarily i
 
05:16:25.510 --> 05:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
think what i understood the testimony
 
05:16:26.868 --> 05:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:16:28.708 --> 05:16:28.718 align:start position:0%
representative introduced the bill was
 
05:16:30.310 --> 05:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
they wanted to see if the student was
 
05:16:32.070 --> 05:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
making progress and that's not
 
05:16:33.430 --> 05:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily a negative reflection on the
 
05:16:33.440 --> 05:16:34.470 align:start position:0%
necessarily a negative reflection on the
iep

05:16:34.470 --> 05:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
iep
 
05:16:37.670 --> 05:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
but if this district spending over a
 
05:16:40.868 --> 05:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars a year
 
05:16:42.310 --> 05:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
i guess what is the concern with with
 
05:16:42.320 --> 05:16:43.670 align:start position:0%
i guess what is the concern with with
having

05:16:43.670 --> 05:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
having
 
05:16:43.680 --> 05:16:44.708 align:start position:0%
having
some

05:16:44.708 --> 05:16:44.718 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:16:46.550 --> 05:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
someone evaluate whether that that's
 
05:16:48.150 --> 05:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
money's being used you know in a
 
05:16:49.510 --> 05:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
responsible manner on behalf of the
 
05:16:49.520 --> 05:16:51.030 align:start position:0%
responsible manner on behalf of the
taxpayer

05:16:51.030 --> 05:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
05:16:52.628 --> 05:16:52.638 align:start position:0%
what's the opposition to that i don't
 
05:16:54.948 --> 05:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
have any opposition to
 
05:16:57.670 --> 05:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
a school board member or a
 
05:16:59.510 --> 05:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
budget committee member asking questions
 
05:17:01.910 --> 05:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
about the performance of their school
 
05:17:03.430 --> 05:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
about the performance of the programs
 
05:17:05.350 --> 05:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
that they have in their school
 
05:17:07.670 --> 05:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
what what i'm here saying to you
 
05:17:08.868 --> 05:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:17:11.110 --> 05:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
this goes well beyond that
 
05:17:11.120 --> 05:17:12.230 align:start position:0%
this goes well beyond that
and

05:17:12.230 --> 05:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:17:15.030 --> 05:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
and for you to pass this uh into law i
 
05:17:18.150 --> 05:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
think is going well beyond maybe
 
05:17:18.160 --> 05:17:19.110 align:start position:0%
think is going well beyond maybe
um

05:17:19.110 --> 05:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:20.708 --> 05:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
when we get to the bottom of this is
 
05:17:22.390 --> 05:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
what what the what the actual
 
05:17:22.400 --> 05:17:23.350 align:start position:0%
what what the what the actual
intent

05:17:23.350 --> 05:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
intent
 
05:17:27.030 --> 05:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
of the of the bill is so uh all i have
 
05:17:27.040 --> 05:17:27.830 align:start position:0%
of the of the bill is so uh all i have
is

05:17:27.830 --> 05:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:17:29.590 --> 05:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
the bill that was
 
05:17:31.590 --> 05:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh issued to the public and and put
 
05:17:33.670 --> 05:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
forward for a public hearing and so
 
05:17:33.680 --> 05:17:35.670 align:start position:0%
forward for a public hearing and so
um

05:17:35.670 --> 05:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:37.430 --> 05:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
05:17:38.628 --> 05:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
not sure there's much more i can tell
 
05:17:46.230 --> 05:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:48.788 --> 05:17:48.798 align:start position:0%
representative boardney
 
05:17:51.110 --> 05:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
05:17:53.510 --> 05:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh since i'm not on the education
 
05:17:55.750 --> 05:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
committee i really don't understand the
 
05:17:57.510 --> 05:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
workings of uh
 
05:18:00.948 --> 05:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
of what is all going on as far as budget
 
05:18:00.958 --> 05:18:02.550 align:start position:0%
of what is all going on as far as budget
but

05:18:02.550 --> 05:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:18:04.628 --> 05:18:04.638 align:start position:0%
representative wilder brought up
 
05:18:07.750 --> 05:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh a problem with audits now
 
05:18:10.470 --> 05:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
what are are our school
 
05:18:10.480 --> 05:18:13.590 align:start position:0%
what are are our school
uh

05:18:13.590 --> 05:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:16.310 --> 05:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
budgets audited on an annual basis or
 
05:18:19.510 --> 05:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
what what is the basis for audits for
 
05:18:22.708 --> 05:18:22.718 align:start position:0%
uh school expenses sure uh if
 
05:18:22.718 --> 05:18:23.670 align:start position:0%
uh school expenses sure uh if
if

05:18:23.670 --> 05:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:18:25.990 --> 05:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
i would be happy to to get back to you
 
05:18:28.070 --> 05:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
with that i would also say i think
 
05:18:30.230 --> 05:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
following me is uh
 
05:18:31.270 --> 05:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
represented from the school boards
 
05:18:33.110 --> 05:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
association who might have a little bit
 
05:18:36.150 --> 05:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
more insight in terms of into the the
 
05:18:38.550 --> 05:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
the budgetary and audit questions
 
05:18:46.310 --> 05:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:47.990 --> 05:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
sue newman
 
05:18:52.070 --> 05:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:55.910 --> 05:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
mr hawkins do you have any thoughts on
 
05:18:55.920 --> 05:18:57.190 align:start position:0%
mr hawkins do you have any thoughts on
um

05:18:57.190 --> 05:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:00.310 --> 05:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
on what would be in these times i'll say
 
05:19:02.070 --> 05:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
over the last 10
 
05:19:03.590 --> 05:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
10 years or
 
05:19:05.110 --> 05:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
to currently
 
05:19:07.030 --> 05:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
on what would be
 
05:19:09.510 --> 05:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
problematic with a
 
05:19:12.470 --> 05:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
an elected board member just going on to
 
05:19:15.190 --> 05:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
or trying to go out into or onto a
 
05:19:16.708 --> 05:19:16.718 align:start position:0%
school property
 
05:19:19.510 --> 05:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
almost at any time that they think is a
 
05:19:21.590 --> 05:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
right thing to do and that would be
 
05:19:23.990 --> 05:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
for um building
 
05:19:26.550 --> 05:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
personnel including teachers if you have
 
05:19:28.470 --> 05:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
any thoughts on that
 
05:19:30.470 --> 05:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
i guess that goes back to some of the
 
05:19:32.150 --> 05:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
the clarity of
 
05:19:34.150 --> 05:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
or lack of definition in in the bill so
 
05:19:35.030 --> 05:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
what does
 
05:19:37.270 --> 05:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
what would count as a school event
 
05:19:40.830 --> 05:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
um you know does that mean
 
05:19:43.430 --> 05:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
um a football game
 
05:19:45.350 --> 05:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
or does that mean
 
05:19:45.360 --> 05:19:46.390 align:start position:0%
or does that mean
um

05:19:46.390 --> 05:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:47.270 --> 05:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:19:49.510 --> 05:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
a vaccine clinic that's happening i i
 
05:19:51.910 --> 05:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
don't know what the school event is as
 
05:19:53.430 --> 05:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's defined in this bill and i don't
 
05:19:55.750 --> 05:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
want to bring in that issue into
 
05:19:59.110 --> 05:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
this discussion but uh i in in in
 
05:20:01.270 --> 05:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
sitting to answer to try and answer your
 
05:20:03.910 --> 05:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
question um i think that's one of our
 
05:20:06.470 --> 05:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
major uh concerns with the bill is the
 
05:20:09.750 --> 05:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:15.590 --> 05:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:17.910 --> 05:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative testament
 
05:20:19.270 --> 05:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
begin with you're going to yell at me
 
05:20:20.868 --> 05:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
because it's not really a question
 
05:20:24.310 --> 05:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
schools are audited every year
 
05:20:26.548 --> 05:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
and but they're just on
 
05:20:30.070 --> 05:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:31.750 --> 05:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
what i believe right
 
05:20:35.430 --> 05:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:37.110 --> 05:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
you just you basically gaveled yourself
 
05:20:39.110 --> 05:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
before i could
 
05:20:39.120 --> 05:20:40.390 align:start position:0%
before i could
with

05:20:40.390 --> 05:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:20:43.190 --> 05:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
you'll have you'll have time to make
 
05:20:45.030 --> 05:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
open ended statements or general
 
05:20:47.030 --> 05:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
whatever statements you want during the
 
05:20:52.150 --> 05:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:52.160 --> 05:20:53.270 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:20:53.270 --> 05:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:20:54.310 --> 05:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
with respect to the witness you don't
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
need to respond to
 
05:20:58.390 --> 05:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
the stable i appreciate the committee's
 
05:21:00.390 --> 05:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
time thank you
 
05:21:03.430 --> 05:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:06.150 --> 05:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
we now call barrett christina from the
 
05:21:15.430 --> 05:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:17.350 --> 05:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you members
 
05:21:18.948 --> 05:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
05:21:20.548 --> 05:21:20.558 align:start position:0%
is barrett christina i'm the executive
 
05:21:21.830 --> 05:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
director of the new hampshire school
 
05:21:23.590 --> 05:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
boards association
 
05:21:25.510 --> 05:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not in front of this committee often
 
05:21:26.628 --> 05:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
if ever
 
05:21:28.788 --> 05:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
so just by way of background we are a
 
05:21:31.110 --> 05:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
private nonprofit organization we
 
05:21:34.150 --> 05:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
represent approximately 161 school
 
05:21:35.750 --> 05:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
boards across the state providing a
 
05:21:38.470 --> 05:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
variety of services training assistants
 
05:21:40.230 --> 05:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
things of that nature and also
 
05:21:43.110 --> 05:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
legislative advocacy so we are opposed
 
05:21:46.230 --> 05:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
to house bill 1072 for a number of the
 
05:21:48.230 --> 05:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
reasons that have already been stated
 
05:21:49.910 --> 05:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
and some of the questions that have
 
05:21:51.910 --> 05:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
already been uh presented
 
05:21:53.510 --> 05:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
from this committee
 
05:21:55.590 --> 05:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
primarily when we're talking to focus on
 
05:21:57.110 --> 05:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
the documents aspect first and
 
05:21:59.670 --> 05:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
unfettered access to to documents within
 
05:22:01.190 --> 05:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
05:22:03.030 --> 05:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
as has already been mentioned
 
05:22:05.030 --> 05:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know nhsba would have significant
 
05:22:07.270 --> 05:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
concerns if a school board member had
 
05:22:09.750 --> 05:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
unfettered access to a student record
 
05:22:11.830 --> 05:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
i know a lot of the conversation
 
05:22:14.070 --> 05:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
was about special education i'll tell
 
05:22:15.350 --> 05:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
you right now anything relative to
 
05:22:17.430 --> 05:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
special education is deemed confidential
 
05:22:19.590 --> 05:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
under both state and federal law
 
05:22:22.470 --> 05:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
department of education rule 1119
 
05:22:24.310 --> 05:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
confidentiality requirements there's a
 
05:22:27.030 --> 05:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
whole section in state rules from the
 
05:22:28.310 --> 05:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
department of education they're already
 
05:22:31.110 --> 05:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
talking about the confidentiality of
 
05:22:33.990 --> 05:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
of of special education records further
 
05:22:36.788 --> 05:22:36.798 align:start position:0%
and more expansive than that nhsba
 
05:22:39.030 --> 05:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
argues that anything within a student
 
05:22:42.150 --> 05:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
record is absolutely not fit for
 
05:22:45.430 --> 05:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
anybody's consumption a board member
 
05:22:47.430 --> 05:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know teachers administrators special
 
05:22:49.430 --> 05:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
education staff on sort of a need to
 
05:22:51.990 --> 05:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
know basis if you will to help provide
 
05:22:53.830 --> 05:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
education services to that child
 
05:22:55.590 --> 05:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
certainly they would have access to
 
05:22:57.990 --> 05:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
records within that student file
 
05:22:59.990 --> 05:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
but student records just you know as a
 
05:23:02.548 --> 05:23:02.558 align:start position:0%
blank statement should be locked up
 
05:23:05.430 --> 05:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
the second aspect relative to employee
 
05:23:05.440 --> 05:23:07.110 align:start position:0%
the second aspect relative to employee
files

05:23:07.110 --> 05:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
files
 
05:23:09.750 --> 05:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know nhsba is often advocated that
 
05:23:12.390 --> 05:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
if push came to shove if a school board
 
05:23:13.990 --> 05:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
which i think is another interesting
 
05:23:15.670 --> 05:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
aspect this talks about a school board
 
05:23:15.680 --> 05:23:16.548 align:start position:0%
aspect this talks about a school board
member

05:23:16.548 --> 05:23:16.558 align:start position:0%
member
 
05:23:18.310 --> 05:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
school boards operate as a collective
 
05:23:20.150 --> 05:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
entity if you look at the department of
 
05:23:22.230 --> 05:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
the rules of new hampshire the statutes
 
05:23:23.350 --> 05:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
that deal with
 
05:23:25.030 --> 05:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
all the statutes impacting school
 
05:23:27.910 --> 05:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
districts they're 1500 pages long
 
05:23:29.990 --> 05:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
it talks collectively the board the
 
05:23:31.830 --> 05:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
board the board there are a couple
 
05:23:33.270 --> 05:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
provisions in their right to know law
 
05:23:35.270 --> 05:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
that give authority to a chairperson for
 
05:23:37.350 --> 05:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
example to call a special special
 
05:23:39.110 --> 05:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
meeting of a public body or an emergency
 
05:23:41.190 --> 05:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
meeting of a public body but in the
 
05:23:43.270 --> 05:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
educational context the board has to
 
05:23:46.230 --> 05:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
operate as a collective entity as a
 
05:23:49.750 --> 05:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
as a as a a single body if you will
 
05:23:51.110 --> 05:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in law that gives
 
05:23:52.788 --> 05:23:52.798 align:start position:0%
individual rights to individual school
 
05:23:54.230 --> 05:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
board members i think that's important
 
05:23:55.830 --> 05:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
to note as well too
 
05:23:58.948 --> 05:23:58.958 align:start position:0%
but so relative to the employee
 
05:24:02.868 --> 05:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
the employee files um you know if if an
 
05:24:05.030 --> 05:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
employee is before the school board for
 
05:24:06.948 --> 05:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
a hearing whether or not that's a
 
05:24:09.590 --> 05:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
non-renewal a termination a disciplinary
 
05:24:09.600 --> 05:24:10.548 align:start position:0%
non-renewal a termination a disciplinary
hearing

05:24:10.548 --> 05:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:24:12.150 --> 05:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
the pertinent documents will be
 
05:24:13.590 --> 05:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
presented at that hearing the
 
05:24:13.600 --> 05:24:15.110 align:start position:0%
presented at that hearing the
evaluations

05:24:15.110 --> 05:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
evaluations
 
05:24:17.750 --> 05:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
um the employee reviews but there's
 
05:24:19.990 --> 05:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
other personal confidential information
 
05:24:22.070 --> 05:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
that may be within an employee personnel
 
05:24:24.788 --> 05:24:24.798 align:start position:0%
file perhaps they had to take disability
 
05:24:26.310 --> 05:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
leave perhaps they're on some sort of
 
05:24:26.320 --> 05:24:27.830 align:start position:0%
leave perhaps they're on some sort of
504

05:24:27.830 --> 05:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
504
 
05:24:29.990 --> 05:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
plan where they need accommodations um
 
05:24:31.510 --> 05:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
within their within their workplace
 
05:24:33.750 --> 05:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
other medical information if you will
 
05:24:36.788 --> 05:24:36.798 align:start position:0%
maybe in in an employee's personnel file
 
05:24:40.470 --> 05:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
that should be confidential as well too
 
05:24:43.270 --> 05:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
relative to the access to facilities i
 
05:24:45.510 --> 05:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
guess my first question would be for
 
05:24:47.350 --> 05:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
what purpose is that individual school
 
05:24:49.030 --> 05:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
board member
 
05:24:50.390 --> 05:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
coming to the school
 
05:24:53.190 --> 05:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
and asking to be to to to enter the
 
05:24:53.200 --> 05:24:54.390 align:start position:0%
and asking to be to to to enter the
school

05:24:54.390 --> 05:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:24:56.230 --> 05:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
you know we have some sample policies
 
05:24:58.230 --> 05:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
and we would advise the school board you
 
05:24:59.830 --> 05:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
know the school board member if you
 
05:25:01.830 --> 05:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
would like to view the school talk to
 
05:25:03.510 --> 05:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
the superintendent talk to the principal
 
05:25:05.590 --> 05:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
and make an appointment rather than just
 
05:25:08.868 --> 05:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
just showing up um you know is it too
 
05:25:12.150 --> 05:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
you know is it to to to just to observe
 
05:25:13.670 --> 05:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
you know we can't have
 
05:25:15.430 --> 05:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
people just kind of coming coming in and
 
05:25:16.788 --> 05:25:16.798 align:start position:0%
out of a school building and walking in
 
05:25:18.548 --> 05:25:18.558 align:start position:0%
and out of in and out of classrooms
 
05:25:19.910 --> 05:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
where there may be confidential
 
05:25:22.628 --> 05:25:22.638 align:start position:0%
information going on or or observing
 
05:25:24.948 --> 05:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
students or things of that nature but
 
05:25:26.548 --> 05:25:26.558 align:start position:0%
you know are they coming in to make sure
 
05:25:27.430 --> 05:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
that the
 
05:25:29.350 --> 05:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance guy fixed the boiler or put
 
05:25:31.350 --> 05:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
the windows in the right way you know
 
05:25:32.868 --> 05:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some sort of purpose
 
05:25:35.190 --> 05:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
behind this so you know unfettered
 
05:25:36.868 --> 05:25:36.878 align:start position:0%
access to the facilities i know maybe
 
05:25:38.390 --> 05:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
make a phone call and talk to your
 
05:25:39.910 --> 05:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent rebuilding principal and
 
05:25:41.830 --> 05:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
say i'd like to come down and see how
 
05:25:43.830 --> 05:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
the the the maintenance project is
 
05:25:45.670 --> 05:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
coming along i'd like to come down and
 
05:25:47.350 --> 05:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
and see how the new gymnasium is coming
 
05:25:50.150 --> 05:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
along some things of that nature so um
 
05:25:51.830 --> 05:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
relative to some of the special
 
05:25:54.390 --> 05:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
education concerns that were that were
 
05:25:55.990 --> 05:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
that were being talked about and
 
05:25:58.470 --> 05:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
discussed you know the money is one
 
05:26:01.350 --> 05:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
thing but the how and the why a student
 
05:26:03.270 --> 05:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
is getting services and who's providing
 
05:26:06.390 --> 05:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
them um that's between the parents and
 
05:26:08.548 --> 05:26:08.558 align:start position:0%
and the school district staff of whether
 
05:26:10.708 --> 05:26:10.718 align:start position:0%
or not the kid is making significant
 
05:26:13.270 --> 05:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
educational progress under the iep
 
05:26:14.868 --> 05:26:14.878 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:26:16.150 --> 05:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
could a school board or a budget
 
05:26:18.470 --> 05:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
committee in the aggregate get how much
 
05:26:19.990 --> 05:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
money are we spending on special
 
05:26:22.548 --> 05:26:22.558 align:start position:0%
education yes could they get numbers in
 
05:26:25.190 --> 05:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
the aggregate how many paraprofessionals
 
05:26:27.030 --> 05:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
are we have on staff that are providing
 
05:26:29.030 --> 05:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
special education services
 
05:26:32.150 --> 05:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
yes um but asking how much of this
 
05:26:34.150 --> 05:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
placement cost for this particular kid
 
05:26:35.910 --> 05:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
and how many paraprofessionals and aides
 
05:26:38.230 --> 05:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
for this particular kid in our opinion
 
05:26:40.070 --> 05:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
would would be touching on the
 
05:26:41.750 --> 05:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
confidentiality aspect that you're not
 
05:26:43.270 --> 05:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
allowed that you're not allowed to
 
05:26:43.280 --> 05:26:44.390 align:start position:0%
allowed that you're not allowed to
breach

05:26:44.390 --> 05:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
breach
 
05:26:44.400 --> 05:26:45.350 align:start position:0%
breach
last

05:26:45.350 --> 05:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
last
 
05:26:47.430 --> 05:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
and i'll conclude my testimony there was
 
05:26:49.350 --> 05:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
some discussion i think among this
 
05:26:50.628 --> 05:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
committee and among
 
05:26:52.788 --> 05:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
representative weiler about redacting
 
05:26:55.190 --> 05:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
some of the particular records
 
05:26:57.190 --> 05:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
i just want to let you know that there's
 
05:26:59.270 --> 05:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
nothing in law the right to know law
 
05:27:01.430 --> 05:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
about redacting documents it's a
 
05:27:03.350 --> 05:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
judicial creation
 
05:27:05.510 --> 05:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
we all live with it we all do that as
 
05:27:07.270 --> 05:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
needed a request comes in under the
 
05:27:09.350 --> 05:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
right to no law it's passed off to a
 
05:27:11.110 --> 05:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
school district attorney they go through
 
05:27:12.788 --> 05:27:12.798 align:start position:0%
make recommendations as to what can be
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
redacted and what should be made public
 
05:27:15.830 --> 05:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
but i just want to let you know there's
 
05:27:17.510 --> 05:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
nothing in law that speaks to redaction
 
05:27:19.350 --> 05:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
of documents it's a judicial creation
 
05:27:22.070 --> 05:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
that public bodies have sort of adapted
 
05:27:23.990 --> 05:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
to and adjusted to over the last i want
 
05:27:25.230 --> 05:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
to think that was in
 
05:27:27.910 --> 05:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
1989 when the court created that
 
05:27:30.070 --> 05:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
standard on their right to no law so um
 
05:27:32.948 --> 05:27:32.958 align:start position:0%
with that we um we we oppose the bill we
 
05:27:35.190 --> 05:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
think it's way too broad we think that
 
05:27:36.470 --> 05:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
school boards would be setting
 
05:27:38.310 --> 05:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
themselves up for liability if they gave
 
05:27:40.230 --> 05:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
unfettered access to some of these
 
05:27:42.150 --> 05:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
records and with that i'm pretty happy
 
05:27:43.510 --> 05:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions the committee
 
05:27:45.830 --> 05:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
may have
 
05:27:48.470 --> 05:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and if the
 
05:27:50.310 --> 05:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
chair would like to inquire with a
 
05:27:52.708 --> 05:27:52.718 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for taking my
 
05:27:52.718 --> 05:27:54.788 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for taking my
question

05:27:54.788 --> 05:27:54.798 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:27:55.990 --> 05:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
if a member of the school board is
 
05:27:58.230 --> 05:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
elected by
 
05:28:00.070 --> 05:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
by the people
 
05:28:02.070 --> 05:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
what why is there a concern whether a
 
05:28:03.750 --> 05:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
member of the school board
 
05:28:03.760 --> 05:28:04.788 align:start position:0%
member of the school board
would

05:28:04.788 --> 05:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:28:07.430 --> 05:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
show up at a public school to observe
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
how the school's operating so i mean
 
05:28:10.548 --> 05:28:10.558 align:start position:0%
they have to state their reason for
 
05:28:12.310 --> 05:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
being it doesn't seem
 
05:28:13.590 --> 05:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering what is the concern
 
05:28:14.628 --> 05:28:14.638 align:start position:0%
with that
 
05:28:15.510 --> 05:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:28:18.150 --> 05:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
representative um well when we have
 
05:28:20.390 --> 05:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
students within the facility
 
05:28:22.788 --> 05:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
um there is private confidential
 
05:28:24.948 --> 05:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
information occurring or private
 
05:28:26.948 --> 05:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
confidential events happening within a
 
05:28:28.948 --> 05:28:28.958 align:start position:0%
school district i'm not saying that you
 
05:28:30.948 --> 05:28:30.958 align:start position:0%
know that they need to have a purpose
 
05:28:32.310 --> 05:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
and that purpose needs to be somehow
 
05:28:34.070 --> 05:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
authorized by the superintendent or the
 
05:28:35.830 --> 05:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
school board but
 
05:28:37.430 --> 05:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know because we have kids in the
 
05:28:39.750 --> 05:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
facility we can't just let people come
 
05:28:41.750 --> 05:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
walking in i understand it may be an
 
05:28:43.910 --> 05:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
elected official but you know i guess it
 
05:28:45.430 --> 05:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
goes back to looking at the particular
 
05:28:48.628 --> 05:28:48.638 align:start position:0%
statutes and laws in individual elected
 
05:28:51.110 --> 05:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
official schools
 
05:28:52.948 --> 05:28:52.958 align:start position:0%
town select boards city councilors
 
05:28:54.628 --> 05:28:54.638 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily given any other
 
05:28:56.548 --> 05:28:56.558 align:start position:0%
particular rights beyond anybody else
 
05:28:58.788 --> 05:28:58.798 align:start position:0%
other than the right to attend a meeting
 
05:29:01.190 --> 05:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
and participate in the discussion and
 
05:29:04.310 --> 05:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
and vote for example sir you know
 
05:29:07.030 --> 05:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
you're an elected official you have a an
 
05:29:08.470 --> 05:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
employee over here i don't think that
 
05:29:10.948 --> 05:29:10.958 align:start position:0%
gives you any right to perhaps look at
 
05:29:13.030 --> 05:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
his employee personnel file i presume he
 
05:29:14.868 --> 05:29:14.878 align:start position:0%
has a boss that that does that i know
 
05:29:16.070 --> 05:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's not in the just with your
 
05:29:18.390 --> 05:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
question about looking at facilities um
 
05:29:20.470 --> 05:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
i will also say too that the last year
 
05:29:22.628 --> 05:29:22.638 align:start position:0%
and a half or so since we've still been
 
05:29:24.708 --> 05:29:24.718 align:start position:0%
in the midst of the pandemic pandemic
 
05:29:26.548 --> 05:29:26.558 align:start position:0%
school districts have tried to
 
05:29:28.310 --> 05:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
significantly limit who's coming in and
 
05:29:30.390 --> 05:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
who's going out of the building just for
 
05:29:33.670 --> 05:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:35.990 --> 05:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
if i just may fall but
 
05:29:37.590 --> 05:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure the policy of every school
 
05:29:39.670 --> 05:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
i can speak for the high school in salem
 
05:29:41.990 --> 05:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
rockingham county district 8.
 
05:29:43.750 --> 05:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
i walk in i have a name tag i graduated
 
05:29:45.750 --> 05:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
from that school i'm an elected official
 
05:29:47.910 --> 05:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
for that district they
 
05:29:50.310 --> 05:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
i still sign in sign out just just like
 
05:29:52.310 --> 05:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
everyone else you don't just
 
05:29:53.510 --> 05:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not talking about just walking in
 
05:29:55.590 --> 05:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
like it's like it's a sure it's a you
 
05:29:57.110 --> 05:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
know grocery store i'm just wondering
 
05:29:58.948 --> 05:29:58.958 align:start position:0%
what is the concern with having
 
05:30:01.430 --> 05:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
members of the school board
 
05:30:03.350 --> 05:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
maybe making unannounced visits to see
 
05:30:05.830 --> 05:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
really the school operating in its
 
05:30:07.670 --> 05:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
regular form not uh
 
05:30:09.110 --> 05:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
to make to see what's going on i was
 
05:30:10.868 --> 05:30:10.878 align:start position:0%
wondering what the concern is
 
05:30:13.190 --> 05:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um represent
 
05:30:15.030 --> 05:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you for for
 
05:30:17.030 --> 05:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
clarifying i mean most i don't think
 
05:30:18.628 --> 05:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
there is necessarily a problem i mean i
 
05:30:19.910 --> 05:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
think school boards prop most school
 
05:30:21.910 --> 05:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
boards have a policy or the building
 
05:30:23.750 --> 05:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
will have a protocol where you come in
 
05:30:25.270 --> 05:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
you get buzzed in you identify yourself
 
05:30:28.390 --> 05:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps show an id get a name badge but
 
05:30:30.548 --> 05:30:30.558 align:start position:0%
do they let you and you know i'm not
 
05:30:32.628 --> 05:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
i'm asking someone hypothetically sir i
 
05:30:33.750 --> 05:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
mean do they let you just come in and
 
05:30:35.910 --> 05:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
walk around
 
05:30:37.190 --> 05:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
i mean i
 
05:30:38.788 --> 05:30:38.798 align:start position:0%
and i know it's not my place to be
 
05:30:40.548 --> 05:30:40.558 align:start position:0%
asking questions of the committee i
 
05:30:42.150 --> 05:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
would find that peculiar if they let
 
05:30:43.670 --> 05:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
anybody just come in and start walking
 
05:30:45.510 --> 05:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
around ability elected official or not
 
05:30:45.520 --> 05:30:48.948 align:start position:0%
around ability elected official or not
sir

05:30:48.948 --> 05:30:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:51.190 --> 05:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
well i'm referring specifically members
 
05:30:52.628 --> 05:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
of the school board
 
05:30:54.548 --> 05:30:54.558 align:start position:0%
right not not myself i'm not a member of
 
05:30:55.430 --> 05:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
the school
 
05:30:57.110 --> 05:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
any elected official school board member
 
05:30:59.590 --> 05:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
i mean if if if the board wanted to do
 
05:31:01.910 --> 05:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
that or i mean or the the board wanted
 
05:31:04.150 --> 05:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
to pass a protocol that you know it can
 
05:31:06.070 --> 05:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
do that
 
05:31:07.990 --> 05:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
i think that would be fine and you know
 
05:31:10.390 --> 05:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
if a board member wants to
 
05:31:12.310 --> 05:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
you know like any other visitors and
 
05:31:15.430 --> 05:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the sample policy we have
 
05:31:17.510 --> 05:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know all persons other than staff
 
05:31:19.270 --> 05:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
and pupils enrolled the school
 
05:31:21.270 --> 05:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
who may come to to the school for any
 
05:31:22.230 --> 05:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
reason during the school day are
 
05:31:23.750 --> 05:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
considered visitors and must report and
 
05:31:25.910 --> 05:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
sign in at the office no objection to
 
05:31:25.920 --> 05:31:26.868 align:start position:0%
sign in at the office no objection to
that

05:31:26.868 --> 05:31:26.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:31:28.868 --> 05:31:28.878 align:start position:0%
employees of the school system
 
05:31:30.470 --> 05:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
are to advise the school principal or
 
05:31:31.910 --> 05:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
secretary that they are in the building
 
05:31:34.070 --> 05:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
a visitor
 
05:31:35.510 --> 05:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
must report to the school office and
 
05:31:37.030 --> 05:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
receive permission to be on school
 
05:31:37.040 --> 05:31:38.230 align:start position:0%
receive permission to be on school
grounds

05:31:38.230 --> 05:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
grounds
 
05:31:39.750 --> 05:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
maybe we could make some language to
 
05:31:41.910 --> 05:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
amend that there persons wishing to meet
 
05:31:43.270 --> 05:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
with a teacher
 
05:31:44.788 --> 05:31:44.798 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of discussing a
 
05:31:47.270 --> 05:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
particular problem shall do so
 
05:31:49.670 --> 05:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
at a time when it does not rough normal
 
05:31:51.510 --> 05:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
school program persons wishing to make
 
05:31:53.110 --> 05:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
arrangements may do so by securing an
 
05:31:55.350 --> 05:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
appointment with the teacher through the
 
05:31:57.030 --> 05:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
office of the principal or by direct
 
05:31:59.350 --> 05:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
contact with the teacher no person shall
 
05:32:00.868 --> 05:32:00.878 align:start position:0%
visit a school without first reporting
 
05:32:03.030 --> 05:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
in the office of the principal as to the
 
05:32:05.430 --> 05:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
purpose and in place of the visit that
 
05:32:07.990 --> 05:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
one sample policy we we have
 
05:32:12.788 --> 05:32:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:15.910 --> 05:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:17.430 --> 05:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:32:17.440 --> 05:32:19.110 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

05:32:19.110 --> 05:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:32:20.948 --> 05:32:20.958 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to say if you would
 
05:32:23.430 --> 05:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
look at line 9 of the
 
05:32:25.830 --> 05:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
of the law that says
 
05:32:28.868 --> 05:32:28.878 align:start position:0%
any person denying access in violation
 
05:32:30.390 --> 05:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
of this section
 
05:32:33.430 --> 05:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
shall be guilty of a class b misdemeanor
 
05:32:35.030 --> 05:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to say that that's
 
05:32:38.070 --> 05:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a reach beyond what the kind
 
05:32:40.390 --> 05:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
of relationship that school boards have
 
05:32:42.628 --> 05:32:42.638 align:start position:0%
with principals and administration
 
05:32:46.470 --> 05:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:47.350 --> 05:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:32:49.670 --> 05:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative yes nhsba would certainly
 
05:32:51.990 --> 05:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
oppose that the language that language
 
05:32:53.990 --> 05:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill as well too you know trying
 
05:32:57.270 --> 05:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
to criminalize something such as that um
 
05:33:02.150 --> 05:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:05.190 --> 05:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:09.430 --> 05:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:12.070 --> 05:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:33:12.080 --> 05:33:14.310 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
this

05:33:14.310 --> 05:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:33:17.990 --> 05:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
this bill has documents in four
 
05:33:18.000 --> 05:33:19.190 align:start position:0%
this bill has documents in four
sentences

05:33:19.190 --> 05:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
sentences
 
05:33:23.110 --> 05:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
if that documents wasn't there
 
05:33:25.590 --> 05:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
and it was just to facilitate
 
05:33:27.670 --> 05:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
what the problem was that created this
 
05:33:29.670 --> 05:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
bill in the first place
 
05:33:32.390 --> 05:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
would you then be opposed to it i thank
 
05:33:33.510 --> 05:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative
 
05:33:35.030 --> 05:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
could i ask you to repeat the first part
 
05:33:37.430 --> 05:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
of your question i missed that sir
 
05:33:40.548 --> 05:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
well it says documents here
 
05:33:42.548 --> 05:33:42.558 align:start position:0%
i'm familiar with the situation that
 
05:33:44.788 --> 05:33:44.798 align:start position:0%
created this bill okay
 
05:33:47.750 --> 05:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
and the documents were not a question to
 
05:33:49.510 --> 05:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
me the individual
 
05:33:50.868 --> 05:33:50.878 align:start position:0%
made a statement
 
05:33:52.788 --> 05:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
the superintendent overreacted and
 
05:33:54.390 --> 05:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
borrowed him from the property now how
 
05:33:57.750 --> 05:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
can he do his job when he's elected
 
05:34:00.708 --> 05:34:00.718 align:start position:0%
he should have access to the facility
 
05:34:02.470 --> 05:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
would you not agree thank you for the
 
05:34:05.270 --> 05:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
question uh representative yes if
 
05:34:07.430 --> 05:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
a school board member wants to view the
 
05:34:10.868 --> 05:34:10.878 align:start position:0%
property nhsba has no objection to that
 
05:34:13.430 --> 05:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
um the the situation in and of itself
 
05:34:15.990 --> 05:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with that you know i
 
05:34:17.990 --> 05:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
would argue that you know if it was one
 
05:34:18.000 --> 05:34:19.510 align:start position:0%
would argue that you know if it was one
situation

05:34:19.510 --> 05:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:34:21.190 --> 05:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
you know one time with one school board
 
05:34:23.270 --> 05:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
member and one superintendent i think
 
05:34:24.548 --> 05:34:24.558 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned the anecdotal
 
05:34:26.628 --> 05:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
evidence what may not be anecdotal what
 
05:34:28.070 --> 05:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
may have actually happened i don't know
 
05:34:29.910 --> 05:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
if we need to change the law it sounds
 
05:34:31.350 --> 05:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
like an employment issue more than
 
05:34:33.830 --> 05:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
anything between the school board and
 
05:34:36.548 --> 05:34:36.558 align:start position:0%
and and and the superintendent
 
05:34:41.590 --> 05:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:43.750 --> 05:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
i think what what got me
 
05:34:45.430 --> 05:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
fired up about this is the fact that
 
05:34:47.670 --> 05:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about all kinds of records
 
05:34:49.750 --> 05:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
and employee records and everything else
 
05:34:51.590 --> 05:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's not part of the bill i don't
 
05:34:53.510 --> 05:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
think that was the intent
 
05:34:55.430 --> 05:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
and it just seems that we wasted an
 
05:34:57.190 --> 05:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
awful lot of time talking about all
 
05:34:59.510 --> 05:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
these different things
 
05:34:59.520 --> 05:35:00.548 align:start position:0%
these different things
and

05:35:00.548 --> 05:35:00.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:35:02.310 --> 05:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
i know the documents are listed in the
 
05:35:04.470 --> 05:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
bill but if they weren't there shouldn't
 
05:35:06.788 --> 05:35:06.798 align:start position:0%
be a problem should they
 
05:35:09.430 --> 05:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
05:35:10.230 --> 05:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:35:12.070 --> 05:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative well i mean is the intent
 
05:35:12.080 --> 05:35:12.948 align:start position:0%
representative well i mean is the intent
to

05:35:12.948 --> 05:35:12.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:35:14.948 --> 05:35:14.958 align:start position:0%
mean documents or is intended to mean
 
05:35:16.708 --> 05:35:16.718 align:start position:0%
public records because those may be two
 
05:35:18.390 --> 05:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
different things
 
05:35:20.628 --> 05:35:20.638 align:start position:0%
a public record has a as a definition
 
05:35:23.750 --> 05:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
within rsa91a has exemptions within rsa
 
05:35:23.760 --> 05:35:25.110 align:start position:0%

91a
 
05:35:27.190 --> 05:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
5 i believe it is so
 
05:35:28.948 --> 05:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
you know a document within the
 
05:35:30.708 --> 05:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
possession of a school district may not
 
05:35:33.030 --> 05:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
be a public record
 
05:35:36.628 --> 05:35:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:38.628 --> 05:35:38.638 align:start position:0%

the size of your budget
 
05:35:57.910 --> 05:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
and what your chart what what the cost
 
05:35:59.190 --> 05:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
is per
 
05:36:03.670 --> 05:36:03.680 align:start position:0%

representative
 
05:36:13.590 --> 05:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
our operating budget is about eight
 
05:36:15.590 --> 05:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars per year our
 
05:36:17.190 --> 05:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
dues vary anywhere between about a
 
05:36:18.948 --> 05:36:18.958 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for a small district in
 
05:36:23.110 --> 05:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
about 7 200 hours from manchester okay
 
05:36:24.708 --> 05:36:24.718 align:start position:0%
and since you raised the issue of
 
05:36:27.270 --> 05:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
germaine considering that it involves

members of the budget committee
 
05:36:32.470 --> 05:36:32.480 align:start position:0%

the records to make sure that the
 
05:37:06.628 --> 05:37:06.638 align:start position:0%
money's just not being you know that
 
05:37:08.310 --> 05:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
comes up disappears
 
05:37:11.030 --> 05:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
and i was just curious also if um
 
05:37:14.470 --> 05:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
hanover and goffstown are members
 
05:37:15.590 --> 05:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
05:37:16.548 --> 05:37:16.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:37:16.558 --> 05:37:18.470 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

05:37:18.470 --> 05:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:37:20.788 --> 05:37:20.798 align:start position:0%
most school boards have a professional
 
05:37:23.110 --> 05:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
audit done every year and if they don't
 
05:37:25.350 --> 05:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
they should an audit is different than
 
05:37:27.510 --> 05:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
ascertaining whether or not um you're
 
05:37:30.150 --> 05:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
getting a return on investment though i
 
05:37:31.990 --> 05:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
know that there are
 
05:37:33.910 --> 05:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
within this body within you know this
 
05:37:36.548 --> 05:37:36.558 align:start position:0%
building the um the cost of special
 
05:37:40.310 --> 05:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
education and the number of um
 
05:37:42.390 --> 05:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
students we have that are identified as
 
05:37:44.470 --> 05:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
special education students statewide has
 
05:37:46.708 --> 05:37:46.718 align:start position:0%
been a significant issue for a number of
 
05:37:48.868 --> 05:37:48.878 align:start position:0%
years i don't have any idea why our
 
05:37:50.708 --> 05:37:50.718 align:start position:0%
numbers are greater or higher in new
 
05:37:52.150 --> 05:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire than they are in other parts
 
05:37:54.150 --> 05:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
of the of the country i simply don't
 
05:37:55.110 --> 05:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
know that
 
05:37:57.670 --> 05:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
so in terms of an audit you know most
 
05:38:00.230 --> 05:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
school boards have an audit done
 
05:38:03.510 --> 05:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
done every single year um you know again
 
05:38:05.430 --> 05:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's different than ascertaining the
 
05:38:05.440 --> 05:38:06.628 align:start position:0%
that's different than ascertaining the
roi

05:38:06.628 --> 05:38:06.638 align:start position:0%
roi
 
05:38:09.430 --> 05:38:09.440 align:start position:0%

sided with one side you know are they in
 
05:38:34.548 --> 05:38:34.558 align:start position:0%

z-i-k
 
05:38:48.788 --> 05:38:48.798 align:start position:0%
my understanding is they do the vast
 
05:38:50.868 --> 05:38:50.878 align:start position:0%
majority of audits for school districts
 
05:38:52.070 --> 05:38:52.080 align:start position:0%

representative conley thank you and
 
05:39:00.868 --> 05:39:00.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
05:39:03.030 --> 05:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
as the bill is written
 
05:39:04.948 --> 05:39:04.958 align:start position:0%
is there any document that would not be
 
05:39:06.230 --> 05:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
05:39:07.910 --> 05:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
an elected school board member or
 
05:39:10.230 --> 05:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
elected budget committee member
 
05:39:13.510 --> 05:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh in any record in any district
 
05:39:14.948 --> 05:39:14.958 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question representative
 
05:39:17.110 --> 05:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
if i understand the question is there is
 
05:39:18.708 --> 05:39:18.718 align:start position:0%
there any document that would not be
 
05:39:21.350 --> 05:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
subject to disclosure if
 
05:39:23.990 --> 05:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
if i may ask for clarification
 
05:39:26.150 --> 05:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
is there any limit on documents that
 
05:39:27.750 --> 05:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
could be shared with the school board
 
05:39:29.510 --> 05:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
member budget committee member as
 
05:39:31.430 --> 05:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
contemplated under the bill yeah thank
 
05:39:33.510 --> 05:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
you very much as i mentioned if we're
 
05:39:34.868 --> 05:39:34.878 align:start position:0%
going to if we're going to interpret
 
05:39:37.350 --> 05:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
documents as meaning public records rsa
 
05:39:40.470 --> 05:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
91a colon 5 um under the right to know
 
05:39:42.070 --> 05:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
law lists the exemptions to public
 
05:39:44.070 --> 05:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
records saying these are there are
 
05:39:45.750 --> 05:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
public records your minutes your
 
05:39:47.990 --> 05:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
invoices contracts so on and so forth
 
05:39:49.830 --> 05:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
and then there's a very long list of
 
05:39:51.590 --> 05:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
documents that are not that are called
 
05:39:53.990 --> 05:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
that are exempt from public disclosure
 
05:39:57.190 --> 05:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
so you know it it's very broad-based but
 
05:39:58.230 --> 05:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
the the
 
05:39:59.190 --> 05:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
05:40:01.510 --> 05:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
the quick answer is you know it says
 
05:40:04.070 --> 05:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
something any any record or document
 
05:40:06.788 --> 05:40:06.798 align:start position:0%
that um whose disclosure would otherwise
 
05:40:08.788 --> 05:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
constitute an invasion of privacy i'm
 
05:40:10.788 --> 05:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
trying to pull up the the quick language
 
05:40:11.910 --> 05:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
right here if
 
05:40:13.190 --> 05:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
if you give me a
 
05:40:15.270 --> 05:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
if that'd be all right mr chair
 
05:40:15.280 --> 05:40:16.310 align:start position:0%
if that'd be all right mr chair
um

05:40:16.310 --> 05:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:23.750 --> 05:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:25.670 --> 05:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
and other files whose disclosure would
 
05:40:28.390 --> 05:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
constitute an invasion of privacy so
 
05:40:30.628 --> 05:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
that's pretty broad and and
 
05:40:32.390 --> 05:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
there are court cases that
 
05:40:34.628 --> 05:40:34.638 align:start position:0%
that have to interpret that because it's
 
05:40:36.390 --> 05:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's so broad-based but that's the
 
05:40:40.070 --> 05:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:41.830 --> 05:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you that that's not the language
 
05:40:44.470 --> 05:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
of the bill but um well and under the
 
05:40:46.788 --> 05:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
bill as the bill is written is there any
 
05:40:48.310 --> 05:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
part of the school that a school board
 
05:40:50.230 --> 05:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
member could not access the locker room
 
05:40:52.708 --> 05:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
facilities cheerleading practice vaccine
 
05:40:52.718 --> 05:40:53.990 align:start position:0%
facilities cheerleading practice vaccine
clinic

05:40:53.990 --> 05:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
clinic
 
05:40:56.470 --> 05:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
anything at all within a school building
 
05:40:59.030 --> 05:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
that this person could not access as the
 
05:41:01.430 --> 05:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
bill is written um
 
05:41:02.230 --> 05:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:41:02.240 --> 05:41:03.590 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

05:41:03.590 --> 05:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:41:05.830 --> 05:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
i i don't believe there would be any
 
05:41:09.750 --> 05:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:12.390 --> 05:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
05:41:13.750 --> 05:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you for
 
05:41:15.190 --> 05:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:41:17.670 --> 05:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
would you what did i say
 
05:41:21.350 --> 05:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:27.990 --> 05:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:30.868 --> 05:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
i juggle two committees guys
 
05:41:32.788 --> 05:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:41:34.390 --> 05:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
would you
 
05:41:36.390 --> 05:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
would you agree that one way
 
05:41:39.110 --> 05:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
to solve the problem of documents would
 
05:41:40.708 --> 05:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
be as an example we've talked a lot
 
05:41:42.070 --> 05:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
about ieps
 
05:41:44.948 --> 05:41:44.958 align:start position:0%
so if in a student's iep it says two
 
05:41:47.270 --> 05:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
hours of counseling a week
 
05:41:50.070 --> 05:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
and it's an outside counseling agency
 
05:41:53.270 --> 05:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
and you are billed for those services
 
05:41:55.750 --> 05:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
when you if you're the treasurer and
 
05:41:57.430 --> 05:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
you're signing off on the checks and the
 
05:42:00.150 --> 05:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
check is going to abc counseling
 
05:42:02.390 --> 05:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
that you are able to have a copy of the
 
05:42:04.390 --> 05:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
invoice you can
 
05:42:06.390 --> 05:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely cross off the student's name
 
05:42:09.110 --> 05:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
but you can see the service provider's
 
05:42:11.910 --> 05:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
name the amount of hours
 
05:42:15.430 --> 05:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
and then it is the job of the personnel
 
05:42:18.548 --> 05:42:18.558 align:start position:0%
to match up that invoice with the iep
 
05:42:21.350 --> 05:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
services on the services page
 
05:42:22.548 --> 05:42:22.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question
 
05:42:23.910 --> 05:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative i think i understand what
 
05:42:25.750 --> 05:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
you're getting at and you know
 
05:42:27.750 --> 05:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
nhsba generally takes the position that
 
05:42:28.948 --> 05:42:28.958 align:start position:0%
anything dealing with money is going to
 
05:42:30.628 --> 05:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
be public information or public record
 
05:42:32.548 --> 05:42:32.558 align:start position:0%
anyway whether or not it's an invoice or
 
05:42:34.628 --> 05:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
a bill certain things will be redacted
 
05:42:36.788 --> 05:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
the student's name you know johnny jones
 
05:42:38.470 --> 05:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
for the two hours of physical therapy
 
05:42:40.070 --> 05:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's going to be redacted but the
 
05:42:42.310 --> 05:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
invoice and the and the and the check
 
05:42:43.670 --> 05:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
that the school district writes to pay
 
05:42:45.670 --> 05:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
for that service is going to be public
 
05:42:47.510 --> 05:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
public information anyway anything
 
05:42:49.350 --> 05:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with money you know our default
 
05:42:50.708 --> 05:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
position is if it deals with money it's
 
05:42:55.830 --> 05:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:57.590 --> 05:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
if the chair may inquire with a question
 
05:42:59.750 --> 05:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question and
 
05:43:01.110 --> 05:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'll preface this by saying i'm not
 
05:43:02.628 --> 05:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
suggesting that a member of the budget
 
05:43:04.868 --> 05:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
committee is in a position to
 
05:43:06.868 --> 05:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
be evaluating whether an iep is
 
05:43:08.230 --> 05:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate for a particular student or
 
05:43:09.430 --> 05:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
not they weren't involved in that
 
05:43:11.750 --> 05:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
process what i'm concerned with
 
05:43:15.270 --> 05:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
is if an if a certain number is given to
 
05:43:17.430 --> 05:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
the budget committee or to the
 
05:43:19.270 --> 05:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
school board
 
05:43:21.750 --> 05:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
if they don't have access to that
 
05:43:24.150 --> 05:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
the information in the iep how are they
 
05:43:25.430 --> 05:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to make an informed decision
 
05:43:26.788 --> 05:43:26.798 align:start position:0%
whether to
 
05:43:28.628 --> 05:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
approve that figure or not
 
05:43:30.548 --> 05:43:30.558 align:start position:0%
it seems that i'm just my point is it
 
05:43:31.590 --> 05:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
seems like they're operating in the dark
 
05:43:32.628 --> 05:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
and i have no reason to think those
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
numbers are being misrepresented
 
05:43:35.990 --> 05:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the state it's just
 
05:43:37.670 --> 05:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
if one were to inquire
 
05:43:39.430 --> 05:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
about that number
 
05:43:40.788 --> 05:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
they don't really have much information
 
05:43:42.230 --> 05:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
to go off other than
 
05:43:44.948 --> 05:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
the number thanks for the question um mr
 
05:43:48.310 --> 05:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:50.310 --> 05:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:43:52.470 --> 05:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
the iep's are a couple different i'm
 
05:43:53.910 --> 05:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
trying to think of the right angle to go
 
05:43:55.590 --> 05:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
with with my answer here first of all
 
05:43:57.750 --> 05:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
special education is so highly regulated
 
05:43:59.750 --> 05:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
by the federal government that you know
 
05:44:02.310 --> 05:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
the state laws the state rules are a
 
05:44:03.990 --> 05:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
05:44:05.590 --> 05:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
broader if you will giving more rights
 
05:44:07.110 --> 05:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
to students
 
05:44:09.110 --> 05:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire than the federal law
 
05:44:10.868 --> 05:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
but in terms of
 
05:44:12.310 --> 05:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not you're going to pay for
 
05:44:12.320 --> 05:44:13.430 align:start position:0%
whether or not you're going to pay for
it

05:44:13.430 --> 05:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:44:15.190 --> 05:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
school boards have
 
05:44:17.590 --> 05:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
one option relative to special education
 
05:44:20.230 --> 05:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
costs pay for it it's as simple as that
 
05:44:21.990 --> 05:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
federal law dictates that these services
 
05:44:23.910 --> 05:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
be provided the only school board
 
05:44:25.430 --> 05:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility relative to special
 
05:44:28.070 --> 05:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
education is to is to fund it and put it
 
05:44:29.910 --> 05:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
in the budget and then pay for it and
 
05:44:29.920 --> 05:44:30.948 align:start position:0%
in the budget and then pay for it and
that's

05:44:30.948 --> 05:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:44:33.030 --> 05:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not trying to be blunt or
 
05:44:35.910 --> 05:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
or or flipping but that's the reality of
 
05:44:38.548 --> 05:44:38.558 align:start position:0%
what special education is about you pay
 
05:44:40.788 --> 05:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
you pay for the bill now can a school
 
05:44:43.270 --> 05:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
district can a school board and choir do
 
05:44:45.350 --> 05:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
um not a financial audit as we were
 
05:44:49.910 --> 05:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
talked about but an audit of of staffing
 
05:44:51.430 --> 05:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the superintendent
 
05:44:52.948 --> 05:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
do we have the right staff do we have
 
05:44:54.470 --> 05:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
the proper number of staff are they
 
05:44:56.390 --> 05:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
being allocated the right way is there a
 
05:44:58.390 --> 05:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
way to cut this staff and add this so
 
05:45:00.868 --> 05:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know we get better services
 
05:45:02.788 --> 05:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
and drive down some of this cost
 
05:45:04.628 --> 05:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's a conversation that
 
05:45:06.548 --> 05:45:06.558 align:start position:0%
the school board should have with its
 
05:45:08.470 --> 05:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
administrators if it feels that's that's
 
05:45:10.708 --> 05:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
prudent relative to student concerns or
 
05:45:13.590 --> 05:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
budgetary concerns but they're not going
 
05:45:16.390 --> 05:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
to get that from looking at the iep
 
05:45:17.670 --> 05:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
um it's not a school board's
 
05:45:19.830 --> 05:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility to ensure that johnny got
 
05:45:22.708 --> 05:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
his two hours of speech therapy
 
05:45:24.470 --> 05:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know there's no school board
 
05:45:27.110 --> 05:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
hearings relative to special education
 
05:45:28.390 --> 05:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's all run through the department of
 
05:45:30.310 --> 05:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
education there's a complaint process
 
05:45:32.390 --> 05:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
through the department of education in
 
05:45:34.310 --> 05:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
the school board's responsibility for
 
05:45:37.030 --> 05:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
special education is to staff it and and
 
05:45:38.390 --> 05:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
fund it
 
05:45:40.470 --> 05:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
and that's the law i'm not saying that
 
05:45:44.948 --> 05:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:47.190 --> 05:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and if i can ask a follow-up
 
05:45:49.030 --> 05:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
to clarify your testimony are you
 
05:45:52.070 --> 05:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the school board
 
05:45:53.750 --> 05:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
is not in shouldn't be in a position to
 
05:45:55.430 --> 05:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
really question the figure presented to
 
05:45:56.788 --> 05:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
itself it's just whether to approve it
 
05:45:57.750 --> 05:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
or not
 
05:45:57.760 --> 05:45:58.708 align:start position:0%
or not
that

05:45:58.708 --> 05:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:46:01.350 --> 05:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um mr chair
 
05:46:02.868 --> 05:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
no the board can certainly have those
 
05:46:04.548 --> 05:46:04.558 align:start position:0%
questions during budget time but if a
 
05:46:07.030 --> 05:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
child is found to be in need of services
 
05:46:09.670 --> 05:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
under special education law and the iep
 
05:46:12.868 --> 05:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
team through the iep process
 
05:46:15.350 --> 05:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
you know requires this level of services
 
05:46:18.470 --> 05:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
this number of aids this number of of
 
05:46:20.470 --> 05:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
out-of-district placements or services
 
05:46:22.310 --> 05:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
or whatever it may be
 
05:46:24.470 --> 05:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
the iep team
 
05:46:24.480 --> 05:46:25.590 align:start position:0%
the iep team
parent

05:46:25.590 --> 05:46:25.600 align:start position:0%

special ed teacher
 
05:46:31.030 --> 05:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe a special ed director
 
05:46:32.868 --> 05:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
maybe a physical therapist or a speech
 
05:46:35.190 --> 05:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
therapist that team
 
05:46:37.750 --> 05:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
six eight ten people are meeting and
 
05:46:39.110 --> 05:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
they determine
 
05:46:40.868 --> 05:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
what the services are that the child
 
05:46:40.878 --> 05:46:43.190 align:start position:0%
what the services are that the child
needs

05:46:43.190 --> 05:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
needs
 
05:46:45.830 --> 05:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
and then once that is ascertained when
 
05:46:47.430 --> 05:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
they determine what the what the
 
05:46:49.910 --> 05:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
services are that that that child needs
 
05:46:51.430 --> 05:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
the district has an obligation to pay
 
05:46:52.788 --> 05:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
for presuming that the parents in the
 
05:46:54.948 --> 05:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
district agree to
 
05:46:57.270 --> 05:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
those being the services that are needed
 
05:46:58.708 --> 05:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
the school board does not get involved
 
05:47:00.230 --> 05:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
in determining whether or not johnny
 
05:47:01.910 --> 05:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
needs one hour physical therapy or two
 
05:47:03.830 --> 05:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
hours of physical therapy
 
05:47:05.670 --> 05:47:05.680 align:start position:0%

06:01:39.110 --> 06:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:01:41.350 --> 06:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
this doesn't rise to a
 
06:01:43.430 --> 06:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment
 
06:01:44.868 --> 06:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
06:01:47.430 --> 06:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have other ones about
 
06:01:56.230 --> 06:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:58.310 --> 06:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
this is another cannabis bill
 
06:01:58.320 --> 06:02:00.548 align:start position:0%
this is another cannabis bill
yes

06:02:00.548 --> 06:02:00.558 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:02:04.070 --> 06:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:07.510 --> 06:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
in respect to the now we had a few ca
 
06:02:11.030 --> 06:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
cr's involving cannabis this one i think
 
06:02:12.548 --> 06:02:12.558 align:start position:0%
is the most detailed at least in the
 
06:02:14.470 --> 06:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
sense of if it were to be
 
06:02:16.470 --> 06:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
become a constitutional amendment it
 
06:02:17.430 --> 06:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:02:19.910 --> 06:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's clear what would what it would do
 
06:02:19.920 --> 06:02:21.270 align:start position:0%
it's clear what would what it would do
however

06:02:21.270 --> 06:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:02:22.390 --> 06:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
this is something that can be done
 
06:02:25.190 --> 06:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
through an act of legislation
 
06:02:26.948 --> 06:02:26.958 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't need to be done through a
 
06:02:26.958 --> 06:02:28.548 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't need to be done through a
cacr

06:02:28.548 --> 06:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
cacr
 
06:02:30.548 --> 06:02:30.558 align:start position:0%
the only difference is is whether we
 
06:02:30.558 --> 06:02:32.548 align:start position:0%
the only difference is is whether we
think

06:02:32.548 --> 06:02:32.558 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:02:35.910 --> 06:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
one would become law over the other
 
06:02:37.430 --> 06:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a different procedure
 
06:02:39.030 --> 06:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
process but
 
06:02:41.590 --> 06:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
i mean all adults have the right to
 
06:02:43.510 --> 06:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
possess use cultivate
 
06:02:45.750 --> 06:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis subject to regulations or taxes
 
06:02:47.590 --> 06:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
on commercial activity
 
06:02:50.150 --> 06:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
as the general court may impose so i
 
06:02:54.230 --> 06:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:56.070 --> 06:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
that can simply be
 
06:02:58.470 --> 06:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
a legislative that can be an rsa as a
 
06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
policy not a necessarily a
 
06:03:02.150 --> 06:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment that's just my
 
06:03:05.990 --> 06:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:08.548 --> 06:03:08.558 align:start position:0%
the policy issue aside
 
06:03:11.190 --> 06:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair uh
 
06:03:13.510 --> 06:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i know i think i'd be happy to you
 
06:03:15.510 --> 06:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
know legalize cannabis and i think but i
 
06:03:17.670 --> 06:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
think that all the com the arguments
 
06:03:19.270 --> 06:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
that were heard that we've already had
 
06:03:21.750 --> 06:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
on this i think we
 
06:03:23.750 --> 06:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
we can just put it like you know we can
 
06:03:25.990 --> 06:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
move forward and just take a quick quick
 
06:03:28.070 --> 06:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
vote on this but on my end i'm probably
 
06:03:29.590 --> 06:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
going to support but
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:35.030 --> 06:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
i'll just throw this out there if things
 
06:03:37.190 --> 06:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
don't go the way i i hope
 
06:03:39.190 --> 06:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
with another bill if someone were to
 
06:03:41.990 --> 06:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
refile a cacr next term
 
06:03:43.750 --> 06:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
this is the one i like the best out of
 
06:03:45.350 --> 06:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
all three that's just my opinion that
 
06:03:46.830 --> 06:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter
 
06:03:52.788 --> 06:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:54.470 --> 06:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
after having
 
06:03:54.480 --> 06:03:55.350 align:start position:0%
after having
my

06:03:55.350 --> 06:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:03:57.190 --> 06:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
friend in front of me turn around and
 
06:03:59.750 --> 06:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
ask me why
 
06:04:01.270 --> 06:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
i thought about it
 
06:04:05.750 --> 06:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:08.310 --> 06:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
and he's correct that
 
06:04:11.590 --> 06:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
the first cacr was itled and the second
 
06:04:15.430 --> 06:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:16.470 --> 06:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
and then
 
06:04:17.830 --> 06:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
my good friend
 
06:04:20.788 --> 06:04:20.798 align:start position:0%
representative true keeps looking at me
 
06:04:20.798 --> 06:04:21.750 align:start position:0%
representative true keeps looking at me
and

06:04:21.750 --> 06:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:04:24.310 --> 06:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
i think i'm gonna oppose the itl this
 
06:04:26.548 --> 06:04:26.558 align:start position:0%
time because you know we we should let
 
06:04:29.270 --> 06:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
the voters at least have one of the
 
06:04:32.390 --> 06:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
bills and as you point out that this is
 
06:04:35.270 --> 06:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
the best of the group of them
 
06:04:37.430 --> 06:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
so i guess i'm gonna
 
06:04:39.350 --> 06:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
probably go with my two colleagues that
 
06:04:44.948 --> 06:04:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:58.310 --> 06:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:00.708 --> 06:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
06:05:03.030 --> 06:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
06:05:05.750 --> 06:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
um so it's been said that we don't need
 
06:05:06.868 --> 06:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
to have a
 
06:05:08.310 --> 06:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment we could just
 
06:05:11.030 --> 06:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
pass a law for this
 
06:05:11.040 --> 06:05:12.390 align:start position:0%
pass a law for this
um

06:05:12.390 --> 06:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:14.310 --> 06:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
but we haven't
 
06:05:15.510 --> 06:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we're going to pass
 
06:05:18.708 --> 06:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:21.670 --> 06:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
so this is the opportunity
 
06:05:25.110 --> 06:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
to let those anecdotal voters
 
06:05:27.750 --> 06:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
who say that they are in favor of
 
06:05:27.760 --> 06:05:29.350 align:start position:0%
who say that they are in favor of
legalization

06:05:29.350 --> 06:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
legalization
 
06:05:31.190 --> 06:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
to have their voice
 
06:05:32.708 --> 06:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
because they're not getting a voice
 
06:05:34.628 --> 06:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
through the representatives
 
06:05:35.990 --> 06:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
this year
 
06:05:36.000 --> 06:05:37.110 align:start position:0%
this year
because

06:05:37.110 --> 06:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:05:38.868 --> 06:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
legalization is not going through the
 
06:05:41.670 --> 06:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
house it's not going through the senate
 
06:05:44.310 --> 06:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
and it's not getting past the governor
 
06:05:47.270 --> 06:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason
 
06:05:49.350 --> 06:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
the important thing is
 
06:05:51.030 --> 06:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
we're here as representatives of the
 
06:05:51.040 --> 06:05:52.070 align:start position:0%
we're here as representatives of the
people

06:05:52.070 --> 06:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:05:54.948 --> 06:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
surveys say the people would like it to
 
06:05:56.868 --> 06:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
be legalized
 
06:05:59.190 --> 06:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
and this is the bill that can do it
 
06:06:03.030 --> 06:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
so i will not support the ito
 
06:06:08.548 --> 06:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:09.990 --> 06:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised at this time
 
06:06:11.670 --> 06:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
we'll now move the question if you're in

06:09:13.430 --> 06:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:16.310 --> 06:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
so we're passing around amendments to
 
06:09:18.548 --> 06:09:18.558 align:start position:0%
one is an amendment for hp 1400 which
 
06:09:20.230 --> 06:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to do next we're also just
 
06:09:21.510 --> 06:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
for the sake of
 
06:09:23.110 --> 06:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
expediting the process we're passing out
 
06:09:25.830 --> 06:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
an amendment for hb 13
 
06:09:31.990 --> 06:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:33.430 --> 06:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
don't be surprised if that one comes up
 
06:09:33.440 --> 06:09:34.788 align:start position:0%
don't be surprised if that one comes up
next

06:09:34.788 --> 06:09:34.798 align:start position:0%
next
 
06:09:42.548 --> 06:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:42.558 --> 06:11:54.310 align:start position:0%
 
what's

06:11:54.310 --> 06:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:56.070 --> 06:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
at this time we will now open the
 
06:12:09.830 --> 06:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:11.270 --> 06:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognized
 
06:12:14.708 --> 06:12:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:14.718 --> 06:12:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:12:15.830 --> 06:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:17.270 --> 06:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to make a motion of an
 
06:12:25.590 --> 06:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:27.270 --> 06:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
that has been seconded by representative
 
06:12:27.280 --> 06:12:29.030 align:start position:0%
that has been seconded by representative
marston

06:12:29.030 --> 06:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
marston
 
06:12:30.708 --> 06:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
representative roy you wish to speak to
 
06:12:30.718 --> 06:12:31.590 align:start position:0%
representative roy you wish to speak to
your

06:12:31.590 --> 06:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
your
 
06:12:33.510 --> 06:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
motion of innings being to legislate i
 
06:12:35.350 --> 06:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
do um
 
06:12:37.350 --> 06:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
um while i'm sure all of us including
 
06:12:38.788 --> 06:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
myself are getting a little tired of
 
06:12:40.390 --> 06:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
talking about marijuana
 
06:12:40.400 --> 06:12:42.070 align:start position:0%
talking about marijuana
um

06:12:42.070 --> 06:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:44.868 --> 06:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
this this proposed statute
 
06:12:45.990 --> 06:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
is um
 
06:12:47.110 --> 06:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
looking for a problem that's already
 
06:12:48.230 --> 06:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
been solved
 
06:12:50.868 --> 06:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
the supreme court has ruled that
 
06:12:51.990 --> 06:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
06:12:54.070 --> 06:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
probable cause the center of marijuana
 
06:12:56.948 --> 06:12:56.958 align:start position:0%
is not probable cause
 
06:12:58.628 --> 06:12:58.638 align:start position:0%
possession of marijuana is not a crime
 
06:13:01.270 --> 06:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
so the scent of marijuana
 
06:13:03.830 --> 06:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
can't be probable cause
 
06:13:05.190 --> 06:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
for a search
 
06:13:07.590 --> 06:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
because it's not evidence of a crime so
 
06:13:09.910 --> 06:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
i don't see the need to codify this and
 
06:13:12.628 --> 06:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
clutter up our criminal statutes
 
06:13:14.868 --> 06:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
with a a bill that's already it's
 
06:13:17.830 --> 06:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
already law it's it's it's redundant
 
06:13:20.230 --> 06:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
based on decisions of the court
 
06:13:23.190 --> 06:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
um so it really it's just it would be
 
06:13:24.548 --> 06:13:24.558 align:start position:0%
putting something in statute just for
 
06:13:26.788 --> 06:13:26.798 align:start position:0%
the sake of putting something in statute
 
06:13:27.990 --> 06:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
06:13:30.548 --> 06:13:30.558 align:start position:0%
and that's why i would support an itl of
 
06:13:30.558 --> 06:13:33.030 align:start position:0%
and that's why i would support an itl of
this

06:13:33.030 --> 06:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:37.830 --> 06:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:39.830 --> 06:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
as was discussed in
 
06:13:45.030 --> 06:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:46.948 --> 06:13:46.958 align:start position:0%
a supreme court decision is not the same
 
06:13:49.990 --> 06:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
thing as law
 
06:13:51.590 --> 06:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
each individual police department has to
 
06:13:53.510 --> 06:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
be aware of the decision
 
06:13:55.510 --> 06:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
06:13:57.190 --> 06:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
follow it
 
06:13:59.590 --> 06:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
and just as a point of clarification i
 
06:14:01.910 --> 06:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
believe representative roy said that
 
06:14:03.590 --> 06:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
possession of marijuana is not a crime
 
06:14:05.270 --> 06:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
it is in some cases depending on the
 
06:14:05.280 --> 06:14:07.270 align:start position:0%
it is in some cases depending on the
quantity

06:14:07.270 --> 06:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
quantity
 
06:14:09.590 --> 06:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
and that is the issue at hand
 
06:14:10.948 --> 06:14:10.958 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:14:12.230 --> 06:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
an odor
 
06:14:14.310 --> 06:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
may or may not be evidence
 
06:14:16.948 --> 06:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
of a crime and that's the problem that's
 
06:14:20.310 --> 06:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
created in using an odor as
 
06:14:22.788 --> 06:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
probable cause
 
06:14:24.548 --> 06:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
if there were
 
06:14:24.558 --> 06:14:26.548 align:start position:0%
if there were
something

06:14:26.548 --> 06:14:26.558 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:14:28.948 --> 06:14:28.958 align:start position:0%
that would make a person easily or a
 
06:14:32.070 --> 06:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle or space easily smell like
 
06:14:34.150 --> 06:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
alcohol and let's say
 
06:14:35.510 --> 06:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
it involves a vehicle that's being
 
06:14:38.310 --> 06:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
driven there would be an issue of
 
06:14:40.150 --> 06:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
do we smell alcohol because someone's
 
06:14:41.990 --> 06:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
drunk or do we smell alcohol for a
 
06:14:44.150 --> 06:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
different reason
 
06:14:46.390 --> 06:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
and it is the case that
 
06:14:46.400 --> 06:14:47.750 align:start position:0%
and it is the case that
uh

06:14:47.750 --> 06:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:14:51.270 --> 06:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of natural things like skunks
 
06:14:52.788 --> 06:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
and different types of perfumes can
 
06:14:54.390 --> 06:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
smell like
 
06:14:54.400 --> 06:14:56.310 align:start position:0%
smell like
marijuana

06:14:56.310 --> 06:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
06:14:57.670 --> 06:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
i included
 
06:14:59.750 --> 06:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
as a handout the
 
06:15:01.510 --> 06:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
06:15:04.150 --> 06:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
decision that's being referenced
 
06:15:05.910 --> 06:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
it is
 
06:15:10.230 --> 06:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
necessary for the legislature to codify
 
06:15:12.470 --> 06:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
things like this if we agree with them
 
06:15:15.110 --> 06:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
or to codify in the opposite if we feel
 
06:15:18.070 --> 06:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
that the supreme court arrived at
 
06:15:21.110 --> 06:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
a conclusion that we don't support
 
06:15:23.830 --> 06:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
we don't just let the supreme court make
 
06:15:23.840 --> 06:15:25.030 align:start position:0%
we don't just let the supreme court make
law

06:15:25.030 --> 06:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
law
 
06:15:27.510 --> 06:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
we have the right to
 
06:15:29.910 --> 06:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
undermine their choices if we like as
 
06:15:32.070 --> 06:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature so let's say we didn't
 
06:15:33.350 --> 06:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
agree with this decision that would
 
06:15:36.230 --> 06:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
require legislation so if we agree with
 
06:15:38.788 --> 06:15:38.798 align:start position:0%
it it also requires legislation
 
06:15:41.110 --> 06:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
we've had we've ridden
 
06:15:43.270 --> 06:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
and passed laws in this
 
06:15:46.230 --> 06:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
body that were
 
06:15:48.390 --> 06:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
deemed unconstitutional and they needed
 
06:15:51.030 --> 06:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
to be repealed by this body after the
 
06:15:51.040 --> 06:15:52.310 align:start position:0%
to be repealed by this body after the
fact

06:15:52.310 --> 06:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
fact
 
06:15:54.310 --> 06:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
so it's an opinion but it's just an
 
06:15:56.310 --> 06:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
opinion and we do need the law it's not
 
06:15:56.320 --> 06:15:57.990 align:start position:0%
opinion and we do need the law it's not
clutter

06:15:57.990 --> 06:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
clutter
 
06:15:59.510 --> 06:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's the supreme court decision that
 
06:16:01.270 --> 06:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
really is clutter
 
06:16:02.948 --> 06:16:02.958 align:start position:0%
because in the sense that clutter is
 
06:16:04.628 --> 06:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
confusing and messy
 
06:16:06.868 --> 06:16:06.878 align:start position:0%
if there's police departments or
 
06:16:08.628 --> 06:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
individual officers who aren't aware of
 
06:16:10.548 --> 06:16:10.558 align:start position:0%
this decision
 
06:16:10.558 --> 06:16:12.788 align:start position:0%
this decision
then

06:16:12.788 --> 06:16:12.798 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:16:14.628 --> 06:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
we're going to have different outcomes
 
06:16:16.548 --> 06:16:16.558 align:start position:0%
that depend entirely upon the knowledge
 
06:16:19.190 --> 06:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
of the persons involved and not on what
 
06:16:21.190 --> 06:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
the law is
 
06:16:22.868 --> 06:16:22.878 align:start position:0%
and i just want to mention
 
06:16:24.948 --> 06:16:24.958 align:start position:0%
as is obvious to everyone
 
06:16:26.628 --> 06:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment that deals with
 
06:16:29.750 --> 06:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
the concerns about the um
 
06:16:31.030 --> 06:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
language that were brought up in the
 
06:16:31.040 --> 06:16:34.150 align:start position:0%
language that were brought up in the
hearing

06:16:34.150 --> 06:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:35.270 --> 06:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative you may state your point
 
06:16:40.948 --> 06:16:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:42.310 --> 06:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
in respect to the point of order the
 
06:16:43.910 --> 06:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
question that's before the committee is
 
06:16:46.868 --> 06:16:46.878 align:start position:0%
is not the amendment it is
 
06:16:48.230 --> 06:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
inexpensive i wasn't discussing the
 
06:16:51.270 --> 06:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
amendment i was saying that it exists
 
06:16:52.708 --> 06:16:52.718 align:start position:0%
let me
 
06:16:54.708 --> 06:16:54.718 align:start position:0%
i could just finish
 
06:16:54.718 --> 06:16:55.510 align:start position:0%
i could just finish
uh

06:16:55.510 --> 06:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:16:57.430 --> 06:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
so try it i have every right to say that
 
06:16:59.030 --> 06:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
it exists
 
06:17:00.948 --> 06:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
i i do have every right to say that it
 
06:17:03.830 --> 06:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
exists daryl the member will suspend i
 
06:17:05.270 --> 06:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
understand how the people the member
 
06:17:06.390 --> 06:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
will suspend
 
06:17:08.230 --> 06:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
and it's so inappropriate for you to cut
 
06:17:10.628 --> 06:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
people off out of order this is supposed
 
06:17:13.030 --> 06:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
to be a deliberative body order
 
06:17:15.590 --> 06:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
rational conversation
 
06:17:17.430 --> 06:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
if you're let me just i have to rule on
 
06:17:18.788 --> 06:17:18.798 align:start position:0%
the point of order now i understand you
 
06:17:21.030 --> 06:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to wait for that ruling and
 
06:17:22.628 --> 06:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
perhaps that ruling may be even in
 
06:17:24.628 --> 06:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
favorable to what you're saying
 
06:17:26.150 --> 06:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
but you won't actually let the chair
 
06:17:28.470 --> 06:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
finish and it make a said vote
 
06:17:29.990 --> 06:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
you're not a judge you don't rule on
 
06:17:31.430 --> 06:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
points of order this is you're a
 
06:17:31.440 --> 06:17:39.750 align:start position:0%
points of order this is you're a
legislator

06:17:39.750 --> 06:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:41.670 --> 06:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
your time to speak but just so you know
 
06:17:42.708 --> 06:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
you don't rule on anything because
 
06:17:43.990 --> 06:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
you're not a judge i just want to pass
 
06:17:45.110 --> 06:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
out would you like to challenge the
 
06:17:46.390 --> 06:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
ruling the chair you're free to no i'm
 
06:17:47.750 --> 06:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
just letting you know that your language
 
06:17:49.510 --> 06:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
isn't the member will suspend ask me a
 
06:17:51.350 --> 06:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
question you are free to challenge the
 
06:17:52.708 --> 06:17:52.718 align:start position:0%
ruling of the chair
 
06:17:54.310 --> 06:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
if you would allow the chair to make
 
06:17:56.230 --> 06:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
said ruling which you may or may not
 
06:17:57.750 --> 06:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
even agree with
 
06:17:59.270 --> 06:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
so if you want to talk stop asking me
 
06:17:59.280 --> 06:18:00.470 align:start position:0%
so if you want to talk stop asking me
questions

06:18:00.470 --> 06:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:18:00.480 --> 06:18:01.270 align:start position:0%
questions
so

06:18:01.270 --> 06:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:18:02.548 --> 06:18:02.558 align:start position:0%
i'm going to rule the member out of
 
06:18:02.558 --> 06:18:03.910 align:start position:0%
i'm going to rule the member out of
order

06:18:03.910 --> 06:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
order
 
06:18:05.190 --> 06:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
because you're continuing to speak
 
06:18:07.270 --> 06:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
without being recognized to speak
 
06:18:07.280 --> 06:18:08.310 align:start position:0%
without being recognized to speak
and

06:18:08.310 --> 06:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:18:10.868 --> 06:18:10.878 align:start position:0%
i'm asking that any testimony or excuse
 
06:18:12.470 --> 06:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
me any comments be limited to the
 
06:18:13.910 --> 06:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
underlying bill because the question
 
06:18:15.590 --> 06:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
before the committee
 
06:18:17.990 --> 06:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
is in expedition to legislate
 
06:18:19.110 --> 06:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
so i would i'm going to allow you to
 
06:18:21.030 --> 06:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
continue to speak but please try to
 
06:18:23.350 --> 06:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
limit your comments to the underlying
 
06:18:26.310 --> 06:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
bill not the amendment all i had to say
 
06:18:27.910 --> 06:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
the end of my testimony
 
06:18:29.430 --> 06:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
not testimony but my comments on the
 
06:18:30.470 --> 06:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
bill was
 
06:18:31.990 --> 06:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment that was the end of
 
06:18:33.590 --> 06:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
my sentence but instead we've had this
 
06:18:35.190 --> 06:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
protracted routine
 
06:18:36.708 --> 06:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
because there's some kind of gotcha
 
06:18:37.990 --> 06:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
attitude in this committee that doesn't
 
06:18:39.350 --> 06:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
need to exist
 
06:18:41.430 --> 06:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
that was literally all i had to say the
 
06:18:43.670 --> 06:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
member will suspend please honest you're
 
06:18:45.750 --> 06:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
not permitted to assign motives to other
 
06:18:47.510 --> 06:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
members i'm not assigning motive to
 
06:18:58.310 --> 06:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:59.830 --> 06:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
i'm ruling you out of order and you're
 
06:19:01.510 --> 06:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
not recognized to speak if you continue
 
06:19:02.868 --> 06:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
06:19:04.868 --> 06:19:04.878 align:start position:0%
you're not speaking well recognized so
 
06:19:06.070 --> 06:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
you're just speaking out of order
 
06:19:07.830 --> 06:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
disrupting the committee
 
06:19:10.948 --> 06:19:10.958 align:start position:0%
do any other members wish to speak
 
06:19:12.788 --> 06:19:12.798 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
06:19:15.110 --> 06:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
06:19:17.510 --> 06:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
back to the the matter at hand
 
06:19:19.910 --> 06:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
with regard to supreme court decisions
 
06:19:21.910 --> 06:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
being law that they actually they
 
06:19:24.948 --> 06:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
actually are um unfortunately i agree
 
06:19:26.788 --> 06:19:26.798 align:start position:0%
that we um
 
06:19:29.350 --> 06:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
but we we have a long history arizona
 
06:19:32.070 --> 06:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
versus um versus the miranda
 
06:19:34.708 --> 06:19:34.718 align:start position:0%
terry v ohio all these things are are
 
06:19:37.510 --> 06:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
not codified yet they are followed by
 
06:19:38.788 --> 06:19:38.798 align:start position:0%
the police
 
06:19:40.708 --> 06:19:40.718 align:start position:0%
miranda warnings are required when
 
06:19:42.390 --> 06:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
someone's in consolidated interrogation
 
06:19:44.310 --> 06:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony about that
 
06:19:46.708 --> 06:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
numerous times in this committee so the
 
06:19:48.548 --> 06:19:48.558 align:start position:0%
police departments will be well aware of
 
06:19:49.990 --> 06:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
the court decision
 
06:19:51.110 --> 06:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think there are any police
 
06:19:52.070 --> 06:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
departments in the state of new
 
06:19:54.150 --> 06:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire that are not aware of the
 
06:19:55.830 --> 06:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
decision from two years ago that said
 
06:19:57.510 --> 06:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
they cannot search cars based on the
 
06:20:00.230 --> 06:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
smell of marijuana anymore
 
06:20:02.468 --> 06:20:02.478 align:start position:0%
so again i go back i don't feel that
 
06:20:04.708 --> 06:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
this is necessary based on the fact that
 
06:20:06.390 --> 06:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's already
 
06:20:08.310 --> 06:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
the law of the land vis-a-vis the
 
06:20:10.628 --> 06:20:10.638 align:start position:0%
decision of the supreme court of the
 
06:20:14.310 --> 06:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire thank you
 
06:20:18.310 --> 06:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:20.548 --> 06:20:20.558 align:start position:0%
i talked with some police and
 
06:20:22.948 --> 06:20:22.958 align:start position:0%
their their only point was
 
06:20:25.270 --> 06:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
you can't use marijuana
 
06:20:27.430 --> 06:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
and i think that's what this one said
 
06:20:29.350 --> 06:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
as the only reason for getting a search
 
06:20:29.360 --> 06:20:30.230 align:start position:0%
as the only reason for getting a search
warrant

06:20:30.230 --> 06:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
06:20:32.150 --> 06:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
it has to be used
 
06:20:33.430 --> 06:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
as a
 
06:20:35.350 --> 06:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
contributing factor or whatever you want
 
06:20:37.910 --> 06:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
to call it you know there's something
 
06:20:40.628 --> 06:20:40.638 align:start position:0%
else you see in the car or something
 
06:20:40.638 --> 06:20:41.430 align:start position:0%
else you see in the car or something
so

06:20:41.430 --> 06:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:20:43.030 --> 06:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
and that's the only thing my problem
 
06:20:45.350 --> 06:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
with this bill is that it makes it an
 
06:20:46.948 --> 06:20:46.958 align:start position:0%
only reason
 
06:20:48.708 --> 06:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
and that isn't
 
06:20:59.270 --> 06:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:01.750 --> 06:21:01.760 align:start position:0%

i mean it was a unanimous vote right
 
06:26:37.110 --> 06:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:39.270 --> 06:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative welch you wish to speak

06:26:43.840 --> 06:26:48.310 align:start position:0%
 
no

06:26:48.310 --> 06:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:48.320 --> 06:26:49.270 align:start position:0%
 
well

06:26:49.270 --> 06:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:26:55.990 --> 06:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:57.910 --> 06:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
i will say i summed up the intent of the
 
06:26:58.868 --> 06:26:58.878 align:start position:0%
bill with
 
06:27:01.830 --> 06:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
with my my testimony again it's just to
 
06:27:04.468 --> 06:27:04.478 align:start position:0%
clarify it's only applying to third and
 
06:27:05.910 --> 06:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
fourth offenses
 
06:27:07.510 --> 06:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
and the idea is
 
06:27:09.030 --> 06:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
in order to convict someone of a
 
06:27:10.310 --> 06:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
subsequent defense they have to actually
 
06:27:11.590 --> 06:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
be convicted of the first offense so if
 
06:27:14.390 --> 06:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
someone were to get arrested three times
 
06:27:16.310 --> 06:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
for drunk driving in a two-month time
 
06:27:16.320 --> 06:27:17.350 align:start position:0%
for drunk driving in a two-month time
period

06:27:17.350 --> 06:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
period
 
06:27:18.708 --> 06:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
you're unlikely to have a conviction on
 
06:27:20.310 --> 06:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
those so they're gonna be charged with
 
06:27:24.310 --> 06:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:26.468 --> 06:27:26.478 align:start position:0%
i think extending it for the look back
 
06:27:28.230 --> 06:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
period for third and fourth offenses to
 
06:27:29.350 --> 06:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
06:27:31.110 --> 06:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
we're really focusing on habitual
 
06:27:33.750 --> 06:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
offenders at this point so
 
06:27:36.150 --> 06:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
i think it's a modest way to address
 
06:27:37.430 --> 06:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
what i would say
 
06:27:40.150 --> 06:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
repeat offenses that put public safety
 
06:27:41.190 --> 06:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
in danger
 
06:27:43.430 --> 06:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
so i hope you all join me in supporting
 
06:27:43.440 --> 06:27:45.510 align:start position:0%
so i hope you all join me in supporting

06:31:47.750 --> 06:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:50.310 --> 06:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
at this time uh the chair recognized uh
 
06:31:52.868 --> 06:31:52.878 align:start position:0%
representative roy to make a motion
 
06:31:56.150 --> 06:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
i would like to move hp 1085 as ought to
 
06:31:56.160 --> 06:31:58.548 align:start position:0%
i would like to move hp 1085 as ought to
pass

06:31:58.548 --> 06:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
pass
 
06:32:11.830 --> 06:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:13.110 --> 06:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
i apologize
 
06:32:14.708 --> 06:32:14.718 align:start position:0%
uh represent representative muse you're
 
06:32:14.718 --> 06:32:16.708 align:start position:0%
uh represent representative muse you're
recognized

06:32:16.708 --> 06:32:16.718 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
06:32:18.390 --> 06:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
sorry you've seconded the most about the
 
06:32:18.400 --> 06:32:23.190 align:start position:0%
sorry you've seconded the most about the
past

06:32:23.190 --> 06:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:25.190 --> 06:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to the motion
 
06:32:27.110 --> 06:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
i would defer to the chair to explain to
 
06:32:29.270 --> 06:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
the committee his thoughts on that
 
06:32:30.868 --> 06:32:30.878 align:start position:0%
representative since you seconded would
 
06:32:31.910 --> 06:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
you wish to
 
06:32:33.510 --> 06:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
address it
 
06:32:34.708 --> 06:32:34.718 align:start position:0%
you may reserve
 
06:32:36.150 --> 06:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
for later on the discussion if you'd
 
06:32:36.160 --> 06:32:39.510 align:start position:0%
for later on the discussion if you'd
like

06:32:39.510 --> 06:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:42.310 --> 06:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
i do think that we heard testimony that
 
06:32:44.468 --> 06:32:44.478 align:start position:0%
that this particular bill does address a
 
06:32:46.390 --> 06:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
significant loophole
 
06:32:48.468 --> 06:32:48.478 align:start position:0%
in our law now i think the last thing
 
06:32:51.430 --> 06:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
that any of us want is
 
06:32:53.750 --> 06:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
to provide loopholes for drunk drivers
 
06:32:56.948 --> 06:32:56.958 align:start position:0%
to get back on the road so
 
06:32:59.030 --> 06:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would go a long way towards uh
 
06:33:01.190 --> 06:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
towards closing that loophole and
 
06:33:04.390 --> 06:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:06.070 --> 06:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative music
 
06:33:07.910 --> 06:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
the term loophole is what came to my
 
06:33:13.110 --> 06:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:16.070 --> 06:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
i heard a lot of discussion about
 
06:33:17.990 --> 06:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know any vehicles register that
 
06:33:20.310 --> 06:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
person whether that's the economic side
 
06:33:21.350 --> 06:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
of that
 
06:33:24.548 --> 06:33:24.558 align:start position:0%
i certainly appreciate that but the goal
 
06:33:28.390 --> 06:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
of the interlocking device
 
06:33:30.628 --> 06:33:30.638 align:start position:0%
is to prevent the person from operating
 
06:33:33.030 --> 06:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
a motor vehicle without
 
06:33:34.948 --> 06:33:34.958 align:start position:0%
blowing into the machine
 
06:33:36.788 --> 06:33:36.798 align:start position:0%
at all cost if the person were to
 
06:33:38.708 --> 06:33:38.718 align:start position:0%
violate this law that in and of itself
 
06:33:40.468 --> 06:33:40.478 align:start position:0%
the system has already failed even if
 
06:33:41.750 --> 06:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
that person
 
06:33:44.628 --> 06:33:44.638 align:start position:0%
wasn't even intoxicated or impaired
 
06:33:44.638 --> 06:33:45.430 align:start position:0%
wasn't even intoxicated or impaired
so

06:33:45.430 --> 06:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:33:47.590 --> 06:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's unreasonable to make
 
06:33:48.948 --> 06:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
a presumption that if a vehicle is
 
06:33:50.468 --> 06:33:50.478 align:start position:0%
registered in that person's name that
 
06:33:52.708 --> 06:33:52.718 align:start position:0%
they tend to drive that vehicle
 
06:33:53.590 --> 06:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
and then
 
06:33:55.910 --> 06:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
having to demonstrate on a regular basis
 
06:33:57.270 --> 06:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if there's
 
06:33:58.548 --> 06:33:58.558 align:start position:0%
courts have interpreted that but if
 
06:34:00.548 --> 06:34:00.558 align:start position:0%
they're offering a motor vehicle
 
06:34:03.190 --> 06:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
and they have not blown into the
 
06:34:05.350 --> 06:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
ignition interlock device
 
06:34:07.110 --> 06:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
they're basically
 
06:34:08.708 --> 06:34:08.718 align:start position:0%
walking around the system and taking
 
06:34:10.548 --> 06:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
advantage of and exploiting it
 
06:34:12.868 --> 06:34:12.878 align:start position:0%
when they've either a have been arrested
 
06:34:14.548 --> 06:34:14.558 align:start position:0%
several arrested and convicted several
 
06:34:16.310 --> 06:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
times or been involved in aggravated
 
06:34:16.320 --> 06:34:17.670 align:start position:0%
times or been involved in aggravated
offense

06:34:17.670 --> 06:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
offense
 
06:34:17.680 --> 06:34:19.030 align:start position:0%
offense
so

06:34:19.030 --> 06:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:34:20.468 --> 06:34:20.478 align:start position:0%
i think this really
 
06:34:22.948 --> 06:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
captures the intent of what the bill
 
06:34:24.628 --> 06:34:24.638 align:start position:0%
the law should have been from the start
 
06:34:27.670 --> 06:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
so i would i would support not to pass
 
06:34:29.430 --> 06:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative boardney
 
06:34:30.868 --> 06:34:30.878 align:start position:0%
thank you sure
 
06:34:33.670 --> 06:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to oppose the ultra pass
 
06:34:37.430 --> 06:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
i really don't like this bill because it
 
06:34:41.110 --> 06:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
requires all vehicles that basically are
 
06:34:42.628 --> 06:34:42.638 align:start position:0%
registered by
 
06:34:45.510 --> 06:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
the individual to have interlock device
 
06:34:47.350 --> 06:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
on them not only does that
 
06:34:47.360 --> 06:34:48.868 align:start position:0%
on them not only does that
punish

06:34:48.868 --> 06:34:48.878 align:start position:0%
punish
 
06:34:50.230 --> 06:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
06:34:53.590 --> 06:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
person but also furnishes anybody that's
 
06:34:55.910 --> 06:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
driving those vehicles in within the
 
06:34:55.920 --> 06:34:57.030 align:start position:0%
driving those vehicles in within the
family

06:34:57.030 --> 06:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
family
 
06:34:57.040 --> 06:34:58.548 align:start position:0%
family
um

06:34:58.548 --> 06:34:58.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:02.070 --> 06:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
i think that the original language
 
06:35:05.190 --> 06:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
takes care of what we wanted to do we
 
06:35:09.670 --> 06:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:13.430 --> 06:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
well this person is under this uh
 
06:35:16.708 --> 06:35:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:18.468 --> 06:35:18.478 align:start position:0%
anytime he drives
 
06:35:18.478 --> 06:35:19.990 align:start position:0%
anytime he drives
rv

06:35:19.990 --> 06:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
rv
 
06:35:21.910 --> 06:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
they have to drive a vehicle with an
 
06:35:23.910 --> 06:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
interlock device
 
06:35:26.708 --> 06:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
and that is not clearly stated in this
 
06:35:30.390 --> 06:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
this means that any vehicle he uses or
 
06:35:32.468 --> 06:35:32.478 align:start position:0%
has registered to his
 
06:35:32.478 --> 06:35:33.350 align:start position:0%
has registered to his
name

06:35:33.350 --> 06:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
name
 
06:35:35.750 --> 06:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
has to have an interlock device
 
06:35:35.760 --> 06:35:36.708 align:start position:0%
has to have an interlock device
and

06:35:36.708 --> 06:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:35:36.718 --> 06:35:37.670 align:start position:0%
and
now

06:35:37.670 --> 06:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:35:40.948 --> 06:35:40.958 align:start position:0%
we are not necessarily agreed that the
 
06:35:42.788 --> 06:35:42.798 align:start position:0%
vehicles in this case are just
 
06:35:46.150 --> 06:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
exclusively automobiles it could be also
 
06:35:46.160 --> 06:35:48.390 align:start position:0%
exclusively automobiles it could be also
as

06:35:48.390 --> 06:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
as
 
06:35:50.150 --> 06:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
06:35:50.160 --> 06:35:51.830 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
motorcycles

06:35:51.830 --> 06:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
motorcycles
 
06:35:56.390 --> 06:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
snowball bills and possibly even boats
 
06:35:59.270 --> 06:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
and we do did learn from
 
06:36:01.910 --> 06:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
the lobbyists that such devices are
 
06:36:05.670 --> 06:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
available for all those vehicles so
 
06:36:08.390 --> 06:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's unclear if they really want to
 
06:36:09.910 --> 06:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
limit this to
 
06:36:13.190 --> 06:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
automotive our vehicles for the road
 
06:36:16.548 --> 06:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
that that was not stated
 
06:36:18.708 --> 06:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
so this is we're talking about a
 
06:36:20.310 --> 06:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
06:36:23.190 --> 06:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
a year for each vehicle
 
06:36:25.430 --> 06:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna
 
06:36:27.190 --> 06:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
remain opposed
 
06:36:30.310 --> 06:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:31.910 --> 06:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
and i just would say representative
 
06:36:34.070 --> 06:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
ordinate the existing law is that any
 
06:36:35.430 --> 06:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle registered to that person
 
06:36:37.350 --> 06:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
already would have require
 
06:36:38.788 --> 06:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
the interlocking device so that's the
 
06:36:41.030 --> 06:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
existing law what this is changing is
 
06:36:43.910 --> 06:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's or used by that person on a
 
06:36:45.670 --> 06:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
regular basis so the right it's just
 
06:36:47.430 --> 06:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
striking the regular basis so strictly
 
06:36:49.190 --> 06:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
they're using a vehicle
 
06:36:49.200 --> 06:36:50.230 align:start position:0%
they're using a vehicle
and

06:36:50.230 --> 06:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:36:51.750 --> 06:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
the point of that interlocking device if
 
06:36:53.670 --> 06:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
they're using a vehicle is to
 
06:36:56.948 --> 06:36:56.958 align:start position:0%
well have to use the interlocking device
 
06:36:59.190 --> 06:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
so it should apply to any vehicle so
 
06:37:02.708 --> 06:37:02.718 align:start position:0%
when i re-redirect you yes
 
06:37:05.750 --> 06:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
but that striking those three words
 
06:37:07.190 --> 06:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
means that
 
06:37:08.548 --> 06:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
vehicles that
 
06:37:11.670 --> 06:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
06:37:13.590 --> 06:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
perpetrator has
 
06:37:15.910 --> 06:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
in his household but never uses has to
 
06:37:17.270 --> 06:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
06:37:17.280 --> 06:37:20.390 align:start position:0%
be uh
interlocked

06:37:20.390 --> 06:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:20.400 --> 06:37:21.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:37:21.190 --> 06:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:37:23.750 --> 06:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
that does put a different emphasis
 
06:37:24.788 --> 06:37:24.798 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
06:37:28.468 --> 06:37:28.478 align:start position:0%
uh being the vehicles that the
 
06:37:30.150 --> 06:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
person uses
 
06:37:33.430 --> 06:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis basis
 
06:37:35.830 --> 06:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
which would probably want they want to
 
06:37:38.310 --> 06:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
mean any vehicle that they're likely to
 
06:37:40.948 --> 06:37:40.958 align:start position:0%
use should have interlock device
 
06:37:43.670 --> 06:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
means all vehicles in that household
 
06:37:46.150 --> 06:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
have to be have intellectual advice that
 
06:37:49.110 --> 06:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
means if their spouse is going to be
 
06:37:52.150 --> 06:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
driving a vehicle they are also subject
 
06:37:52.160 --> 06:37:53.030 align:start position:0%
driving a vehicle they are also subject
to

06:37:53.030 --> 06:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:37:54.948 --> 06:37:54.958 align:start position:0%
the inconvenience of the interlock
 
06:37:57.350 --> 06:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
device while they are operating that
 
06:37:57.360 --> 06:37:59.110 align:start position:0%
device while they are operating that
vehicle

06:37:59.110 --> 06:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
06:38:02.708 --> 06:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
unless they register to themselves
 
06:38:06.310 --> 06:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
my my interpretation is that if if the
 
06:38:08.070 --> 06:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle's not registered in there in
 
06:38:09.590 --> 06:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
that person's name it's wretched in
 
06:38:11.830 --> 06:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
their spouse's name or partner's name or
 
06:38:14.708 --> 06:38:14.718 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever then in that scenario
 
06:38:16.230 --> 06:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't require an interlocking
 
06:38:18.310 --> 06:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
device now if they were to use their
 
06:38:19.590 --> 06:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
spouse's car
 
06:38:21.110 --> 06:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's different
 
06:38:22.150 --> 06:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
they would
 
06:38:23.910 --> 06:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
that would be problematic and it's up to
 
06:38:26.230 --> 06:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
that's the decision they would be making
 
06:38:27.590 --> 06:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
on whether they want to put one in both
 
06:38:30.310 --> 06:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
vehicles is just one of them
 
06:38:31.990 --> 06:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
you may respond
 
06:38:34.150 --> 06:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know about your household but
 
06:38:36.868 --> 06:38:36.878 align:start position:0%
in my household all our vehicles are
 
06:38:40.788 --> 06:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
registered by both myself and my spouse
 
06:38:43.990 --> 06:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:45.430 --> 06:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
i think that that's
 
06:38:48.948 --> 06:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
the case for most households
 
06:38:48.958 --> 06:38:49.750 align:start position:0%
the case for most households
well

06:38:49.750 --> 06:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:38:51.510 --> 06:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
i understand i understand the concern
 
06:38:53.350 --> 06:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
you're raising i will just say that that
 
06:38:56.708 --> 06:38:56.718 align:start position:0%
is a problem the existing law
 
06:38:59.430 --> 06:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
i disagree it's not an existing law it
 
06:39:05.190 --> 06:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:06.868 --> 06:39:06.878 align:start position:0%
we'll just we're going to go on this one
 
06:39:08.788 --> 06:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
representative wallace and
 
06:39:11.110 --> 06:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh recognizing mr chairman
 
06:39:12.390 --> 06:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
just another
 
06:39:14.390 --> 06:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
to carry on with your discussion um as
 
06:39:15.670 --> 06:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
somebody who has
 
06:39:17.270 --> 06:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
many years experience installing and
 
06:39:19.030 --> 06:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
calibrating these devices
 
06:39:19.040 --> 06:39:20.390 align:start position:0%
calibrating these devices
um

06:39:20.390 --> 06:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:22.230 --> 06:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is a designed to address a
 
06:39:22.240 --> 06:39:23.830 align:start position:0%
this bill is a designed to address a
loophole

06:39:23.830 --> 06:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
loophole
 
06:39:25.910 --> 06:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
i've had many clients that would drive
 
06:39:27.270 --> 06:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
their motorcycle because from a
 
06:39:29.030 --> 06:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
liability perspective i would never
 
06:39:31.430 --> 06:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
install a breathalyzer interlock because
 
06:39:33.750 --> 06:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
it does require an additional blow
 
06:39:35.110 --> 06:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
randomly and frequently as you're
 
06:39:37.190 --> 06:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
driving on the road and that's not very
 
06:39:40.708 --> 06:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
safety minded on a motorcycle
 
06:39:40.718 --> 06:39:42.468 align:start position:0%
safety minded on a motorcycle
another

06:39:42.468 --> 06:39:42.478 align:start position:0%
another
 
06:39:45.190 --> 06:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
item addressed in this bill is the dmv
 
06:39:47.430 --> 06:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
will mark the driver's license in some
 
06:39:50.868 --> 06:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
manner for these people so that um
 
06:39:54.070 --> 06:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
if they go to register excuse me rent a
 
06:39:55.430 --> 06:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle you're going to have to
 
06:39:57.270 --> 06:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
produce your driver's license
 
06:39:58.868 --> 06:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
there may not have access to your
 
06:40:01.110 --> 06:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
driving record but with that mark of the
 
06:40:03.110 --> 06:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
beast on your license they're not going
 
06:40:05.030 --> 06:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
to rent you an automobile because it
 
06:40:07.190 --> 06:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that interlock device
 
06:40:08.868 --> 06:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
thereby preventing that work around of
 
06:40:10.310 --> 06:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
the system that we've got in place to
 
06:40:10.320 --> 06:40:11.350 align:start position:0%
the system that we've got in place to
prevent

06:40:11.350 --> 06:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
06:40:12.948 --> 06:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
these individuals from operating on the
 
06:40:14.868 --> 06:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
road under while they're impaired uh
 
06:40:19.910 --> 06:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:22.468 --> 06:40:22.478 align:start position:0%
representative harry gathered thank you
 
06:40:23.670 --> 06:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
so are you
 
06:40:25.350 --> 06:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
can i just ask him a question what he
 
06:40:27.590 --> 06:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
just said so you're saying that these
 
06:40:30.310 --> 06:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
people have something on their license
 
06:40:32.150 --> 06:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
no there's a provision in the bill that
 
06:40:34.468 --> 06:40:34.478 align:start position:0%
the dmv will mark their driver's license
 
06:40:36.310 --> 06:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
and put a decal on their registration
 
06:40:38.390 --> 06:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
plate so it's blatantly obvious to the
 
06:40:40.150 --> 06:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
motoring public and to people that may
 
06:40:41.990 --> 06:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
look at their driver's license that they
 
06:40:43.670 --> 06:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
have a requirement for
 
06:40:43.680 --> 06:40:45.190 align:start position:0%
have a requirement for
um

06:40:45.190 --> 06:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:47.110 --> 06:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
this interlock device so you know if
 
06:40:48.948 --> 06:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
they're exhibiting lane control issues
 
06:40:50.868 --> 06:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
maybe they're trying to operate this uh
 
06:40:52.310 --> 06:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
the interlock while they're driving down
 
06:40:54.150 --> 06:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
the road
 
06:40:55.910 --> 06:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
and maybe some would drop a dime if
 
06:40:57.750 --> 06:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
they're having problems
 
06:41:00.868 --> 06:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
okay so i i too thought this was a good
 
06:41:00.878 --> 06:41:01.910 align:start position:0%
okay so i i too thought this was a good
bill

06:41:01.910 --> 06:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:41:01.920 --> 06:41:02.628 align:start position:0%
bill
but

06:41:02.628 --> 06:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:41:04.468 --> 06:41:04.478 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna say last year whenever we had
 
06:41:05.990 --> 06:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
this before i probably never read it
 
06:41:06.000 --> 06:41:06.948 align:start position:0%
this before i probably never read it
through

06:41:06.948 --> 06:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
through
 
06:41:09.430 --> 06:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
but today in reading through it that
 
06:41:11.430 --> 06:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
part of the build that states you know
 
06:41:11.440 --> 06:41:12.230 align:start position:0%
part of the build that states you know
that

06:41:12.230 --> 06:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:41:14.948 --> 06:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
any any and every car that you own would
 
06:41:17.110 --> 06:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
have to be um you would have to have
 
06:41:19.510 --> 06:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
that device on it um
 
06:41:21.190 --> 06:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
i thought this was a good way to clean
 
06:41:22.390 --> 06:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
that up
 
06:41:24.468 --> 06:41:24.478 align:start position:0%
and that was my recommendation to the
 
06:41:24.478 --> 06:41:25.750 align:start position:0%
and that was my recommendation to the
representative

06:41:25.750 --> 06:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:41:27.190 --> 06:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
however um
 
06:41:29.270 --> 06:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
after she left she did send us an email
 
06:41:30.868 --> 06:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
a few of us are emailed
 
06:41:33.110 --> 06:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
and she chose not to do
 
06:41:36.150 --> 06:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
to put in you know to clean up the bill
 
06:41:37.510 --> 06:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
so that it would be
 
06:41:40.390 --> 06:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
pallable to the entire team
 
06:41:43.030 --> 06:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
so um with that said i don't think i can
 
06:41:43.040 --> 06:41:44.310 align:start position:0%
so um with that said i don't think i can
um

06:41:44.310 --> 06:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:41:44.320 --> 06:41:45.190 align:start position:0%
um
vote

06:41:45.190 --> 06:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
vote
 
06:41:47.670 --> 06:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill
 
06:41:50.468 --> 06:41:50.478 align:start position:0%
because i don't really believe that
 
06:41:52.310 --> 06:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
anyone i don't care how many vehicles
 
06:41:54.548 --> 06:41:54.558 align:start position:0%
you have and what they said was that
 
06:41:56.948 --> 06:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
the um motorcycle anything that's
 
06:41:58.948 --> 06:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
drivable is supposed to have a lot
 
06:42:00.468 --> 06:42:00.478 align:start position:0%
that's what
 
06:42:03.510 --> 06:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
these one of these people said
 
06:42:06.628 --> 06:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
okay so let's say you have 10 vehicles
 
06:42:08.868 --> 06:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
or whatever in some or
 
06:42:10.548 --> 06:42:10.558 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle whatever you want to call
 
06:42:13.030 --> 06:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
them anything that you can drive
 
06:42:14.788 --> 06:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
you would have to pay
 
06:42:17.590 --> 06:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
150 or whatever whatever the cost is for
 
06:42:19.510 --> 06:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
every last one of those vehicles i don't
 
06:42:21.510 --> 06:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i just think that's
 
06:42:24.150 --> 06:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
unreasonable yes and did
 
06:42:25.548 --> 06:42:25.558 align:start position:0%
you maybe mr
 
06:42:27.430 --> 06:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
represe i think this went to
 
06:42:29.430 --> 06:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
transportation committee last year not
 
06:42:31.030 --> 06:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
to us
 
06:42:33.270 --> 06:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh representing okay i thought it came
 
06:42:34.948 --> 06:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
to us and i must have read didn't read
 
06:42:36.310 --> 06:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
at all or something
 
06:42:38.230 --> 06:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
but i took this says
 
06:42:40.070 --> 06:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
even though i like what they wanted to
 
06:42:42.310 --> 06:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
do with the bill i still felt it was an
 
06:42:44.628 --> 06:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity to clean up the bill and i
 
06:42:46.788 --> 06:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
feel that was rejected
 
06:42:49.110 --> 06:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
well just from the technical aspects of
 
06:42:52.070 --> 06:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
it if you're a multiple vehicle owner
 
06:42:54.628 --> 06:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
there are multiple units
 
06:42:57.030 --> 06:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
that are installed into the vehicles but
 
06:42:59.110 --> 06:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
there's only one breathalyzer
 
06:43:00.948 --> 06:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
okay this
 
06:43:03.030 --> 06:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
they might have a spare but that handset
 
06:43:05.350 --> 06:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
is the breathalyzer unit itself and it
 
06:43:06.948 --> 06:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
communicates with the interlock in the
 
06:43:09.110 --> 06:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
car so where they can only operate one
 
06:43:10.868 --> 06:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
vehicle at a time or maybe there's a
 
06:43:12.230 --> 06:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
spouse they may have an additional
 
06:43:14.628 --> 06:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
handset so it's not a complete
 
06:43:17.350 --> 06:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
1500 install in each vehicle
 
06:43:19.750 --> 06:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay they might have that interlock the
 
06:43:21.830 --> 06:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
the component that disables the start
 
06:43:24.150 --> 06:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
circuit okay and you don't leave the
 
06:43:25.830 --> 06:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
breathalyzer in the vehicle because it's
 
06:43:27.670 --> 06:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
temperature sensitive you keep that in
 
06:43:29.030 --> 06:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
your home with you and you bring it out
 
06:43:30.868 --> 06:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
in the morning and plug it into the car
 
06:43:33.030 --> 06:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
you blow through it you get a clean
 
06:43:34.468 --> 06:43:34.478 align:start position:0%
sample it allows you to start the
 
06:43:34.478 --> 06:43:35.510 align:start position:0%
sample it allows you to start the
vehicle

06:43:35.510 --> 06:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
06:43:35.520 --> 06:43:36.628 align:start position:0%
vehicle
so

06:43:36.628 --> 06:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:43:36.638 --> 06:43:37.910 align:start position:0%
so
it's

06:43:37.910 --> 06:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:43:39.590 --> 06:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
one more question then you said it was
 
06:43:39.600 --> 06:43:50.628 align:start position:0%
one more question then you said it was
1500

06:43:50.628 --> 06:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:52.628 --> 06:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
but even with that that's even worse
 
06:43:54.628 --> 06:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
well just like financing an automobile
 
06:43:55.830 --> 06:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
you can do it different ways you can
 
06:43:57.750 --> 06:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
lease it you can buy it outright or you
 
06:43:59.830 --> 06:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
can buy it you can put some money down
 
06:44:02.150 --> 06:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
we did it all a myriad of ways most
 
06:44:05.110 --> 06:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
people just paid a monthly lease rate um
 
06:44:06.628 --> 06:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
but there was an advantage paying it off
 
06:44:08.788 --> 06:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
up front so
 
06:44:10.708 --> 06:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
06:44:17.190 --> 06:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:19.110 --> 06:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative boarding
 
06:44:20.948 --> 06:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
especially when he brought up the point
 
06:44:24.468 --> 06:44:24.478 align:start position:0%
about vehicles that are registered to
 
06:44:26.390 --> 06:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
both spouses
 
06:44:28.390 --> 06:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
and if you read just the wording of the
 
06:44:28.400 --> 06:44:29.910 align:start position:0%
and if you read just the wording of the
bill

06:44:29.910 --> 06:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:44:32.150 --> 06:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
if i can find it here that
 
06:44:34.310 --> 06:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
they shall be required by the court
 
06:44:37.110 --> 06:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
after a period
 
06:44:43.030 --> 06:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
as defined in rsa 259 43 in any vehicle
 
06:44:45.350 --> 06:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
registered to that person
 
06:44:47.750 --> 06:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
or used by that person
 
06:44:49.990 --> 06:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
and then they removed what used to be
 
06:44:52.708 --> 06:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
the out that would confine it to
 
06:44:54.230 --> 06:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't require it to go on more than
 
06:44:55.750 --> 06:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
one vehicle
 
06:44:58.150 --> 06:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh and it goes on from there
 
06:45:00.468 --> 06:45:00.478 align:start position:0%
and so i think that what you have just
 
06:45:02.150 --> 06:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
because the wording is the way the
 
06:45:03.990 --> 06:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
wording is
 
06:45:06.788 --> 06:45:06.798 align:start position:0%
is that if you take out the exception
 
06:45:09.190 --> 06:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
and that's what we want to do
 
06:45:11.030 --> 06:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
then for
 
06:45:13.350 --> 06:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are registered to two
 
06:45:14.868 --> 06:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
different people and if that's all the
 
06:45:18.070 --> 06:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
vehicles in the house this would require
 
06:45:18.080 --> 06:45:19.190 align:start position:0%
vehicles in the house this would require
a

06:45:19.190 --> 06:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:45:21.990 --> 06:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
require that you install one in each one
 
06:45:24.390 --> 06:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
that is registered to that person
 
06:45:26.310 --> 06:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
because we've removed the exception so i
 
06:45:28.230 --> 06:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
think that's the first point and the
 
06:45:30.468 --> 06:45:30.478 align:start position:0%
second point is even if it's not a now
 
06:45:31.670 --> 06:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
i'm confused about whether it's a
 
06:45:33.510 --> 06:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
breathalyzer or whether it's a unit in
 
06:45:34.868 --> 06:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
the car
 
06:45:37.030 --> 06:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
you would have to buy at least you would
 
06:45:39.590 --> 06:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
have to install in my reading of the
 
06:45:43.110 --> 06:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
words at least whatever component is a
 
06:45:45.030 --> 06:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
breathalyzer whatever that means or
 
06:45:47.110 --> 06:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
whatever interlocking device whatever
 
06:45:48.788 --> 06:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
that is you would have to install it in
 
06:45:50.468 --> 06:45:50.478 align:start position:0%
three cars
 
06:45:51.750 --> 06:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
where you had
 
06:45:58.390 --> 06:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:03.190 --> 06:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:04.708 --> 06:46:04.718 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
06:46:07.030 --> 06:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative gathright and the other
 
06:46:09.910 --> 06:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative newman covered most of my
 
06:46:12.310 --> 06:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
thoughts but i'm stuck on
 
06:46:15.510 --> 06:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
on line 23 where it says in any vehicle
 
06:46:18.070 --> 06:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
registered to that person or
 
06:46:21.990 --> 06:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
used by that person so is this an
 
06:46:24.628 --> 06:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say either or it
 
06:46:27.030 --> 06:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
so i i didn't know if that was some way
 
06:46:29.670 --> 06:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
that somebody had two cars
 
06:46:31.830 --> 06:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
registered or three whatever they could
 
06:46:34.548 --> 06:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
say no this is the car i use on a
 
06:46:37.110 --> 06:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
regular basis so i only need to install
 
06:46:40.310 --> 06:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
the complete gizmo on this one but not
 
06:46:40.320 --> 06:46:41.750 align:start position:0%
the complete gizmo on this one but not
those

06:46:41.750 --> 06:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
06:46:41.760 --> 06:46:42.548 align:start position:0%
those
so

06:46:42.548 --> 06:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:46:44.070 --> 06:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
what i can what i this is my
 
06:46:45.910 --> 06:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
interpretation and this is the existing
 
06:46:48.230 --> 06:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
law that take this bill even if we don't
 
06:46:49.830 --> 06:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
pass it
 
06:46:52.230 --> 06:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
any vehicle that is registered to the
 
06:46:54.230 --> 06:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
individual's name if they're required to
 
06:46:54.240 --> 06:46:55.110 align:start position:0%
individual's name if they're required to
get

06:46:55.110 --> 06:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
get
 
06:46:56.948 --> 06:46:56.958 align:start position:0%
the interlocking
 
06:46:59.990 --> 06:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
device in their vehicle any vehicle
 
06:47:02.230 --> 06:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
registered to them period would whether
 
06:47:04.150 --> 06:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
it's their name their name and their
 
06:47:05.510 --> 06:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
spouse's name
 
06:47:07.990 --> 06:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
would require their the interlocking
 
06:47:10.708 --> 06:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
device to be installed in the vehicle
 
06:47:12.788 --> 06:47:12.798 align:start position:0%
it also would be required to be
 
06:47:14.788 --> 06:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
installed in vehicles not registered in
 
06:47:16.070 --> 06:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
their name
 
06:47:18.708 --> 06:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
that they operate on a regular basis the
 
06:47:20.708 --> 06:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
issue is
 
06:47:22.708 --> 06:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
operate on a regular basis what does
 
06:47:24.390 --> 06:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
that mean how frequent would one have to
 
06:47:27.110 --> 06:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
use a vehicle for it to then be
 
06:47:27.120 --> 06:47:28.150 align:start position:0%
use a vehicle for it to then be
considered

06:47:28.150 --> 06:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
considered
 
06:47:29.750 --> 06:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis
 
06:47:31.510 --> 06:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
and what i understood the testimony to
 
06:47:32.868 --> 06:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
be from the
 
06:47:34.310 --> 06:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative who
 
06:47:37.270 --> 06:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
sponsored the bill and introduced it was
 
06:47:39.990 --> 06:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
that on the regular basis the intent is
 
06:47:42.468 --> 06:47:42.478 align:start position:0%
anytime this individual's operating any
 
06:47:43.830 --> 06:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle whether it's registered their
 
06:47:45.270 --> 06:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
name or not
 
06:47:47.270 --> 06:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
is to take the
 
06:47:49.830 --> 06:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh to take the breath test and to use
 
06:47:52.310 --> 06:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
the interlocking device so
 
06:47:54.310 --> 06:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
existing law that's already the case
 
06:47:55.750 --> 06:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
what this is just doing is clarifying
 
06:47:57.510 --> 06:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
that it you don't have to
 
06:48:00.150 --> 06:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
establish on a regular basis
 
06:48:01.990 --> 06:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
so if i were to use if i'm required by
 
06:48:04.070 --> 06:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
the court to use the interlocking device
 
06:48:04.080 --> 06:48:04.788 align:start position:0%
the court to use the interlocking device
and

06:48:04.788 --> 06:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:48:06.948 --> 06:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
you lend me your vehicle i although it's
 
06:48:08.948 --> 06:48:08.958 align:start position:0%
a nice gesture uh
 
06:48:10.230 --> 06:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
if the
 
06:48:11.750 --> 06:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
interlocking device is not installed in
 
06:48:13.750 --> 06:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
there i would not be permitted to
 
06:48:15.190 --> 06:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
operate it
 
06:48:17.110 --> 06:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass if i only use it
 
06:48:18.230 --> 06:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
one time
 
06:48:21.190 --> 06:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:22.628 --> 06:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't need to do it under the
 
06:48:23.990 --> 06:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
current law but the problem with that is
 
06:48:25.430 --> 06:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
i'm getting around the requirement that
 
06:48:27.030 --> 06:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
the court made that i
 
06:48:28.868 --> 06:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
use that interlocking device and and
 
06:48:30.628 --> 06:48:30.638 align:start position:0%
just to clarify what representative
 
06:48:32.230 --> 06:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
wallace just said
 
06:48:34.628 --> 06:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't think i heard this
 
06:48:36.628 --> 06:48:36.638 align:start position:0%
morning maybe i don't remember but this
 
06:48:38.468 --> 06:48:38.478 align:start position:0%
is the first time i'm hearing that if
 
06:48:41.030 --> 06:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
you got three cars you could get three
 
06:48:44.150 --> 06:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
sets of things but only one would be the
 
06:48:44.160 --> 06:48:45.430 align:start position:0%
sets of things but only one would be the
full

06:48:45.430 --> 06:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
full
 
06:48:47.270 --> 06:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
the full one that
 
06:48:49.270 --> 06:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
you would be expected to use or do you
 
06:48:51.910 --> 06:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
move it from one to another yes
 
06:48:53.510 --> 06:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
the systems i don't know if you remember
 
06:48:55.270 --> 06:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
back you know 20 years ago when we
 
06:48:57.030 --> 06:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
actually installed security systems in
 
06:48:58.548 --> 06:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
the cars when they didn't come factory
 
06:49:00.150 --> 06:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
equipped you'd have something that would
 
06:49:02.468 --> 06:49:02.478 align:start position:0%
prevent the car from being started
 
06:49:04.150 --> 06:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
that's the only part that remains in the
 
06:49:05.990 --> 06:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
car the little handset regardless of the
 
06:49:08.708 --> 06:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
manufacturer is on a little coiled cord
 
06:49:10.628 --> 06:49:10.638 align:start position:0%
and that remains with the individual
 
06:49:12.468 --> 06:49:12.478 align:start position:0%
because that's what's very expensive and
 
06:49:14.548 --> 06:49:14.558 align:start position:0%
it has a proprietary technology in it
 
06:49:16.468 --> 06:49:16.478 align:start position:0%
and is required to be calibrated on a
 
06:49:19.350 --> 06:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
monthly basis that goes into the office
 
06:49:20.868 --> 06:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
with the people it goes in their home so
 
06:49:23.350 --> 06:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
they can just move that from car to car
 
06:49:25.110 --> 06:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
and that contains all the data that what
 
06:49:26.628 --> 06:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
we call the handset
 
06:49:28.628 --> 06:49:28.638 align:start position:0%
okay if but you could only operate one
 
06:49:30.310 --> 06:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle at a time so if you've got
 
06:49:32.548 --> 06:49:32.558 align:start position:0%
multiple drivers you would probably in
 
06:49:34.628 --> 06:49:34.638 align:start position:0%
reality need at least two complete
 
06:49:37.270 --> 06:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
systems so that in the event that one
 
06:49:39.190 --> 06:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle is out of the driveway you still
 
06:49:41.430 --> 06:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
got a handset to run that other vehicle
 
06:49:43.030 --> 06:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
because unless you're trained you're not
 
06:49:45.030 --> 06:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
gonna be able to get it started
 
06:49:47.350 --> 06:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative jack uh thank
 
06:49:48.868 --> 06:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman uh the chairman did a
 
06:49:50.868 --> 06:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
great job of pointing out that line five
 
06:49:53.990 --> 06:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
is is verbatim in existing law
 
06:49:56.628 --> 06:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
and it says because of the word or at
 
06:49:59.350 --> 06:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
the end that any vehicle registered to
 
06:50:00.868 --> 06:50:00.878 align:start position:0%
that person
 
06:50:02.868 --> 06:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
has to have the interlock device that's
 
06:50:04.948 --> 06:50:04.958 align:start position:0%
existing loss so voting against this
 
06:50:06.948 --> 06:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
bill to
 
06:50:08.788 --> 06:50:08.798 align:start position:0%
circumvent that isn't going to solve
 
06:50:10.310 --> 06:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
your problem
 
06:50:11.910 --> 06:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
there does seem to be there has been a
 
06:50:15.110 --> 06:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
lot of sense in the committee today that
 
06:50:19.190 --> 06:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
that requirement isn't a good idea
 
06:50:20.390 --> 06:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
but but
 
06:50:23.270 --> 06:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is this bill
 
06:50:26.070 --> 06:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
well unamended this bill is not voting
 
06:50:28.310 --> 06:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
against this bill is not solving your
 
06:50:28.320 --> 06:50:29.190 align:start position:0%
against this bill is not solving your
issue

06:50:29.190 --> 06:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
issue
 
06:50:30.708 --> 06:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
let me suggest a couple of ways you
 
06:50:32.788 --> 06:50:32.798 align:start position:0%
could proceed you could hold the bill
 
06:50:34.628 --> 06:50:34.638 align:start position:0%
and do an amendment the department of
 
06:50:37.110 --> 06:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
safety was a little leery about agreeing
 
06:50:38.628 --> 06:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
to that amendment
 
06:50:40.948 --> 06:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
in real time
 
06:50:43.190 --> 06:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
so if you were to hold the bill if you
 
06:50:44.788 --> 06:50:44.798 align:start position:0%
had another executive session you could
 
06:50:46.948 --> 06:50:46.958 align:start position:0%
hold the bill and amend it it does seem
 
06:50:48.868 --> 06:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
that the that the committee is very
 
06:50:51.430 --> 06:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
interested in deleting that requirement
 
06:50:51.440 --> 06:50:52.310 align:start position:0%
interested in deleting that requirement
uh

06:50:52.310 --> 06:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:50:53.990 --> 06:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
you could file a bill next year to
 
06:50:56.230 --> 06:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
delete the requirement you could try to
 
06:50:58.150 --> 06:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
get the senate to amend it
 
06:51:00.708 --> 06:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
but voting against this bill today as it
 
06:51:02.788 --> 06:51:02.798 align:start position:0%
sits does not
 
06:51:05.990 --> 06:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
help with with the the concern that a
 
06:51:07.670 --> 06:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
lot of the committee has about that
 
06:51:07.680 --> 06:51:08.708 align:start position:0%
lot of the committee has about that
language

06:51:08.708 --> 06:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
language
 
06:51:16.468 --> 06:51:16.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:19.110 --> 06:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative espitia yeah i i agree
 
06:51:21.190 --> 06:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
with uh with the statement of uh
 
06:51:23.590 --> 06:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative jack i think you know
 
06:51:23.600 --> 06:51:24.548 align:start position:0%
representative jack i think you know
while

06:51:24.548 --> 06:51:24.558 align:start position:0%
while
 
06:51:26.708 --> 06:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
sure there are there are some issues
 
06:51:28.548 --> 06:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
with the existing law i don't think this
 
06:51:30.230 --> 06:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
bill is meant to address those issues
 
06:51:31.830 --> 06:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is too meant to address the
 
06:51:31.840 --> 06:51:32.948 align:start position:0%
this bill is too meant to address the
loophole

06:51:32.948 --> 06:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
loophole
 
06:51:35.990 --> 06:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
um that is currently that you know
 
06:51:37.910 --> 06:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
that is something that you know i think
 
06:51:41.190 --> 06:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of us can try to get behind um
 
06:51:42.868 --> 06:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
so i think you know i want to support
 
06:51:43.990 --> 06:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:51:49.350 --> 06:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:49.360 --> 06:51:50.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:51:50.830 --> 06:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:51:53.910 --> 06:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
true thank you mr chair well
 
06:51:55.590 --> 06:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
most of it's already been said but i'll
 
06:51:57.510 --> 06:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
say it again because
 
06:52:01.590 --> 06:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:04.150 --> 06:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
i hear the argument that
 
06:52:06.868 --> 06:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
any vehicle registered to that person is
 
06:52:08.788 --> 06:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
is already part of
 
06:52:11.750 --> 06:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
the the law well so is on a regular
 
06:52:14.868 --> 06:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
basis already part of the law
 
06:52:14.878 --> 06:52:18.390 align:start position:0%
basis already part of the law
um

06:52:18.390 --> 06:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:21.830 --> 06:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
in three and three places on this bill
 
06:52:24.868 --> 06:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
the law as it's now written says
 
06:52:26.788 --> 06:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
that you must
 
06:52:29.910 --> 06:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
spend all this money on any vehicle
 
06:52:34.948 --> 06:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:36.468 --> 06:52:36.478 align:start position:0%
that seems
 
06:52:38.708 --> 06:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
very uh
 
06:52:41.350 --> 06:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
a strong too strong a punishment
 
06:52:41.360 --> 06:52:43.350 align:start position:0%
a strong too strong a punishment
financially

06:52:43.350 --> 06:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
financially
 
06:52:47.270 --> 06:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:50.230 --> 06:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
and and that can be easily corrected
 
06:52:52.548 --> 06:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
if we uh
 
06:52:54.310 --> 06:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
stall long enough
 
06:52:57.110 --> 06:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh to another day so that
 
06:52:59.910 --> 06:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment dropping that any vehicle
 
06:53:02.788 --> 06:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
registered to that person and dropping
 
06:53:05.350 --> 06:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
the on a regular basis will certainly
 
06:53:07.270 --> 06:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
get my support
 
06:53:07.280 --> 06:53:09.270 align:start position:0%
get my support
because

06:53:09.270 --> 06:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:53:11.670 --> 06:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
forcing somebody to register for cars
 
06:53:13.350 --> 06:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
because they're registered under his net
 
06:53:15.670 --> 06:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
for do the interlock
 
06:53:17.350 --> 06:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
on four cars because they happen to be
 
06:53:19.110 --> 06:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
registered under his name
 
06:53:21.670 --> 06:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
is not going to stop him from borrowing
 
06:53:24.150 --> 06:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
daryl's car tomorrow
 
06:53:25.430 --> 06:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's not going to stop him from
 
06:53:27.350 --> 06:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
borrowing anyone's car
 
06:53:29.430 --> 06:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have the interlock that
 
06:53:31.190 --> 06:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's on to the that's on the
 
06:53:33.590 --> 06:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
person the person know that knows they
 
06:53:36.150 --> 06:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
messed up and they have to follow the
 
06:53:38.468 --> 06:53:38.478 align:start position:0%
court orders
 
06:53:41.590 --> 06:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
but forcing somebody
 
06:53:44.628 --> 06:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
to uh put this interlock on any vehicle
 
06:53:46.390 --> 06:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
registered to that person
 
06:53:48.468 --> 06:53:48.478 align:start position:0%
when that doesn't that doesn't serve any
 
06:53:51.030 --> 06:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
purpose at all
 
06:53:53.430 --> 06:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
is why i can't support
 
06:53:56.868 --> 06:53:56.878 align:start position:0%
the otp and i would hope that
 
06:53:58.948 --> 06:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go through today
 
06:54:01.110 --> 06:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
so that uh perhaps
 
06:54:03.190 --> 06:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
removing any vehicle registered to that
 
06:54:03.200 --> 06:54:04.548 align:start position:0%
removing any vehicle registered to that
person

06:54:04.548 --> 06:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
person
 
06:54:07.190 --> 06:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
and removing on a regular basis will do
 
06:54:09.670 --> 06:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what this bill
 
06:54:12.468 --> 06:54:12.478 align:start position:0%
has presented meant to do
 
06:54:18.948 --> 06:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:22.948 --> 06:54:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:24.868 --> 06:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:54:28.788 --> 06:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
i will not be long-winded
 
06:54:31.670 --> 06:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
i will be voting to itl and not approve
 
06:54:34.070 --> 06:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
the motion that ought to pass i will be
 
06:54:39.510 --> 06:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:41.430 --> 06:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
representative burke
 
06:54:43.430 --> 06:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
06:54:45.430 --> 06:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
i think if scott could answer i'm
 
06:54:47.110 --> 06:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
assuming it would be him to answer this
 
06:54:48.628 --> 06:54:48.638 align:start position:0%
question because i just want to
 
06:54:48.638 --> 06:54:50.788 align:start position:0%
question because i just want to
understand

06:54:50.788 --> 06:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
understand
 
06:54:52.468 --> 06:54:52.478 align:start position:0%
is it current law
 
06:54:53.590 --> 06:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
right now
 
06:54:57.190 --> 06:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
or is it proposed law
 
06:55:01.910 --> 06:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
i have a 53 farm all super c tractor
 
06:55:04.788 --> 06:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
a car and a truck that i
 
06:55:04.798 --> 06:55:06.310 align:start position:0%
a car and a truck that i
drive

06:55:06.310 --> 06:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
drive
 
06:55:09.110 --> 06:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
then my wife has a car
 
06:55:09.120 --> 06:55:10.548 align:start position:0%
then my wife has a car
that

06:55:10.548 --> 06:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:55:12.788 --> 06:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
i will drive once a week when i go fill
 
06:55:16.548 --> 06:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:19.270 --> 06:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
and occasionally other times but most of
 
06:55:21.030 --> 06:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
the time i drive the other cars you know
 
06:55:22.868 --> 06:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
so would i have to install them in all
 
06:55:26.150 --> 06:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
four vehicles and if the answer is yes
 
06:55:28.150 --> 06:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
let's say if i was the dwi person which
 
06:55:29.510 --> 06:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
i don't drink
 
06:55:31.910 --> 06:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
but if i did and
 
06:55:33.510 --> 06:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
would i have to you know would it be
 
06:55:35.910 --> 06:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
installed in all four vehicles and how
 
06:55:38.628 --> 06:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
would my wife be able to drive her car
 
06:55:41.510 --> 06:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
to work if there's one of those devices
 
06:55:43.750 --> 06:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
in her car because i do occasionally
 
06:55:46.390 --> 06:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
drive it so i'm just curious how this is
 
06:55:46.400 --> 06:55:47.830 align:start position:0%
drive it so i'm just curious how this is
works

06:55:47.830 --> 06:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
works
 
06:55:49.750 --> 06:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:55:51.190 --> 06:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
06:55:52.788 --> 06:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be a need to put it on
 
06:55:55.030 --> 06:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
your tractor unless it's registered and
 
06:55:57.270 --> 06:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
driven on the road
 
06:55:57.280 --> 06:55:58.230 align:start position:0%
driven on the road
okay

06:55:58.230 --> 06:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:55:59.750 --> 06:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
well that's interesting
 
06:55:59.760 --> 06:56:04.628 align:start position:0%
well that's interesting
um

06:56:04.628 --> 06:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:07.030 --> 06:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
um it certainly is technically pause
 
06:56:09.510 --> 06:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
possible as far as operating the vehicle
 
06:56:11.430 --> 06:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
with the interlock
 
06:56:13.110 --> 06:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
she would have to operate that and it's
 
06:56:14.628 --> 06:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
quite a task
 
06:56:16.468 --> 06:56:16.478 align:start position:0%
if you've ever had a pulmonary function
 
06:56:17.670 --> 06:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
test or
 
06:56:19.910 --> 06:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
deep breathing exercises this is not
 
06:56:21.430 --> 06:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
something you just kind of breathe into
 
06:56:23.270 --> 06:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
you've got to breathe from the from your
 
06:56:24.948 --> 06:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
your bottom of your soul
 
06:56:26.548 --> 06:56:26.558 align:start position:0%
for and hold it
 
06:56:28.468 --> 06:56:28.478 align:start position:0%
and uh you know it's not the easiest
 
06:56:30.948 --> 06:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
thing to do so but that's how she would
 
06:56:33.350 --> 06:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
have to operate it
 
06:56:39.430 --> 06:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:40.868 --> 06:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
well what would happen is could you get
 
06:56:42.628 --> 06:56:42.638 align:start position:0%
around that device yes you could but it
 
06:56:47.510 --> 06:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
would also set a um uh a demerit into
 
06:56:49.030 --> 06:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
your unit it would be a you would be
 
06:56:50.708 --> 06:56:50.718 align:start position:0%
locked out it would detect that it had
 
06:56:52.868 --> 06:56:52.878 align:start position:0%
been bypassed and that would uh be a
 
06:56:54.708 --> 06:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
violation on your part and it would go
 
06:56:56.150 --> 06:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
on your record you'd have to answer to
 
06:56:58.390 --> 06:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
it with the dmv
 
06:57:01.110 --> 06:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
and representative burke in respect
 
06:57:03.750 --> 06:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
under the current law if you were to
 
06:57:05.670 --> 06:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
be a great husband and
 
06:57:07.110 --> 06:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
take your wife's vehicle to get filled
 
06:57:09.270 --> 06:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
up fill up the tank top it off once a
 
06:57:10.868 --> 06:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
week i would consider that to be
 
06:57:14.230 --> 06:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
operating the vehicle on a regular basis
 
06:57:15.750 --> 06:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's not even considering the random
 
06:57:18.150 --> 06:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
times you may just randomly drive it but
 
06:57:19.750 --> 06:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
so under the current law you would have
 
06:57:21.030 --> 06:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
to register
 
06:57:21.040 --> 06:57:21.830 align:start position:0%
to register
or

06:57:21.830 --> 06:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:57:25.110 --> 06:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
have the interlocking device installed
 
06:57:27.270 --> 06:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
into all the vehicles i will say the
 
06:57:29.430 --> 06:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
easiest way for an individual to avoid
 
06:57:29.440 --> 06:57:30.230 align:start position:0%
easiest way for an individual to avoid
this

06:57:30.230 --> 06:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:57:32.468 --> 06:57:32.478 align:start position:0%
hardship is to not
 
06:57:35.270 --> 06:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
commit multiple drunk driving offenses
 
06:57:35.280 --> 06:57:36.070 align:start position:0%
commit multiple drunk driving offenses
get

06:57:36.070 --> 06:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
get
 
06:57:37.910 --> 06:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
drink be double the legal limit and get
 
06:57:39.670 --> 06:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
arrested for drunk driving
 
06:57:42.390 --> 06:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
or being involved in an accident while
 
06:57:45.270 --> 06:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
impaired from drinking alcohol so this
 
06:57:48.150 --> 06:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
although i i do sympathize with the the
 
06:57:50.150 --> 06:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
i guess the uh
 
06:57:51.430 --> 06:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
some of the restraints this may put on
 
06:57:53.030 --> 06:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
an individual this is a very
 
06:57:55.430 --> 06:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
sim easy situation to
 
06:57:55.440 --> 06:57:56.948 align:start position:0%
sim easy situation to
avoid

06:57:56.948 --> 06:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
avoid
 
06:57:59.510 --> 06:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
in in my opinion so just throwing it out
 
06:58:02.548 --> 06:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
there representative welch
 
06:58:04.390 --> 06:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i really can't
 
06:58:06.070 --> 06:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
believe we're having this discussion
 
06:58:08.548 --> 06:58:08.558 align:start position:0%
over somebody who drives a car
 
06:58:08.558 --> 06:58:09.590 align:start position:0%
over somebody who drives a car
drunk

06:58:09.590 --> 06:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
drunk
 
06:58:12.150 --> 06:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
does anybody here know anyone who has
 
06:58:15.270 --> 06:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
lost a family member or a friend from a
 
06:58:16.788 --> 06:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
drunk driver
 
06:58:19.110 --> 06:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
i don't care what kind of a cost we put
 
06:58:21.350 --> 06:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
on a drunk driver i don't want him on
 
06:58:22.830 --> 06:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
the road
 
06:58:25.830 --> 06:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
yep ends up sorry
 
06:58:27.350 --> 06:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you for that moment of clarity
 
06:58:30.468 --> 06:58:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:33.270 --> 06:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
06:58:36.070 --> 06:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:58:37.670 --> 06:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
i've heard a lot of talk about you know
 
06:58:39.750 --> 06:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
um the person's gonna have to do this
 
06:58:41.590 --> 06:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
and we have to do that and
 
06:58:44.070 --> 06:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
let's get back the piggybacking off what
 
06:58:46.788 --> 06:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
what the chair said um driving's a
 
06:58:48.150 --> 06:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
privilege it's not a right you have a
 
06:58:49.750 --> 06:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
right to drive you're a privilege to
 
06:58:49.760 --> 06:58:50.708 align:start position:0%
right to drive you're a privilege to
drive

06:58:50.708 --> 06:58:50.718 align:start position:0%
drive
 
06:58:52.468 --> 06:58:52.478 align:start position:0%
no one's forcing you to install anything
 
06:58:54.468 --> 06:58:54.478 align:start position:0%
you just don't drive if you want to
 
06:58:54.478 --> 06:58:55.350 align:start position:0%
you just don't drive if you want to
drive

06:58:55.350 --> 06:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
drive
 
06:58:57.510 --> 06:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
after having been convicted multiple
 
06:58:59.670 --> 06:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
times or having been convicted double
 
06:59:02.070 --> 06:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
the legal limit you say you know what
 
06:59:03.670 --> 06:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go ahead and enter this
 
06:59:04.948 --> 06:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
agreement with you state of new
 
06:59:07.510 --> 06:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire so that you let me drive
 
06:59:09.110 --> 06:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
then you are going to have to live up to
 
06:59:11.110 --> 06:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
your side of the bargain and it may be
 
06:59:13.910 --> 06:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
costly indeed um and having administered
 
06:59:15.670 --> 06:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
numerous breathalyzers tests i can tell
 
06:59:17.190 --> 06:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
you that the representative is correct
 
06:59:18.230 --> 06:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
you do have to
 
06:59:20.390 --> 06:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
blow into that thing for like 30 seconds
 
06:59:20.400 --> 06:59:21.670 align:start position:0%
blow into that thing for like 30 seconds
so

06:59:21.670 --> 06:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:59:23.590 --> 06:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
there's a cost to be paid but remember
 
06:59:25.910 --> 06:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're not making anybody do anything
 
06:59:27.830 --> 06:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
for the privilege of driving in this
 
06:59:27.840 --> 06:59:28.708 align:start position:0%
for the privilege of driving in this
state

06:59:28.708 --> 06:59:28.718 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:59:30.150 --> 06:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
that they
 
06:59:31.590 --> 06:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
first of all violated the first
 
06:59:32.788 --> 06:59:32.798 align:start position:0%
agreement where they said they wouldn't
 
06:59:34.468 --> 06:59:34.478 align:start position:0%
drink and drive then they did it again
 
06:59:35.990 --> 06:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
and then they did it again
 
06:59:37.430 --> 06:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
the state's still willing to let them
 
06:59:39.190 --> 06:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to drive but now
 
06:59:40.628 --> 06:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very very difficult and
 
06:59:42.070 --> 06:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
if that's a burden on their family they
 
06:59:44.070 --> 06:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
put that burden on their family not the
 
06:59:46.310 --> 06:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire so
 
06:59:48.548 --> 06:59:48.558 align:start position:0%
as far as i'm concerned i think that
 
06:59:50.468 --> 06:59:50.478 align:start position:0%
this this is a good bill and we should
 
06:59:59.110 --> 06:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:03.110 --> 07:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:04.868 --> 07:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of times in this committee we're
 
07:00:07.030 --> 07:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
we're forced to make hard choices
 
07:00:07.040 --> 07:00:08.070 align:start position:0%
we're forced to make hard choices
between

07:00:08.070 --> 07:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
between
 
07:00:10.390 --> 07:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh victims and offenders
 
07:00:13.510 --> 07:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
and to me this is an easy choice
 
07:00:15.910 --> 07:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is we're passing a bill
 
07:00:17.670 --> 07:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
that will result in the creation of
 
07:00:20.948 --> 07:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:22.468 --> 07:00:22.478 align:start position:0%
so i
 
07:00:31.590 --> 07:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:36.230 --> 07:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:38.070 --> 07:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
i don't want anybody to think that my
 
07:00:39.910 --> 07:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
motivation is to
 
07:00:42.150 --> 07:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
harm victims in any way i fully agree
 
07:00:44.628 --> 07:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
with removing the
 
07:00:44.638 --> 07:00:45.510 align:start position:0%
with removing the
the

07:00:45.510 --> 07:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:00:49.270 --> 07:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
stupid ringer on my phone
 
07:00:51.030 --> 07:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
i can't say anything because i
 
07:00:52.948 --> 07:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
violated that rule about 20 minutes ago
 
07:00:54.070 --> 07:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:00:55.990 --> 07:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
i appreciate being in the same boat with
 
07:00:56.000 --> 07:00:59.830 align:start position:0%
i appreciate being in the same boat with
you

07:00:59.830 --> 07:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:02.230 --> 07:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
but i but the thing i am concerned about
 
07:01:04.230 --> 07:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
is i think it's that that one sentence
 
07:01:05.990 --> 07:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
is poorly written i think it could be
 
07:01:07.590 --> 07:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
simply fixed
 
07:01:09.830 --> 07:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
by saying someone who has a requirement
 
07:01:11.990 --> 07:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
to have an interlock device when they
 
07:01:14.310 --> 07:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
drive shall not drive a car without an
 
07:01:16.070 --> 07:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
interlock device
 
07:01:16.080 --> 07:01:17.030 align:start position:0%
interlock device
and

07:01:17.030 --> 07:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:01:18.150 --> 07:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
unless there's some kind of
 
07:01:20.548 --> 07:01:20.558 align:start position:0%
administrative thing that causes them to
 
07:01:23.510 --> 07:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
have to have something installed
 
07:01:25.670 --> 07:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
that that would solve the problem take
 
07:01:27.030 --> 07:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
out the one
 
07:01:29.670 --> 07:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
take out the the loophole and just say
 
07:01:31.670 --> 07:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
if you are required to have an intel
 
07:01:33.910 --> 07:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
have an interlock device
 
07:01:37.190 --> 07:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
you shall be guilty of x when you drive
 
07:01:39.110 --> 07:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
a car without an interlock device and
 
07:01:40.788 --> 07:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
that would allow
 
07:01:42.788 --> 07:01:42.798 align:start position:0%
people not have to get caught up in what
 
07:01:45.750 --> 07:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
i think is catch-22 where the whole we
 
07:01:50.310 --> 07:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:53.030 --> 07:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate that but my point is if
 
07:01:54.788 --> 07:01:54.798 align:start position:0%
you if i
 
07:01:56.150 --> 07:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
put the interlocking device into one
 
07:01:57.350 --> 07:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle and say why don't it's
 
07:01:58.628 --> 07:01:58.638 align:start position:0%
registered my name but i don't drive
 
07:01:59.670 --> 07:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
that one we'll just leave it in my
 
07:01:59.680 --> 07:02:01.990 align:start position:0%
that one we'll just leave it in my
garage

07:02:01.990 --> 07:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
garage
 
07:02:03.510 --> 07:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
i i think it's i think i don't think
 
07:02:05.270 --> 07:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
this it's out of line to have a policy
 
07:02:07.030 --> 07:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
to presume you drive the car registered
 
07:02:09.030 --> 07:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
your name so
 
07:02:10.948 --> 07:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
in that case again if you get caught
 
07:02:13.350 --> 07:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
violating this law and no one was
 
07:02:13.360 --> 07:02:14.468 align:start position:0%
violating this law and no one was
injured

07:02:14.468 --> 07:02:14.478 align:start position:0%
injured
 
07:02:15.750 --> 07:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's the best case
 
07:02:17.430 --> 07:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
scenario but the system
 
07:02:18.708 --> 07:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
has already failed because the idea is
 
07:02:20.788 --> 07:02:20.798 align:start position:0%
for you not to be driving without
 
07:02:22.150 --> 07:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
using the interlocking device in the
 
07:02:24.868 --> 07:02:24.878 align:start position:0%
first place and not only are you there's
 
07:02:27.590 --> 07:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
literally a tool in their possession on
 
07:02:28.948 --> 07:02:28.958 align:start position:0%
their property
 
07:02:30.628 --> 07:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
that will allow them to get around this
 
07:02:31.590 --> 07:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
rule and the only way they're going to
 
07:02:33.910 --> 07:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
get caught would be if they were to get
 
07:02:35.990 --> 07:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
be pulled over
 
07:02:38.628 --> 07:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
so i just my thought is
 
07:02:40.468 --> 07:02:40.478 align:start position:0%
i appreciate what you're saying because
 
07:02:42.390 --> 07:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
but the idea is we don't want that
 
07:02:44.230 --> 07:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
person driving period without exception
 
07:02:44.240 --> 07:02:45.270 align:start position:0%
person driving period without exception
without

07:02:45.270 --> 07:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
without
 
07:02:47.510 --> 07:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
the interlocking device being
 
07:02:47.520 --> 07:02:48.708 align:start position:0%
the interlocking device being
administered

07:02:48.708 --> 07:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
administered
 
07:02:48.718 --> 07:02:49.590 align:start position:0%
administered
so

07:02:49.590 --> 07:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:02:51.510 --> 07:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's the concern i have but i
 
07:02:59.830 --> 07:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:01.270 --> 07:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
you may you may ask a question to
 
07:03:03.430 --> 07:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative wallace and you may
 
07:03:05.750 --> 07:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
answer the question
 
07:03:07.590 --> 07:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
of answering them anyway
 
07:03:07.600 --> 07:03:08.788 align:start position:0%
of answering them anyway
so

07:03:08.788 --> 07:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:03:11.430 --> 07:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
the the brevarizer is the mouthpiece
 
07:03:13.830 --> 07:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
have to be calibrated to the person
 
07:03:15.990 --> 07:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
um no it's actually calibrated to a
 
07:03:18.310 --> 07:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
laboratory standard on a monthly basis
 
07:03:19.910 --> 07:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
um we use
 
07:03:21.350 --> 07:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
07:03:22.708 --> 07:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
it looks like something in the you know
 
07:03:24.628 --> 07:03:24.638 align:start position:0%
in a physics lab this it's it's all
 
07:03:27.030 --> 07:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
right it's calibrated
 
07:03:27.040 --> 07:03:28.070 align:start position:0%
right it's calibrated
because

07:03:28.070 --> 07:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:03:30.070 --> 07:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
point out one more thing
 
07:03:33.190 --> 07:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
yes you're so recognized thank you um
 
07:03:34.468 --> 07:03:34.478 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
07:03:36.788 --> 07:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
who is going to enforce this wall
 
07:03:39.510 --> 07:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
because if it requires
 
07:03:42.150 --> 07:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
interlock devices in all vehicles are
 
07:03:45.430 --> 07:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
they are we going to have an enforcement
 
07:03:45.440 --> 07:03:46.628 align:start position:0%
they are we going to have an enforcement
uh

07:03:46.628 --> 07:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:03:49.430 --> 07:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
agencies yes doing this the service
 
07:03:51.110 --> 07:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
providers we do that
 
07:03:52.628 --> 07:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
okay you're going to go to the household
 
07:03:54.868 --> 07:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
and inspect all vehicles no they have to
 
07:03:56.708 --> 07:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
bring their vehicles in on a monthly
 
07:03:59.190 --> 07:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
basis to have and we look at to make
 
07:04:01.270 --> 07:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
sure that the the connection points to
 
07:04:02.708 --> 07:04:02.718 align:start position:0%
the vehicle's wiring harness are not
 
07:04:03.910 --> 07:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
tampered with
 
07:04:05.590 --> 07:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
we calibrate the machines because the
 
07:04:07.510 --> 07:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
evidence that the breath samples that
 
07:04:09.430 --> 07:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
that device takes
 
07:04:09.440 --> 07:04:10.868 align:start position:0%
that device takes
are

07:04:10.868 --> 07:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
are
 
07:04:12.868 --> 07:04:12.878 align:start position:0%
prima facie evidence can be used in a
 
07:04:14.948 --> 07:04:14.958 align:start position:0%
court and they can convict you as a
 
07:04:17.350 --> 07:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
with of an oui from the data dump from
 
07:04:18.948 --> 07:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
that device that's why we calibrate it
 
07:04:18.958 --> 07:04:19.910 align:start position:0%
that device that's why we calibrate it
monthly

07:04:19.910 --> 07:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
monthly
 
07:04:22.230 --> 07:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
to a laboratory standard not to the
 
07:04:22.240 --> 07:04:26.948 align:start position:0%
to a laboratory standard not to the
individual

07:04:26.948 --> 07:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:29.270 --> 07:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
right this time we'll now move when i'll

by uh
 
07:06:01.830 --> 07:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
the most about to pass
 
07:06:08.468 --> 07:06:08.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:11.590 --> 07:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:13.830 --> 07:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
will it be a majority report
 
07:06:16.070 --> 07:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
and i made them
 
07:06:17.510 --> 07:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
whoever uh
 
07:06:19.510 --> 07:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
just to point out
 
07:06:23.350 --> 07:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
this was hb 1465 last year i bet there's
 
07:06:25.750 --> 07:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
a very good uh majority report
 
07:06:30.070 --> 07:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:34.070 --> 07:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
1465 was the same bill last term
 
07:06:35.990 --> 07:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
from that's what uh i have my notes from
 
07:06:36.000 --> 07:06:37.910 align:start position:0%
from that's what uh i have my notes from
the

07:06:37.910 --> 07:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:06:40.390 --> 07:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible but noon noon time
 
07:06:40.400 --> 07:06:48.230 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible but noon noon time
tomorrow

07:06:48.230 --> 07:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:49.670 --> 07:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
so this time we'll now close the
 
07:06:52.548 --> 07:06:52.558 align:start position:0%
executive session on hb
 
07:06:52.558 --> 07:06:54.070 align:start position:0%
executive session on hb
1085.

07:06:54.070 --> 07:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
1085.
 
07:06:55.590 --> 07:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
we will not be executing anything else
 
07:06:57.270 --> 07:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
today just one
 
07:06:58.628 --> 07:06:58.638 align:start position:0%
just one
 
07:06:59.990 --> 07:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
bill that was
 
07:07:03.110 --> 07:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
hb 349.
 
07:07:04.948 --> 07:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
was a bill that we passed in the house
 
07:07:04.958 --> 07:07:06.628 align:start position:0%
was a bill that we passed in the house
last

07:07:06.628 --> 07:07:06.638 align:start position:0%
last
 
07:07:07.910 --> 07:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
last year
 
07:07:09.830 --> 07:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
it was i don't know the proper term but
 
07:07:10.628 --> 07:07:10.638 align:start position:0%
it was
 
07:07:12.310 --> 07:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
their version of retained in the other
 
07:07:12.320 --> 07:07:13.830 align:start position:0%
their version of retained in the other
body

07:07:13.830 --> 07:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
body
 
07:07:15.750 --> 07:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
re-refer i think they what they use
 
07:07:18.390 --> 07:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
anyway they there was a senate they
 
07:07:20.150 --> 07:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
amended that bill all they amended was
 
07:07:21.670 --> 07:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
the effective date
 
07:07:23.190 --> 07:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
and that was the bill
 
07:07:24.868 --> 07:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
that would if you were driving with a
 
07:07:26.708 --> 07:07:26.718 align:start position:0%
suspended license
 
07:07:28.468 --> 07:07:28.478 align:start position:0%
it would allow you to you to take in
 
07:07:30.468 --> 07:07:30.478 align:start position:0%
consideration out-of-state convictions
 
07:07:32.070 --> 07:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
that were
 
07:07:34.310 --> 07:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
of similar in nature so i was going to
 
07:07:36.788 --> 07:07:36.798 align:start position:0%
make a motion to concur with the senate
 
07:07:38.150 --> 07:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
amendment it just simply changed the
 
07:07:40.788 --> 07:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:43.830 --> 07:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions on that bill
 
07:07:47.190 --> 07:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:47.200 --> 07:07:49.430 align:start position:0%
 
see

07:07:49.430 --> 07:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:52.708 --> 07:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
it's it's hb 349. we passed in the house
 
07:07:54.150 --> 07:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
last year
 
07:07:55.990 --> 07:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh it would it
 
07:07:57.830 --> 07:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
it was
 
07:07:59.270 --> 07:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
i think the term is re-referred but it
 
07:08:01.030 --> 07:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
was the the senate version of retaining
 
07:08:02.230 --> 07:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
07:08:04.230 --> 07:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
it was retained in committee the the
 
07:08:05.990 --> 07:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
amendment all it does is change the
 
07:08:08.150 --> 07:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
effective date it doesn't change any of
 
07:08:11.590 --> 07:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
the actual subject matter of the bill
 
07:08:11.600 --> 07:08:13.430 align:start position:0%
the actual subject matter of the bill
uh

07:08:13.430 --> 07:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:08:15.350 --> 07:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm i was going to make a
 
07:08:17.350 --> 07:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
recommend a motion to concur with the
 
07:08:19.990 --> 07:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
senate amendment on hb349
 
07:08:21.350 --> 07:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
and does anyone have any questions on
 
07:08:21.360 --> 07:08:23.510 align:start position:0%
and does anyone have any questions on

07:08:30.150 --> 07:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:32.868 --> 07:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
if i recall i i want to i'm going off
 
07:08:34.788 --> 07:08:34.798 align:start position:0%

07:08:36.390 --> 07:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
committee i
 
07:08:39.670 --> 07:08:39.680 align:start position:0%

07:08:41.510 --> 07:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't remember of the problem
 
07:08:43.430 --> 07:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
i would have to check
 
07:08:49.430 --> 07:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:51.430 --> 07:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
at this time the the committee the
 
07:08:53.190 --> 07:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
