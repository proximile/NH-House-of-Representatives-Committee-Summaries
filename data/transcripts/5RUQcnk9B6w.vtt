and

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
I understand that there may be
 
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
amendments that we made to that today
 
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
and if you are intending to make an
 
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
amendment you should make that known at
 
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
I'd note that there was an amendment
 
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
that was sent around by representative
 
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
Birch specifically an amendment to add
 
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
on uh some language I reviewed that and
 
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
indicated that I found that non-germaine
 
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
and the only way uh and that's pursuant
 
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
to house rule 46b
 
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
and the only way that that can be heard
 
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
and included as an amendment is if
 
00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 align:start position:0%
they're the committee were to decide to
 
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
hold a separate hearing on that
 
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.610 align:start position:0%
hold a separate hearing on that
Amendment

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
and so uh if uh if representative Birch
 
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to move to hold a hearing I would
 
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
schedule that hearing for next week when
 
00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 align:start position:0%
we're scheduled to exec Senate bill 96.
 
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 align:start position:0%

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and I first want

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
life for everyone go a little bit
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
smoother uh when we know some of these
 
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
things in advance so I appreciate the
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
the courtesy extended to me and the
 
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.790 align:start position:0%
the courtesy extended to me and the
committee

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 align:start position:0%
on this uh if I understand correctly uh
 
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
with a vote of the committee uh we would
 
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
take this matter up
 
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
um in here in a public hearing a week
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
from now I uh have no objection to that
 
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
I would support this as a method of
 
00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
moving forward I I would I don't know if
 
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
the it's necessary for me to move the
 
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
amendment now
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
uh if uh I see uh our clerk saying no uh
 
00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:19.259 align:start position:0%
but uh nice looks like our chair is
 
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
saying no so I won't move the amendment
 
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.010 align:start position:0%
saying no so I won't move the amendment
now

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
what what I think I think what you need
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
to do is have a motion to hold a hearing
 
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
on your Amendment uh all right and then
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
uh we can determine whether or not the
 
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0%
committee is in agreement with that all
 
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
right and ISO move that we have a public
 
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
hearing uh on Amendment one two four
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
four h
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
um I would indicate just briefly that
 
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
the reason I filed it in advance of this
 
00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:55.259 align:start position:0%
hearing and not at the exact session uh
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
was to have a public hearing so I'm all
 
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
in favor of this motion passing and if
 
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
it does pass I have one question from
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
the chair and that is there are a number
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
of people lined up uh expecting to
 
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:13.220 align:start position:0%
testify today
 
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh in public hearing uh I don't know if
 
00:08:19.969 --> 00:08:19.979 align:start position:0%
this passes whether it would be the
 
00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:22.979 align:start position:0%
chair's position to take those people
 
00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
today and still have the remainder in a
 
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
week or do it all in a week's time and
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
free up those today to leave if they
 
00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
wish well I think uh first of all is
 
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
there a second to uh representative
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
Birch's motion
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
my second
 
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
I think I saw a hand from representative
 
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
Macbeth first so she'll second the
 
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
motion and to answer your question uh I
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
have the same concern that you have is
 
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
that people will testify to your
 
00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
Amendment today and then we're going to
 
00:08:59.810 --> 00:08:59.820 align:start position:0%
hold a hearing next week and then they
 
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
come back and testify all over again a
 
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
second time we really don't need to do
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
that so I guess what I I would say is if
 
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
people have made the effort to be here
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
today and want to testify on your
 
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:16.740 align:start position:0%
Amendment they should do so but not
 
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
expect to come back and testify next
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
week and give us the same testimony
 
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
again next week so I'll give them their
 
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
choice as to whether or not they want to
 
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
testify today or next week if that makes
 
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.889 align:start position:0%
testify today or next week if that makes
sense

00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:27.899 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
that only leaves me the remaining
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
questions then do do I have to put the
 
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:34.860 align:start position:0%
amendment on the table so to speak
 
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:37.700 align:start position:0%
for people to discuss
 
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.610 align:start position:0%
for people to discuss
ion

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:39.620 align:start position:0%
ion
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I think
 
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.910 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I think
before

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
I uh
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
I I don't think you need to do that I
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
think they can speak to the amendment uh
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
I think we all have a sense of what the
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
amendment is uh although I know you've
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
made some changes to what was uh 111. so
 
00:10:04.009 --> 00:10:04.019 align:start position:0%
I think we're all set
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
thank you yes so Mr chairman Mike
 
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
I have some difficulties with this
 
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
we're required to in order to adopt the
 
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
non-germaine family we're required to
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
have separately noticed public here
 
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
that's correct so we'll we'll have to
 
00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:26.339 align:start position:0%
have a hearing next week
 
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
no matter how much testimony we take for
 
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
that and I will
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
say that there may be a lot of people
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
who don't know about this amendment
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
who might want to testify
 
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
all right I have no way to know it but
 
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
it's just a normal course of action
 
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
that's why we notice me
 
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.630 align:start position:0%
that's why we notice me
so

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.490 align:start position:0%
so
yeah

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative rice I think that if
 
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.269 align:start position:0%
yes representative rice I think that if
we

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
um have the people who want to testify
 
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
on this amendment testify next week and
 
00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
get it all in one lump sum there'll be a
 
00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:02.459 align:start position:0%
lot less repetitive testimony
 
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
um I think our questions we won't be
 
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
asking to duplicating questions I just
 
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
think it's better to keep it all
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
I think uh representative Birch what I
 
00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:23.339 align:start position:0%
what I've just heard is people would
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
prefer to have the testimony next week
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
as opposed to have people testify today
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
even though
 
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:31.019 align:start position:0%
I understand that some people may have
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
come today specifically to do so they
 
00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:35.459 align:start position:0%
may not be available next week
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
I guess if they weren't going to be
 
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
available next week then I wouldn't want
 
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.430 align:start position:0%
available next week then I wouldn't want
to

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
prohibit them from giving their
 
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.190 align:start position:0%
prohibit them from giving their
testimony

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
all right thank you and I appreciate
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
everyone's uh consideration I as a
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
matter of of uh believe I I encourage
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
public participation in our uh
 
00:11:59.630 --> 00:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
proceedings I I let people know as soon
 
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:02.220 align:start position:0%
as I heard from the chair that it was
 
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
possible that we would not be proceeding
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
with with testimony today so
 
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
um if it's a matter of rescheduling all
 
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
of them for next week
 
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
um I can live with that with the
 
00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:17.220 align:start position:0%
understanding that if some of these
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
individuals cannot make it next week
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
they have a week to submit
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
um and their testimony in writing if
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
they wish
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's my intention to act on
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 96 next week with with all
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
amendments so I don't think we would be
 
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
looking for an additional week but they
 
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
do have a week to test they do have a
 
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
week to submit their testimony this week
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's what I meant uh
 
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
if I wasn't clear
 
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:52.740 align:start position:0%

so by about eight
 
00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
voting eleven to eight uh I will arrange
 
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.220 align:start position:0%

I was asked by then attorney general
 
00:15:52.339 --> 00:15:54.069 align:start position:0%
I was asked by then attorney general
McDonald

00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
McDonald
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
and then Governor's legal counsel John
 
00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
fermella both of whom have
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
been elevated in positions
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
in December to file Senate Bill 96 as a
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
result of the unanimous recommendations
 
00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:17.459 align:start position:0%
of the governor's liact Commission
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman as you know
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
a number of the recommendations of the
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
liac commission
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
are in the process of being implemented
 
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh through executive order at the
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
present time
 
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
what Senate Bill 96 seeks to do
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
is to put into law those
 
00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:44.339 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the liac commission
 
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
that needed a change in law to implement
 
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:51.380 align:start position:0%
so not all of the 40 plus
 
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the liac commission
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
are included in Senate Bill 96 but many
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
of them are
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
this Bill had broad support in the
 
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
Senate there was some discussion about
 
00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:10.100 align:start position:0%
the voluntary information
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
on driver's licenses which was turned
 
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
into a study committee but with the
 
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
exception of that one discussion in the
 
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
Senate it was adopted on a bipartisan
 
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.339 align:start position:0%
basis in fact the vote Mr chairman was
 
00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:29.990 align:start position:0%
basis in fact the vote Mr chairman was
unanimous

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
I want to um at this point thank all of
 
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:38.100 align:start position:0%

body cameras another recommendation of
 
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
the liac commission
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill deals with the
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
retention of records that should be kept
 
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
for a 20-year period of time except for
 
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
the exceptions that are outlined in the
 
00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:21.419 align:start position:0%
bill the third section of the bill Mr
 
00:18:21.419 --> 00:18:23.029 align:start position:0%
bill the third section of the bill Mr
chairman

00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
um calls for any memorandum of
 
00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:30.500 align:start position:0%
understanding between a police
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
chief and school resource officers to be
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
made available to the public as a public
 
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.010 align:start position:0%
made available to the public as a public
document

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:39.020 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
sections four
 
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.370 align:start position:0%
sections four
five

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:45.260 align:start position:0%
four and five
 
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
deal with a body worn camera fund I
 
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
think increasingly in our state and
 
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
Nation we are realizing the body worn
 
00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.669 align:start position:0%
Nation we are realizing the body worn
cameras

00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
are a very very good idea to understand
 
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
exactly what has happened in some of the
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances that we have seen
 
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
um in our state and in other states in
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
section five uh the sum of a dollar is
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated in this bill I think Mr
 
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
chairman as you know in House Bill 2
 
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
the house passed a one million dollar
 
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.529 align:start position:0%
the house passed a one million dollar
appropriation

00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:24.539 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
um for body worn cameras
 
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
um section six and seven deal with
 
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
delinquent delinquent children
 
00:19:39.049 --> 00:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
and um the new section is the language
 
00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:42.539 align:start position:0%
that about no person under 13 shall be
 
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
subject to proceedings
 
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
Section 8 as I mentioned in the opening
 
00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.590 align:start position:0%
Section 8 as I mentioned in the opening
replaces

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
replaces
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
voluntary inclusion of information on
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
race and ethnic
 
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
data on driver's licenses
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
there was a major concern in the senate
 
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
about even though it was voluntary in
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
nature if it ever became mandatory it
 
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
would be akin to racial profiling so the
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
Senate deemed it worthy of a study
 
00:20:23.409 --> 00:20:23.419 align:start position:0%
committee to examine the issue further
 
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
lastly section 9 talks about
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
in the judicial system
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
judges and justices receiving implicit
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
bias training and racial profiling
 
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.570 align:start position:0%
bias training and racial profiling
training

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
so those are the sections of the bill
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
I just want to comment if I could Mr
 
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
chairman and
 
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
um it's not my place to
 
00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
um talk about your procedures in the
 
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
house and I don't want this interpreted
 
00:21:00.289 --> 00:21:00.299 align:start position:0%
as doing so however
 
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
as I think of where we are on May 11th
 
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
you would have a public hearing
 
00:21:11.049 --> 00:21:11.059 align:start position:0%
on this bill next week on
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
the qualified immunity amendment that
 
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:17.900 align:start position:0%
the house previously defeated and then
 
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
presumably vote in the first week of
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
June the Senate would be in a very
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
difficult position Mr chairman of not
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
having had an opportunity to have a
 
00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
on an issue that
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
I think whether you agree with the
 
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
language in the amendment or don't agree
 
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
with the language in the amendment
 
00:21:45.049 --> 00:21:45.059 align:start position:0%
senators are going to want to consider
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
that as they consider the bill
 
00:21:51.529 --> 00:21:51.539 align:start position:0%
the inability to do that and have a
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
public Hearing in the Senate
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
would be extraordinarily problematic Mr
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
chairman so I'll leave it at that and
 
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
let that be part of your consideration
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
as you take the actions that you deem
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
necessary to take on Senate bill 96.
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%

00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at the bill and just
 
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
trying to match up the amended analysis
 
00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:18.539 align:start position:0%
on the first page with the rest and I
 
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
can't seem to match it up is that a me
 
00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
problem or is that um
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
a larger problem that people are having
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just paying attention to the bill
 
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
but I'm wondering if I should
 
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
try to square any of that language
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
with the parts of the bill that Senator
 
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
I think we're all having the same
 
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
problem and that uh the amended analysis
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
shows six parts but the bill itself
 
00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:48.950 align:start position:0%
shows six parts but the bill itself
uh

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
chose 10 actually with the effective
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
date portion 10 parts so uh it's a bit
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
confusing Mr chairman if I might
 
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
um for instance six and seven the
 
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
section dealing with delinquent children
 
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's Roman 4 in the amended analysis
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
there are two sections there uh section
 
00:24:10.559 --> 00:24:12.169 align:start position:0%
there are two sections there uh section
one

00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh four and five deal with a body worn
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
camera fund
 
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.909 align:start position:0%
camera fund
and

00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
that is Roman three in the amended
 
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
analysis I believe that all of the
 
00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.950 align:start position:0%
analysis I believe that all of the
sections

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
sections
 
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
are correctly noted in the amended
 
00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.230 align:start position:0%
are correctly noted in the amended
analysis

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
um but just if if you would just please
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
remember that in the amended analysis it
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
covers in a couple of those Provisions
 
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
that I just cited more than one section
 
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.870 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you for your testimony
 
00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.470 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you for your testimony
today

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:09.059 --> 00:25:10.669 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
the next speaker would be uh
 
00:25:27.409 --> 00:25:27.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman I was going to
 
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
be providing information on the proposed
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
amendment so I will hold off to next
 
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.310 align:start position:0%
amendment so I will hold off to next
week

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
Joseph uh
 
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
Joseph uh
pobeki

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:44.450 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:51.909 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
can you hear me uh Mr chairman we can
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
hear you fine
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
all right excellent good morning uh
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
chairman Gordon members of the committee
 
00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
my name is Joe hobeki
 
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm the chief of police in Hollis
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm also the first vice
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
president for the New Hampshire
 
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
Association of chiefs of police
 
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
and I've been in law enforcement for a
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
little over 20 years and although I'm
 
00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
not originally from the state of New
 
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm certainly proud to call
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire my home
 
00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.490 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire my home
um

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
so I registered today as neutral on this
 
00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:27.059 align:start position:0%
bill because I anticipated that there
 
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
would be uh we would be speaking to the
 
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
amendment on qualified immunity so I'll
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
reserve my comments for that and I think
 
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
you probably uh
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
know how I stand on that portion of the
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
amendment but I will certainly be back
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
next week to testify in opposition to
 
00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
that but I do support the current uh
 
00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
Provisions within Senate Bill 96 I was
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh both honored and very fortunate to
 
00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:54.980 align:start position:0%
serve on the legislative work group
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
for this bill with various other
 
00:26:59.570 --> 00:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to develop language
 
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
relative to uh you know training for
 
00:27:05.049 --> 00:27:05.059 align:start position:0%
judges body worn camera
 
00:27:08.409 --> 00:27:08.419 align:start position:0%
systems juvenile delinquency hearings
 
00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
memorandums of understanding for a
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
school resource officers and then data
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
collection relative to dermographics on
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
police citizen contacts
 
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
um although the bill before you is a A
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
variation of the uh the original
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
legislation as is is common uh I
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
certainly do support the language
 
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
contained within I did however uh wish
 
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
to mention that this amended version of
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
the bill is absent language uh relative
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
to collection of demographic information
 
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:45.299 align:start position:0%
with police and citizen encounters
 
00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
um given the recommendation of the liac
 
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
commission from uh this past summer uh I
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
do feel as though this is an important
 
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
and appropriate piece within the bill
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
and although I understand the concerns
 
00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:00.419 align:start position:0%
expressed by the Senate on adding race
 
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
and ethnicity to a person's driver's
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
license uh I still feel as though the
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
collection of such demographic uh
 
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.350 align:start position:0%
collection of such demographic uh
information

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
um uh is important and it also conforms
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
with leak recommendation
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
it is however uh important to note that
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
there are limitations when collecting
 
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
this data given the varying capability
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
as a police records Management systems
 
00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
and for the sake of time uh I won't
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
speak to that but I'd be certainly
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
willing to discuss this in these issues
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
with members of the committee at a later
 
00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:39.299 align:start position:0%
time if if it's deemed appropriate so in
 
00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
closing I support the bill
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
and I continue to work with the various
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to ensure that New
 
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement continues to
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
meet the demands of policing in the 21st
 
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.610 align:start position:0%
meet the demands of policing in the 21st
century

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
century
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
while setting the highest standard for
 
00:28:54.409 --> 00:28:54.419 align:start position:0%
other states to follow so I thank you
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
very much chairman Gordon members of the
 
00:28:57.169 --> 00:28:57.179 align:start position:0%
committee for your time and
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
consideration be happy to answer any
 
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
questions you might have
 
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
yes representative McLean thank you Mr
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
question I just have a quick question
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
um because it is more a question of
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
familiarity on my part
 
00:29:15.649 --> 00:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
um the memorandum of intent
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
um uh between uh the schools and the law
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement what typically is in that
 
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
just for my education purposes
 
00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
representative there is a law contained
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
within that
 
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.269 align:start position:0%
within that
um

00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
a quick kind of
 
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
I guess uh Cliff Notes version of what's
 
00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
contained with an rmou is you know it
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
sets provisions on the responsibility of
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
a school resource officer
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
um it can get as finite as stipulating
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
that they'll be provided with office
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
space what the expectations of their
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
service hours to the school enrolls and
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility within School discipline
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
and such are I'd be happy to share with
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
you and members of the committee a link
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
to our current mou which is right on our
 
00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:07.559 align:start position:0%
website it's a public document for
 
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
everyone to see
 
00:30:12.889 --> 00:30:12.899 align:start position:0%
for your review it's by no means you
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
know a template for other agencies or
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
other towns to follow but I think we're
 
00:30:21.289 --> 00:30:21.299 align:start position:0%
certainly proud of that mou I I believe
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
it is it was used as a framework for the
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
model mou which is currently published
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
on the police standards and training
 
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:34.130 align:start position:0%
on the police standards and training

signed up in support of Senate Bill 96.
 
00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
there were 12 people who signed up in
 
00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.110 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman and members of the committee
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
my name is yield Bissonnet I'm the legal
 
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:31.460 align:start position:0%
director for the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
we strongly support SB 96
 
00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
and really want to Echo some of the
 
00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
things that that chief o Becky just said
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
in his testimony this is really
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
consensus legislation where all
 
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholders got together and met for
 
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
months over last summer to discuss what
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
policies we could agree to as a state
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
that would help Foster trust between the
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
police and the communities they serve
 
00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
and this included state and local law
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement police unions the NAACP the
 
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
ACLU and others and in the testimony
 
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
that I circulated to the committee
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
yesterday evening I footnoted the liact
 
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
commission report in that testimony and
 
00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
I would certainly encourage folks in the
 
00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
community to if they haven't already to
 
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
to take a look at that it's I think in
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
excess of 100 pages and really
 
00:32:27.169 --> 00:32:27.179 align:start position:0%
was the product of hundreds of hours at
 
00:32:27.179 --> 00:32:28.430 align:start position:0%
was the product of hundreds of hours at
work

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
um among key stakeholders in the state
 
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:31.740 align:start position:0%
and I could tell you from the ACLU
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
perspective we were really proud to I've
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
been a part of that process and the
 
00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:39.539 align:start position:0%
result of that really is what's in the
 
00:32:42.169 --> 00:32:42.179 align:start position:0%
bill presented before you
 
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
um there's one issue that I want to
 
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
raise and it was it was addressed both
 
00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:48.779 align:start position:0%
by chief o Becky and Senator Bradley and
 
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
that's with respect to the data
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
collection component we do support an
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to SB 96 I circulated that
 
00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment to the committee
 
00:32:58.970 --> 00:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
yesterday evening this amendment would
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
add back into the bill the language
 
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
recommended by the liac commission and
 
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
that was in the original bill that would
 
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
require the collection of racial data in
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
law enforcement stops of course the
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
inclusion of that information on the
 
00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:13.559 align:start position:0%
driver's license is optional that's left
 
00:33:15.409 --> 00:33:15.419 align:start position:0%
to the individual when they're filling
 
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
out the driver's license application and
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
this was as I said removed by the Senate
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
and we think this language is critical
 
00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:24.299 align:start position:0%
and stakeholders and law enforcement
 
00:33:27.529 --> 00:33:27.539 align:start position:0%
groups supported this policy as a way to
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
further Foster trust between the
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
community and law enforcement and we do
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
not necessarily in our view the aclu's
 
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
view see a need for a further study
 
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
Commission on this issue which is
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
reflected in the current bill I believe
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
it's section eight and that's because we
 
00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:48.539 align:start position:0%
already studied it and then we have
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
commission studied this uh extensively
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
and I could say too that the police
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
Chiefs Association as well provided
 
00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
tremendous leadership and feedback in
 
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:01.140 align:start position:0%
coming up with language that was
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
feasible and that language is reflected
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
in the amendment that I proposed last
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
night and with the collection of this
 
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
data we can learn whether we you know
 
00:34:11.329 --> 00:34:11.339 align:start position:0%
have racial disparities in policing in
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or whether we don't and if
 
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
we have this issue then we can work on
 
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
as a state taking proactive steps to
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
address it and I would also note that
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
many police departments actually in New
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire actually already correct
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
collect this data under the Kalia
 
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
certification so we know that this is
 
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
feasible and as I said before the
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
language that's proposed in my memetus
 
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
language that was drafted not only by
 
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
the clu but with the help of uh and
 
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
feedback of the chiefs of police in the
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
AG's office to make sure that we're
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
doing this in a way that's feasible for
 
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
law enforcement who have to do this
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
um you know in the in the trenches of
 
00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:50.940 align:start position:0%
the system and we really do want to make
 
00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:51.899 align:start position:0%
sure that this is something that's
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
practical and workable and I'm very
 
00:34:55.849 --> 00:34:55.859 align:start position:0%
confident that the language that we came
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
up with and that's reflected in our
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh accomplishes that and so
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
with that I'll conclude my testimony
 
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the committee's
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%

00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:10.859 align:start position:0%

of the committee my name is Will Stewart
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of stay work
 
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
play New Hampshire which is a Statewide
 
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
nonprofit whose mission is to attract
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
and retain more young people here in the
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
granite state and I'm here today to
 
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of Senate Bill 96.
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
attracting and retaining more young
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
people is critical to the future of New
 
00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are as you may know the
 
00:36:17.089 --> 00:36:17.099 align:start position:0%
second oldest state in the country with
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
one of the lowest unemployment rates and
 
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
on top of this we're the number one
 
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
exporter of high school graduates
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
seeking a four-year degree with 62
 
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
percent of these young people leaving
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
the state every year some of them come
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
back but a lot of them don't
 
00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
in short New Hampshire needs all the
 
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
people we can get in general and all the
 
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
young people we can get in particular
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
our businesses need workers and
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
customers our towns need volunteer board
 
00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:41.099 align:start position:0%
members and our non-profits churches and
 
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
Civic clubs all need volunteers to
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
accomplish their vital missions without
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
which our communities just can't
 
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.810 align:start position:0%
which our communities just can't
function

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:36:50.089 --> 00:36:50.099 align:start position:0%
so about three years ago State work play
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
commissioned a survey to collect data on
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
why young people stay in and might leave
 
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and one of the reasons uh
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
we found that young people might leave
 
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
is due to our state's lack of diversity
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
we heard this over and over again also
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
last fall and winter as we talked to
 
00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
young people in nine locations across
 
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
the state as part of our policy and pint
 
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
series and indeed New Hampshire's lack
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
of diversity was a top three reason
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
cited for young people potentially
 
00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
leaving the state
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
so as a result of these findings
 
00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
increasing diversity equity and
 
00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
inclusion here in New Hampshire has
 
00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
become a policy priority for statework
 
00:37:23.089 --> 00:37:23.099 align:start position:0%
play and it's for this reason that we
 
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
support SB 96 and bipartisan bill that
 
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
seeks to increase trust in the judicial
 
00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:29.579 align:start position:0%
system as a whole and with law
 
00:37:31.609 --> 00:37:31.619 align:start position:0%
enforcement in particular and both of
 
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
these are necessary if we want to
 
00:37:35.329 --> 00:37:35.339 align:start position:0%
attract and retain more people of color
 
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your attention and for
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
your consideration in supporting Senate
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill 96.
 
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
any questions for Mr Stewart all right
 
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.290 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
I is it you're assertion that by just
 
00:37:59.210 --> 00:37:59.220 align:start position:0%
collecting this data
 
00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:02.220 align:start position:0%
somehow that's going to attract more
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
people of color into our state is that
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:08.339 align:start position:0%
well I'm saying that uh you know I think
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
the recommendations in this bill you
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
know aim to again to increase trust uh
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement and the judicial
 
00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
system you know as a whole it's it's one
 
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
piece of uh of doing that and I think
 
00:38:22.849 --> 00:38:22.859 align:start position:0%
that increasing trust again in the
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
judicial system and law enforcement in
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
particular that is is key to uh you know
 
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
not just attraction but uh you know
 
00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
perhaps more the retention of um of
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Alexander um thank
 
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you uh Mr Stewart for
 
00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
taking that question
 
00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
um there may be proposed amendment or
 
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a public next week
 
00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:50.339 align:start position:0%
um the statework plan on testifying or
 
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
what would be stay replaced position on
 
00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.150 align:start position:0%
what would be stay replaced position on
that

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:56.220 align:start position:0%
with regard to the qualified immunity
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes sir
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
uh at present uh we do not have an
 
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
opinion on that as our our board of
 
00:39:05.089 --> 00:39:05.099 align:start position:0%
directors has not uh and our advocacy
 
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
committee have not discussed that uh
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
particular piece uh at present so uh no
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh no opinion right now
 
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
thank you May and I ask a point of order
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
of the chair yes you may
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
um is it uh going to be allowed to ask
 
00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:25.980 align:start position:0%
questions because I certainly would have
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
asked the sponsor the bill some
 
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
questions about uh what he said on
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity
 
00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
I think our intention was that we
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get into uh your Amendment
 
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
today so I apologize for the pity thank
 
00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.030 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire Police Association I've
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
been in law enforcement in New Hampshire
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
for over 22 years and uh I was proud to
 
00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
be selected to serve on Governors in new
 
00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
zliac Commission
 
00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
the work this commission accomplished
 
00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
was something that only happened because
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
of the dedication of those involved and
 
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:47.220 align:start position:0%
the ability to actually listen and not
 
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
talk at one another New Hampshire has
 
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
set the bar for other states and that we
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
came together collectively to discuss
 
00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
and and listen
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
we came up with recommendations that
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
have been acted on in totality
 
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
you know all 48 recommendations have
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
been acted on this lets this legislation
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
actually represents some of those
 
00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.589 align:start position:0%
actually represents some of those
recommendations

00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:41:09.599 --> 00:41:10.370 align:start position:0%
recommendations
um

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
to include you know the totality of
 
00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
those 48.
 
00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
I had planned to testify simply in
 
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
support of this legislation today and
 
00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
only highlight how this type of
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislation can be accomplished in New
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when folks demonstrate
 
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.450 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when folks demonstrate
cooperation

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
cooperation
 
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:28.740 align:start position:0%
teamwork and compromise
 
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
we now have grave concerns about any
 
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
amendments that may be added to the
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
legislation at the last minute that
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
could really jeopardize the success of
 
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
this or any other legislation the
 
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
recommendations found in this bill are
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
are really too valuable to risk the
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
failure of the entire bill
 
00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
um and I'll reserve my right to testify
 
00:41:53.329 --> 00:41:53.339 align:start position:0%
in the amendment next week of course
 
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
um and I'll simply say that the New
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Police Association supports
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
the recommendations put forward from
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
leac and supports this legislation
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
to briefly speak to attorney bissonnet's
 
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
testimony you know we also agree that
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
data collection is very important and I
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
believe the reason there is support for
 
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
data collection from New Hampshire law
 
00:42:17.089 --> 00:42:17.099 align:start position:0%
enforcement is because we do not have a
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
problem with disparaging treatment of
 
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
minorities in our statistics can be used
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate that
 
00:42:26.569 --> 00:42:26.579 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire law enforcement really
 
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
Prides itself in doing a good job here
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
for the citizens of the state
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
um and any opportunity we have to
 
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that we obviously are for
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
so I won't take up any more of your time
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
and I will simply say in this current
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
form uh we are in support of SB 96
 
00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:49.820 align:start position:0%
um I hope that doesn't change
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
but other than that I will gladly take
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
any questions you have thank you very
 
00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
much representative McLean thank you Mr
 
00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:59.270 align:start position:0%
much representative McLean thank you Mr
chairman

00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
um this this might have been a question
 
00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
for for Senator Bradley because it flew
 
00:43:08.329 --> 00:43:08.339 align:start position:0%
through a lot of the bill broadly
 
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
speaking but by understanding that the
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
initial react recommendations had the
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
Gathering of the data but then it went
 
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
to a study committee in the modified
 
00:43:20.329 --> 00:43:20.339 align:start position:0%
version of the Senate bill
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of the decision making
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
what were the concerns that drove it in
 
00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
that direction
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
um as I said Senator Bradley may have
 
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
mentioned the reasoning behind it by the
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
do you just refreshed me on why that was
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful
 
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
I I caught most of that
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I apologize it was a little hard to
 
00:43:41.569 --> 00:43:41.579 align:start position:0%
hear but did you did you say there were
 
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
you're you're asking about
 
00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
um mistakes made in in a recommendation
 
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
no no um it's my understanding that the
 
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
original liac recommendations had the
 
00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:54.839 align:start position:0%
Gathering of this data but that the
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
Senate amended it to go to a study
 
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
committee and so this may have been a
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
question for Senator Bradley but are you
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
aware of the concerns that were raised
 
00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
that moved the Senate to take it and put
 
00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
it into a study committee as opposed to
 
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
leaving it in in its original
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
recommended form
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
well I certainly think that that would
 
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
be a question for Senator Bradley
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
um representative McLean I'll try to
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
answer at least in part and and I think
 
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
even the study committee is still uh
 
00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
conceptually in support of the
 
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation it wasn't a
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
um denial of of the recommendation and I
 
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
think uh there was some you know
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
important topics brought up that
 
00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:44.180 align:start position:0%
you know maybe need to be
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
spoken of a little bit more in depth
 
00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
more in detail but for the most part the
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
um our support for that recommendation
 
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.770 align:start position:0%
um our support for that recommendation
is

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
is pretty basic you know we we support
 
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
the ability
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
um you know of law enforcement to to
 
00:45:04.609 --> 00:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
present you know statistical data uh but
 
00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
how that gets there
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
um you know certainly
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know the Senate has has some
 
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
concerns they'd like to address so I I
 
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
won't speak to their process simply the
 
00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:20.060 align:start position:0%
our support for that recommendation
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.089 --> 00:45:29.099 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today thank
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%

know

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:03.780 align:start position:0%

much
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
um and good morning to the Judiciary
 
00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
Committee I appreciate the opportunity
 
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
to continue to provide full-throated
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
testimony for SB 96
 
00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
um as it stands currently with no
 
00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
additional amendments and I will also
 
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
Echo the statements made by previous
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
participants who have given very
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
supportive testimony over a wide range
 
00:46:43.569 --> 00:46:43.579 align:start position:0%
of topics relative to the contents of
 
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:47.220 align:start position:0%
sb96 there are two small disappointments
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
which is the removing of the collection
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
of data and moving that to a study
 
00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
committee I think
 
00:46:55.319 --> 00:46:55.970 align:start position:0%
committee I think
um

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
attorney Bissonnet so eloquently stated
 
00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.809 align:start position:0%
attorney Bissonnet so eloquently stated
that

00:46:59.809 --> 00:46:59.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
um the entire Lee act commission was a
 
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
study committee of sorts and we put in
 
00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
the work and the hours listened to
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
testimony discussed debated and work
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
together cohesively to create the
 
00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
recommendation to enhance the data
 
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
collection that law enforcement is
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
already doing to allow them to do it
 
00:47:23.809 --> 00:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
more accurately at current my
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is there are there are
 
00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
times where they have to guess and with
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
our beautiful Multicultural Society that
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
we live in I would I would hate to think
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
that someone who's not me has to guess
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
who I am and put that down in in their
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
data collection without having a
 
00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
conversation with me about it or if I'm
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
upset and they have a conversation with
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
me and I withhold that information then
 
00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
who I am is not reflected in the in the
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
information that's collected we which
 
00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
therefore means that the data is
 
00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
incorrect so whatever we're looking at
 
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
has holes in it already
 
00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:08.660 align:start position:0%
the other sadness was the removal of the
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation that judges receive bias
 
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
training and removed it to a suggestion
 
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
um I think if you're going to make sure
 
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
that one side of the law enforcement
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
equation has a variety of trainings the
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
other side needs to have the exact same
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
training and not a suggestion but a
 
00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
strong recommendation so that everyone
 
00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:35.339 align:start position:0%
has the exact same information and is
 
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
moving through as as individuals move
 
00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
through the through law enforcement and
 
00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
through the justice system they are
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
receiving the same Equitable treatment
 
00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
if there are issues then those issues
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
can be spotlighted and handled so
 
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
outside of that
 
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
I don't have anything further to add I
 
00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me this time to
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
speak I will certainly sign up to speak
 
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
next week relative to the uh the
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
amendment that's being put forth and
 
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
with that I would conclude my testimony
 
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate any questions that any
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%

accountability and community relations
 
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement in August the
 
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
commission issued as was said before 448
 
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:19.140 align:start position:0%
recommendations all of them have been
 
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
begun to be implemented many have been
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
completed as we stand here today there
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
were several items that required
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
legislation and this bill Senate Bill 96
 
00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
is an Omnibus Bill that contains all of
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
the recommendations except for two that
 
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
required legislation
 
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:40.510 align:start position:0%
required legislation
um

00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
I I was going to say many things that I
 
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
think have already been said so I for I
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
don't want to be repetitive but what I
 
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
will say is that the commission and the
 
00:53:53.809 --> 00:53:53.819 align:start position:0%
governor and the Attorney General all
 
00:53:53.819 --> 00:53:54.829 align:start position:0%
governor and the Attorney General all
believe

00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
that the more transparency there is in
 
00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:03.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:06.049 --> 00:54:06.059 align:start position:0%
accomplishes many of those
 
00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
um accomplishes that goal
 
00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
um and it makes much needed reforms to
 
00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:15.839 align:start position:0%
our juvenile law we can't uh overstate
 
00:54:18.829 --> 00:54:18.839 align:start position:0%
the the impact that this has and it is a
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
consensus bill I encourage the committee
 
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
to keep it a consensus bill
 
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh that's all I have I'm happy to
 
00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for uh attorney
 
00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.809 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for uh attorney
Brian

00:54:35.809 --> 00:54:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative McLean yeah uh thank
 
00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
question so just to follow up a little
 
00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
bit on the Gathering of the racial data
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
um as the doj uh Point person in
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
drafting the legislation I'm just trying
 
00:54:52.609 --> 00:54:52.619 align:start position:0%
to understand the concern that drove it
 
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
from you know straightforward Gathering
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
of data into the study commission if you
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
have any insight into what those are
 
00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
um I don't have I I only have
 
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
um kind of third hand information on it
 
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
so I I don't feel comfortable uh calling
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
out you know with with authority what
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
the exact concerns were I will say that
 
00:55:22.849 --> 00:55:22.859 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson had some concerns about
 
00:55:22.859 --> 00:55:23.990 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson had some concerns about
it

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.010 align:start position:0%
it
um

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
I I I had heard that
 
00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:31.140 align:start position:0%
um there's a possibility that
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
um just even a simple function of
 
00:55:33.359 --> 00:55:35.270 align:start position:0%
um just even a simple function of
placing

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
placing
 
00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.349 align:start position:0%
placing
um

00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
the racial information on the driver's
 
00:55:42.109 --> 00:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
license itself there's not physically
 
00:55:45.049 --> 00:55:45.059 align:start position:0%
space that would permit it as it's
 
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
currently constituted and and to also
 
00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
meet national standards for driver
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
licensing so I think that was one of the
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
issues that was raised there might have
 
00:55:56.089 --> 00:55:56.099 align:start position:0%
been other concerns uh that were raised
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:55:59.569 --> 00:55:59.579 align:start position:0%
um so you know although we we certainly
 
00:56:02.089 --> 00:56:02.099 align:start position:0%
support the original bill that was
 
00:56:02.099 --> 00:56:03.290 align:start position:0%
support the original bill that was
introduced

00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
um we we also uh you know support
 
00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
further study uh if that's necessary
 
00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
just so that we can get it right
 
00:56:14.569 --> 00:56:14.579 align:start position:0%
um and and I don't see that the The
 
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
Establishment or our offices and see the
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
establishment of the study committee
 
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
um as anything other than just punting
 
00:56:23.089 --> 00:56:23.099 align:start position:0%
to next legislative session
 
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
um and and we will continue to work on
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
the necessary reforms
 
00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
um but certainly either way if the
 
00:56:32.569 --> 00:56:32.579 align:start position:0%
committee were to add it back in we
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
would support it
 
00:56:35.329 --> 00:56:35.339 align:start position:0%
um if the committee were to pass this
 
00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
the bill as currently constituted we
 
00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
would support that as well
 
00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much and thank you
 
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm a little
 
00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:49.970 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm a little
puzzled

00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
puzzled
 
00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
um I understand that you're in a
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
somewhat delicate position
 
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
um not wanting to
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
um come out by saying anything that
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
indicates that you do not agree with
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
what the Senate did but
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
um if you were not in the legislative
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
environment but in a court and you were
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
asked do you support the language that
 
00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
the was in the original bill
 
00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
um what would your answer be
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent yes we support the
 
00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
original bill thank you very much I
 
00:57:32.569 --> 00:57:32.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:37.640 align:start position:0%
sure yes
 
00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia thank you Mr
 
00:57:41.809 --> 00:57:41.819 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you attorney broadhead
 
00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
um with regard to uh the legislature
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
giving instruction to the court for uh
 
00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:53.339 align:start position:0%
training uh do you see any concerns with
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
separation powers
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
I do I do I think that that was raised
 
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
uh by
 
00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
um Richard head in the Senate and um we
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
had it supported
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
um the to accommodate the judiciary's
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
position to uh withdraw that original
 
00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:14.940 align:start position:0%
language and replace it with the
 
00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
suggested language part of the issue
 
00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
with the original language was that
 
00:58:22.849 --> 00:58:22.859 align:start position:0%
um it said it was written in a way that
 
00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:25.140 align:start position:0%
um if I recall correctly
 
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
um that that it was ordering the Chief
 
00:58:32.089 --> 00:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
Justice to issue rules or regulations uh
 
00:58:34.609 --> 00:58:34.619 align:start position:0%
to require training and that's just not
 
00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
practically speaking
 
00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
um how they uh how they promulgate
 
00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:41.510 align:start position:0%
um how they uh how they promulgate
training

00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
um and they don't do it by rule making
 
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
and so uh the Judiciary uh has uh
 
00:58:50.089 --> 00:58:50.099 align:start position:0%
testified in the Senate that they have
 
00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
already adopted an annual training
 
00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
um for implicit bias they've already
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
trained their judges on it and they they
 
00:59:00.049 --> 00:59:00.059 align:start position:0%
plan to do that on an annual basis
 
00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
um I believe but if Richard head is
 
00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:06.260 align:start position:0%
still on I defer to him on specifically
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
you also
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chairman

00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:48.599 align:start position:0%

thank you again so Mr Norton are you
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
then saying that you would oppose an
 
01:00:57.789 --> 01:00:57.799 align:start position:0%
amendment which puts back into the bill
 
01:01:02.890 --> 01:01:02.900 align:start position:0%
the language that Lee act had requested
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
and that was removed by the Senate
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
um uh and in which the Senate converted
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
to a study committee very specific
 
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
recommendation that Lee act had
 
01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your for that
 
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
clarification representative Smith no I
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
I support the the bill as it was
 
01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
originally written um as you've
 
01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
previously heard there was a lot of
 
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
discussion about uh and compromise in
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
the in the commission relative to that
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
uh specific recommendation and so I
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
would support an amendment to restore
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
that to the bill
 
01:01:40.559 --> 01:01:42.530 align:start position:0%
that to the bill
yeah

01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:01:45.049 --> 01:01:45.059 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:49.609 --> 01:01:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:01:53.809 --> 01:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
is uh there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
I see no hands
 
01:02:12.289 --> 01:02:12.299 align:start position:0%
and so we'll conclude the hearing on
 
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
I believe that that concludes our
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
morning business we are scheduled for an
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
executive session at one o'clock today
 
01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:28.940 align:start position:0%
and we will see unless there's other
 
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
concerns or business to do
 
01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
I'm 43. well just we'll do that this
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
afternoon okay
 
01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.800 --> 03:55:48.229 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:55:48.229 --> 03:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:48.239 --> 03:55:52.010 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:55:52.010 --> 03:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:59.570 --> 03:55:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:02.450 --> 03:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
good afternoon to our Union Leader cover
 
03:56:04.370 --> 03:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
boy well actually I didn't have your
 
03:56:05.809 --> 03:56:05.819 align:start position:0%
picture but
 
03:56:08.090 --> 03:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
uh keep in mind we are being recorded
 
03:56:08.100 --> 03:56:12.710 align:start position:0%
uh keep in mind we are being recorded
yes

03:56:12.710 --> 03:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:42.729 --> 03:56:42.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:05.040 --> 03:57:40.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:57:40.070 --> 03:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:58.389 --> 03:57:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:20.050 --> 04:00:20.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:34.210 --> 04:00:34.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:37.130 --> 04:00:37.140 align:start position:0%
okay we'll call this meeting of the
 
04:00:45.349 --> 04:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:47.929 --> 04:00:47.939 align:start position:0%
looks like we have everyone here with
 
04:00:49.610 --> 04:00:49.620 align:start position:0%
the exception
 
04:00:49.620 --> 04:00:54.830 align:start position:0%
the exception
Americans

04:00:54.830 --> 04:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:58.370 --> 04:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
but uh I guess we're beginner we'll
 
04:01:00.710 --> 04:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
begin our discussion with Senate bill
 
04:01:06.309 --> 04:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:11.809 --> 04:01:11.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:14.389 --> 04:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
so I will move
 
04:01:19.130 --> 04:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:19.140 --> 04:01:23.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:01:23.150 --> 04:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:25.130 --> 04:01:25.140 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia moved out to pass
 
04:01:28.250 --> 04:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
and with an amendment and you have an
 
04:01:30.229 --> 04:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
amendment to offer
 
04:01:34.130 --> 04:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:36.710 --> 04:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative rice
 
04:01:40.250 --> 04:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
and you want to address your Amendment
 
04:01:42.110 --> 04:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
all right so um
 
04:01:46.610 --> 04:01:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:46.620 --> 04:01:57.189 align:start position:0%
 
1386h

04:01:57.189 --> 04:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:09.290 --> 04:02:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:09.300 --> 04:02:14.229 align:start position:0%
 
relaxation

04:02:14.229 --> 04:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:19.189 --> 04:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment absolutely so this removes the
 
04:02:29.269 --> 04:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:32.450 --> 04:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
a third part with the study committee is
 
04:02:35.570 --> 04:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
obviously a much better way to go
 
04:02:38.929 --> 04:02:38.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:38.939 --> 04:02:40.969 align:start position:0%
 
to

04:02:40.969 --> 04:02:40.979 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:02:43.910 --> 04:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
implement it with such a radical change
 
04:02:46.250 --> 04:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
without a real
 
04:02:47.510 --> 04:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:02:50.389 --> 04:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to discuss
 
04:02:50.399 --> 04:02:51.950 align:start position:0%
opportunity to discuss
changes

04:02:51.950 --> 04:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
changes
 
04:02:55.189 --> 04:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
it's a little fast there's a lot we put
 
04:02:58.070 --> 04:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
into 91a
 
04:02:59.889 --> 04:02:59.899 align:start position:0%
lots of work
 
04:03:05.030 --> 04:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
over the years we've fine-tunes and I do
 
04:03:07.389 --> 04:03:07.399 align:start position:0%
when I hate to make sure that we have
 
04:03:11.630 --> 04:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
good opportunity for the folks to
 
04:03:15.170 --> 04:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
get information and also information for
 
04:03:18.189 --> 04:03:18.199 align:start position:0%
non-public sessions while
 
04:03:22.610 --> 04:03:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.429 --> 04:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
provides a lot of opportunity for remote
 
04:03:29.510 --> 04:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
access for the public
 
04:03:33.170 --> 04:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
and the body I think that the more
 
04:03:35.809 --> 04:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
serious concern is
 
04:03:42.170 --> 04:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:44.809 --> 04:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
from what I've been involved in tend to
 
04:03:44.819 --> 04:03:46.210 align:start position:0%
from what I've been involved in tend to
lack

04:03:46.210 --> 04:03:46.220 align:start position:0%
lack
 
04:03:48.410 --> 04:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
the real
 
04:03:51.590 --> 04:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
communication that is necessary for
 
04:03:54.349 --> 04:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
instance yesterday there was a press
 
04:03:56.330 --> 04:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
conference that I attended on a certain
 
04:03:59.530 --> 04:03:59.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
bipartisan in nature but uh
 
04:04:05.210 --> 04:04:05.220 align:start position:0%
at the press conference uh believe it or
 
04:04:07.250 --> 04:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
not you know there's Republicans
 
04:04:09.889 --> 04:04:09.899 align:start position:0%
Democrats benetary
 
04:04:12.110 --> 04:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
and some of the folks who actually
 
04:04:14.929 --> 04:04:14.939 align:start position:0%
testified on this bill last week
 
04:04:17.389 --> 04:04:17.399 align:start position:0%
and we actually had an opportunity to
 
04:04:17.399 --> 04:04:18.889 align:start position:0%
and we actually had an opportunity to
talk

04:04:18.889 --> 04:04:18.899 align:start position:0%
talk
 
04:04:18.899 --> 04:04:21.590 align:start position:0%
talk
and

04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:25.550 --> 04:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
remotely do not get the same kind of
 
04:04:27.229 --> 04:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
communication as you do in person
 
04:04:29.150 --> 04:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot missing there's facial
 
04:04:31.309 --> 04:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
expressions even facial expressions that
 
04:04:33.170 --> 04:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
are hidden behind mass at least if
 
04:04:35.330 --> 04:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
you're face-to-face
 
04:04:37.910 --> 04:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
get a better idea
 
04:04:41.630 --> 04:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
the contemporaneous matter is really
 
04:04:43.309 --> 04:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
lost in these things it's not
 
04:04:45.950 --> 04:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
contemporaneous if two people start
 
04:04:48.530 --> 04:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
talking over Zoom or whatever electronic
 
04:04:48.540 --> 04:04:49.670 align:start position:0%
talking over Zoom or whatever electronic
method

04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
method
 
04:04:51.950 --> 04:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
it just clashes because they're not
 
04:04:55.010 --> 04:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
really it's not a duplex system so if I
 
04:04:56.389 --> 04:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
started saying something out of water
 
04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
and perhaps the chairman was not here
 
04:04:59.689 --> 04:04:59.699 align:start position:0%
with us
 
04:05:02.750 --> 04:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh he might be able to say something but
 
04:05:04.849 --> 04:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
if I'm speaking loudly
 
04:05:07.070 --> 04:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
that's going to shut him down
 
04:05:09.889 --> 04:05:09.899 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of problems that come
 
04:05:11.870 --> 04:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
with remote meetings
 
04:05:15.950 --> 04:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
that really need a much deeper study and
 
04:05:18.110 --> 04:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
I think that removing part one and
 
04:05:22.189 --> 04:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
hanging on to part three will give us
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
the time to really dig into it deeply
 
04:05:26.689 --> 04:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we do it right the
 
04:05:28.010 --> 04:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
first time and I'll have to come back
 
04:05:31.130 --> 04:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
and fix it again later it's part one and
 
04:05:33.790 --> 04:05:33.800 align:start position:0%
two you mean yes
 
04:05:38.210 --> 04:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
so part three it so the bill analysis
 
04:05:38.220 --> 04:05:39.670 align:start position:0%
so part three it so the bill analysis
has

04:05:39.670 --> 04:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:05:42.910 --> 04:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
the pieces
 
04:05:47.510 --> 04:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
misorders so ignore the bill analysis so
 
04:05:50.450 --> 04:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
part two in this is actually the
 
04:05:52.790 --> 04:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
violation of privacy and patient privacy
 
04:05:58.630 --> 04:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
so part one is the part that has to do
 
04:06:02.450 --> 04:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
with implementing a remote session
 
04:06:05.450 --> 04:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
part three is study committees
 
04:06:07.790 --> 04:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
development to that so I think the study
 
04:06:11.030 --> 04:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee is good but the implementation
 
04:06:13.130 --> 04:06:13.140 align:start position:0%
it's it's just a little too soon to do
 
04:06:15.769 --> 04:06:15.779 align:start position:0%
that and and we need to do it right and
 
04:06:18.170 --> 04:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
I don't want to do it
 
04:06:22.990 --> 04:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:23.000 --> 04:06:24.650 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:06:24.650 --> 04:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay representative Birch
 
04:06:30.830 --> 04:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:33.469 --> 04:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
uh yes I do and thank you Mr chair and
 
04:06:36.469 --> 04:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
it's actually it's a it's a question to
 
04:06:39.170 --> 04:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the amendment because I'm
 
04:06:41.450 --> 04:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
a bit puzzled by the argument and
 
04:06:44.630 --> 04:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but it's my
 
04:06:46.849 --> 04:06:46.859 align:start position:0%
understanding first of all that this is
 
04:06:46.859 --> 04:06:48.410 align:start position:0%
understanding first of all that this is
permissive

04:06:48.410 --> 04:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
permissive
 
04:06:53.410 --> 04:06:53.420 align:start position:0%
that let's say if my local select board
 
04:06:56.090 --> 04:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
wants to utilize these Provisions in
 
04:06:58.309 --> 04:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
West Milan they would be able to but
 
04:07:01.370 --> 04:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:05.809 --> 04:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
um and thus it's not the the uh the
 
04:07:08.090 --> 04:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
Supreme legislature often conquered
 
04:07:10.910 --> 04:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
making this decision it could be well
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
local bodies and am I correct that you
 
04:07:16.550 --> 04:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
are opposed to that
 
04:07:19.370 --> 04:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
I am opposed to
 
04:07:19.380 --> 04:07:20.750 align:start position:0%
I am opposed to
uh

04:07:20.750 --> 04:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:07:23.330 --> 04:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
implementing those messages stated in
 
04:07:25.670 --> 04:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
part one I think it's it's not
 
04:07:28.250 --> 04:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
as well thought out as we would like it
 
04:07:34.729 --> 04:07:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:39.590 --> 04:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
and just one final follow-up if I could
 
04:07:43.969 --> 04:07:43.979 align:start position:0%
um see no objection uh you suggest that
 
04:07:48.769 --> 04:07:48.779 align:start position:0%
we need to study it more haven't we been
 
04:07:52.250 --> 04:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
laboratory animals ourselves uh for a
 
04:07:55.610 --> 04:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
considerable period of time uh far more
 
04:07:57.830 --> 04:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
than a study committee normally devotes
 
04:08:01.670 --> 04:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
to a topic so haven't we been the study
 
04:08:04.550 --> 04:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
committee uh we in the legislature is
 
04:08:07.610 --> 04:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
there really need to do more of what we
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
already know we may be in favor we may
 
04:08:12.050 --> 04:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
be opposed but it's not the subject
 
04:08:15.010 --> 04:08:15.020 align:start position:0%
matter that we're unfamiliar with
 
04:08:17.750 --> 04:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
also I would say that the experiment has
 
04:08:17.760 --> 04:08:18.889 align:start position:0%
also I would say that the experiment has
gone

04:08:18.889 --> 04:08:18.899 align:start position:0%
gone
 
04:08:21.769 --> 04:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
somewhat badly in some sections it's
 
04:08:24.050 --> 04:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
certainly good for the public that wants
 
04:08:26.889 --> 04:08:26.899 align:start position:0%
to view from their home but as far as
 
04:08:28.990 --> 04:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
communicating between
 
04:08:33.650 --> 04:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
committee members it's terrible so yes I
 
04:08:36.170 --> 04:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
do believe that we need to study a way
 
04:08:38.210 --> 04:08:38.220 align:start position:0%
that we can do this even even prior to
 
04:08:41.269 --> 04:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
the this emergency when we had uh let's
 
04:08:43.250 --> 04:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
say counseling delegation meetings and
 
04:08:45.349 --> 04:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
we have one person call in because they
 
04:08:49.429 --> 04:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
are not able to attend uh even then I
 
04:08:51.790 --> 04:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
opposed because it's
 
04:08:55.030 --> 04:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
it does not give you the equal footing
 
04:08:57.710 --> 04:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
with your remote try and call in and
 
04:09:00.530 --> 04:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
make a point you are at a disadvantage
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
so I I think people said it really needs
 
04:09:05.150 --> 04:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
a much
 
04:09:07.309 --> 04:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
more considerations
 
04:09:08.990 --> 04:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:09:11.450 --> 04:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
04:09:13.429 --> 04:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
um yes well one concern is
 
04:09:15.469 --> 04:09:15.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair one concern
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
and with Sylvia is talking about um you
 
04:09:19.729 --> 04:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
know being able to communicate
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
informally with the uh committee members
 
04:09:25.309 --> 04:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
and actually that's true but the 91a law
 
04:09:27.290 --> 04:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
is written is trying to restrict that
 
04:09:28.849 --> 04:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
sort of thing as much as possible at
 
04:09:28.859 --> 04:09:29.510 align:start position:0%
sort of thing as much as possible at
least

04:09:29.510 --> 04:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
least
 
04:09:31.910 --> 04:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
expect the ideally
 
04:09:33.950 --> 04:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
if everybody did it the way it's
 
04:09:35.929 --> 04:09:35.939 align:start position:0%
intended there would never be any uh
 
04:09:37.729 --> 04:09:37.739 align:start position:0%
private Communications at least between
 
04:09:40.010 --> 04:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
members of the body at all or even
 
04:09:42.590 --> 04:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
thinking about even obviously that isn't
 
04:09:46.010 --> 04:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
100 uh doable so I think um
 
04:09:48.349 --> 04:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
that sort of flies a little bit in like
 
04:09:49.969 --> 04:09:49.979 align:start position:0%
what the 91a which is trying to
 
04:09:53.210 --> 04:09:53.220 align:start position:0%
formalize body showed everything there
 
04:09:54.950 --> 04:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
their liberations are as much as
 
04:09:57.650 --> 04:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
possible totally you know on in public
 
04:09:59.870 --> 04:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
and certainly um the hybrid meetings
 
04:10:01.010 --> 04:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
first of all there's an automatic
 
04:10:03.650 --> 04:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
recording capability built into it so
 
04:10:05.870 --> 04:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
now there's a uh contemporaries
 
04:10:07.429 --> 04:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
recording of everything that's said at
 
04:10:10.910 --> 04:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
every meeting which uh I think is a
 
04:10:12.769 --> 04:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
and generally certainly good thing in
 
04:10:14.269 --> 04:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
the house where like it was impossible
 
04:10:16.130 --> 04:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
even to all you had were like
 
04:10:17.929 --> 04:10:17.939 align:start position:0%
handwritten notes by the clerk so like
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
it was even if you're at the meeting
 
04:10:20.809 --> 04:10:20.819 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's hard to figure out what
 
04:10:23.330 --> 04:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
it actually transpired so I think
 
04:10:25.729 --> 04:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
um so that's a good thing there's also a
 
04:10:28.010 --> 04:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
less scope for uh
 
04:10:29.750 --> 04:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
for certain types of issues there's less
 
04:10:32.929 --> 04:10:32.939 align:start position:0%
scope for intimidation like um with uh
 
04:10:34.910 --> 04:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
bills involving guns there's always lots
 
04:10:36.110 --> 04:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
of people coming
 
04:10:39.530 --> 04:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
open carrying their guns or uh
 
04:10:42.769 --> 04:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
and uh intimidates some people who are
 
04:10:44.689 --> 04:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
sometimes refrigerated weapons people
 
04:10:46.070 --> 04:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
who feared weapons although I'm not sure
 
04:10:48.170 --> 04:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
why carrying weapons is irrational so
 
04:10:52.010 --> 04:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
that puts certain types of debate on a
 
04:10:53.269 --> 04:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
more uh
 
04:10:55.490 --> 04:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
more more equal footing like it went to
 
04:10:58.189 --> 04:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
a second amendment or gun Bill yesterday
 
04:11:00.950 --> 04:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
and you know the uh people had the guns
 
04:11:02.210 --> 04:11:02.220 align:start position:0%
and people didn't you couldn't tell who
 
04:11:03.410 --> 04:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
was who because we're all sitting at
 
04:11:05.090 --> 04:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
home our little rectangles I think
 
04:11:07.250 --> 04:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
that's uh that was beneficial for that
 
04:11:09.830 --> 04:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
debate so I I think uh
 
04:11:11.450 --> 04:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
finally the main thing which maybe is
 
04:11:12.769 --> 04:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
all I need to say is this has been
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
extremely popular with the public think
 
04:11:14.399 --> 04:11:15.229 align:start position:0%
extremely popular with the public think
of

04:11:15.229 --> 04:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:11:18.229 --> 04:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
participation in meeting you know both
 
04:11:21.050 --> 04:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
legislative hearings and uh you know
 
04:11:23.689 --> 04:11:23.699 align:start position:0%
town you know Town meetings and County
 
04:11:27.410 --> 04:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
meetings it's gone up a lot so it's kind
 
04:11:29.750 --> 04:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
of um you know it's people uh people
 
04:11:31.610 --> 04:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
find some more
 
04:11:34.130 --> 04:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
area you can find us some more there are
 
04:11:35.450 --> 04:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
technical diffuse but I think in general
 
04:11:37.130 --> 04:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
people find this to be a more congenial
 
04:11:38.870 --> 04:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
way to interact with their government
 
04:11:42.469 --> 04:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
than the old way of doing it so um I
 
04:11:44.389 --> 04:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
think we should uh I think we should
 
04:11:45.889 --> 04:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
keep some of these innovations that
 
04:11:47.809 --> 04:11:47.819 align:start position:0%
we're forced to make in place so um
 
04:11:50.809 --> 04:11:50.819 align:start position:0%
that's um so I think uh I think this is
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
a bad amendment I think part one is part
 
04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
one is good as it is um you know it
 
04:11:56.450 --> 04:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
certainly doesn't need to be eliminated
 
04:11:59.090 --> 04:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
so thanks
 
04:12:01.610 --> 04:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
representative McLean uh yeah thank you
 
04:12:04.610 --> 04:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I definitely think that you
 
04:12:07.969 --> 04:12:07.979 align:start position:0%
know remote access does have a place in
 
04:12:10.070 --> 04:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
the future I mean if we look at the
 
04:12:12.710 --> 04:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
local level I'm often seen large groups
 
04:12:16.010 --> 04:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
kind of dominate the discussion and the
 
04:12:19.490 --> 04:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
increased access may be beneficial you
 
04:12:21.710 --> 04:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
know to individual citizens in the town
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
and help level the playing field I think
 
04:12:26.750 --> 04:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
that's the good but we also have to take
 
04:12:31.130 --> 04:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
into account the bad and um some of the
 
04:12:33.229 --> 04:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
bad that we've witnessed number one is
 
04:12:36.110 --> 04:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
we have seen in this legislature
 
04:12:38.630 --> 04:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
um I think luckily not in this committee
 
04:12:41.570 --> 04:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
but in many other committees I've seen
 
04:12:44.570 --> 04:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
Decor really go away and in many cases
 
04:12:46.189 --> 04:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
watching these committee hearings not
 
04:12:48.110 --> 04:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
like watching the committee here it's
 
04:12:50.450 --> 04:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
like watching Twitter and I think the
 
04:12:52.490 --> 04:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
one thing that has kept it from being
 
04:12:55.010 --> 04:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
Twitter plus is that many members of the
 
04:12:56.990 --> 04:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
committee have formed these
 
04:12:58.490 --> 04:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
relationships these in-person
 
04:13:01.010 --> 04:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
relationships so if it's through a
 
04:13:02.689 --> 04:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
thought experiment where you move
 
04:13:05.389 --> 04:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
yourselves out five ten years in the
 
04:13:07.790 --> 04:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
future where this legislature has turned
 
04:13:09.889 --> 04:13:09.899 align:start position:0%
over and we don't have those
 
04:13:12.769 --> 04:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
relationships what will be the decorum
 
04:13:14.809 --> 04:13:14.819 align:start position:0%
like in that case
 
04:13:16.670 --> 04:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
um also as representative Sylvia
 
04:13:19.130 --> 04:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
mentioned if you look at economy
 
04:13:21.650 --> 04:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
delegation level I'm in the Hillsborough
 
04:13:24.170 --> 04:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
County delegation which is admittedly
 
04:13:26.990 --> 04:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
the largest delegation but those
 
04:13:29.870 --> 04:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
meetings remotely in my opinion were
 
04:13:32.750 --> 04:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
apps absolutely unworkable former
 
04:13:34.790 --> 04:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative Kermit Williams who is
 
04:13:38.990 --> 04:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
awesome in his best he was a real leader
 
04:13:42.110 --> 04:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
but he was just completely overwhelmed
 
04:13:45.229 --> 04:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
by this this mode of doing things so
 
04:13:47.150 --> 04:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
there are places where it works and
 
04:13:49.429 --> 04:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
there are places where it don't work if
 
04:13:52.189 --> 04:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work I'm sorry the problem is
 
04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know to representative purchase
 
04:13:57.229 --> 04:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
Point while it is only permissive
 
04:14:00.830 --> 04:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
um I think inertia if we just let this
 
04:14:03.950 --> 04:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
thing go straight out of the state of
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
emergency inertia is going to keep that
 
04:14:09.170 --> 04:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
going in One Direction and we really
 
04:14:12.710 --> 04:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
strongly run the risk of carrying the
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
bad in with the good and so what the
 
04:14:19.969 --> 04:14:19.979 align:start position:0%
break does what the stop when the state
 
04:14:22.790 --> 04:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
emergency ends is it puts a break on
 
04:14:25.010 --> 04:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
things and prevents that inertia from
 
04:14:27.769 --> 04:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
happening and gives pause to allow the
 
04:14:30.920 --> 04:14:30.930 align:start position:0%
study committee to understand fully
 
04:14:30.930 --> 04:14:36.309 align:start position:0%
study committee to understand fully
[Music]

04:14:36.309 --> 04:14:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:39.349 --> 04:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
but we need the pause just because we
 
04:14:40.849 --> 04:14:40.859 align:start position:0%
need to break the inertia in right
 
04:14:42.710 --> 04:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
position so I think this is a good
 
04:14:45.010 --> 04:14:45.020 align:start position:0%
amendment to not be supportive
 
04:14:47.809 --> 04:14:47.819 align:start position:0%
representative wolper thank you Mr
 
04:14:47.819 --> 04:14:49.309 align:start position:0%
representative wolper thank you Mr
chairman

04:14:49.309 --> 04:14:49.319 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:14:51.410 --> 04:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to start with the idea of
 
04:14:51.420 --> 04:14:53.450 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to start with the idea of
participation

04:14:53.450 --> 04:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
participation
 
04:14:56.750 --> 04:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
and I think we all applaud to vastly
 
04:14:59.210 --> 04:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
increased public participation
 
04:15:01.429 --> 04:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
and in everything that's been going on
 
04:15:03.349 --> 04:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's a planning board meeting in
 
04:15:05.030 --> 04:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
the town of Stratford or its attendance
 
04:15:07.070 --> 04:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
at these committee hearings that's all
 
04:15:07.080 --> 04:15:08.570 align:start position:0%
at these committee hearings that's all
wonderful

04:15:08.570 --> 04:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
04:15:10.849 --> 04:15:10.859 align:start position:0%
it also doesn't require a change in the
 
04:15:10.859 --> 04:15:12.050 align:start position:0%
it also doesn't require a change in the
law

04:15:12.050 --> 04:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:15:15.769 --> 04:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
any board or committee can allow can
 
04:15:15.779 --> 04:15:16.790 align:start position:0%
any board or committee can allow can
implement

04:15:16.790 --> 04:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
implement
 
04:15:21.410 --> 04:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
remote participation by the public
 
04:15:23.689 --> 04:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
whenever they feel like it because you
 
04:15:25.729 --> 04:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
know 91a does not say you can't do that
 
04:15:29.450 --> 04:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
91 is there to increase transparency and
 
04:15:31.370 --> 04:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
be welcoming of that
 
04:15:33.830 --> 04:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
this is only about
 
04:15:36.889 --> 04:15:36.899 align:start position:0%
the boards and committees meeting in
 
04:15:36.899 --> 04:15:37.969 align:start position:0%
the boards and committees meeting in
person

04:15:37.969 --> 04:15:37.979 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:15:37.979 --> 04:15:39.710 align:start position:0%
person
and

04:15:39.710 --> 04:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
along with what representative Sylvia
 
04:15:43.250 --> 04:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
began with
 
04:15:46.210 --> 04:15:46.220 align:start position:0%
the fact that that that's
 
04:15:50.650 --> 04:15:50.660 align:start position:0%
opportunity to not be gathered in person
 
04:15:54.050 --> 04:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
has been relegated to only emergencies
 
04:15:57.290 --> 04:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
in 91a to me should carry a lot of
 
04:16:00.769 --> 04:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
weight that was not just furiously
 
04:16:04.010 --> 04:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
thrown in that's been talked about and
 
04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
talked over time and again just in my
 
04:16:08.269 --> 04:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
time on this committee and it predates
 
04:16:09.650 --> 04:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
when I got here
 
04:16:12.349 --> 04:16:12.359 align:start position:0%
so so there's that but see I don't see
 
04:16:14.870 --> 04:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
any great the benefits of public
 
04:16:16.849 --> 04:16:16.859 align:start position:0%
participation are available whether we
 
04:16:18.170 --> 04:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
do this or not
 
04:16:19.729 --> 04:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
I've heard
 
04:16:22.849 --> 04:16:22.859 align:start position:0%
of committee members who were denied
 
04:16:25.729 --> 04:16:25.739 align:start position:0%
access remote access to their own not in
 
04:16:26.750 --> 04:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
the house
 
04:16:29.090 --> 04:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
04:16:31.370 --> 04:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
have been denied remote access to the
 
04:16:33.469 --> 04:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
board upon which they said they could
 
04:16:35.510 --> 04:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
get in
 
04:16:37.550 --> 04:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
but the person running the control of
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
meeting wouldn't let them speak
 
04:16:41.929 --> 04:16:41.939 align:start position:0%
just like that
 
04:16:45.110 --> 04:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know how widespread that is it
 
04:16:46.550 --> 04:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be very widespread
 
04:16:48.530 --> 04:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
before it's a really big problem
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh I've heard other people talking about
 
04:16:53.269 --> 04:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
other kinds of problems
 
04:16:56.450 --> 04:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
and I just really think that this is
 
04:16:58.790 --> 04:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
such a big deal because if we go this
 
04:17:02.630 --> 04:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
way we can be pretty confident that our
 
04:17:04.550 --> 04:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
executive the board meetings will be
 
04:17:07.130 --> 04:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
like our executive session is today
 
04:17:09.710 --> 04:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
when we have half the people here
 
04:17:12.710 --> 04:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
and the other half are not
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
this would be bad this would be bad
 
04:17:17.090 --> 04:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
trucks select boards and school boards
 
04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
and I don't care how many who they are
 
04:17:21.469 --> 04:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
and I recognize that there are a lot of
 
04:17:23.450 --> 04:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
uh committees and Boards Commissions in
 
04:17:25.030 --> 04:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
our state you know
 
04:17:27.469 --> 04:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
geographically widespread and want to be
 
04:17:30.590 --> 04:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
able to do this I do appreciate that but
 
04:17:34.189 --> 04:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
before we just throw the door open
 
04:17:36.790 --> 04:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
I think we have to be a lot more
 
04:17:39.050 --> 04:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
reflective about it and I think the
 
04:17:40.490 --> 04:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
study committee is the way to get that
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
reflection so I'll be supporting the
 
04:17:42.840 --> 04:17:44.689 align:start position:0%
reflection so I'll be supporting the
amendment

04:17:44.689 --> 04:17:44.699 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:17:44.699 --> 04:17:45.590 align:start position:0%
amendment
yeah

04:17:45.590 --> 04:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:17:47.689 --> 04:17:47.699 align:start position:0%
ribs and Horgan did you still have your
 
04:17:49.729 --> 04:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
hand up do you want to speak again oh
 
04:17:53.090 --> 04:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
um what I would just say they're talking
 
04:17:57.469 --> 04:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
about being like uh Twitter plus some I
 
04:18:00.670 --> 04:18:00.680 align:start position:0%
think there's been misbehavior and uh
 
04:18:03.710 --> 04:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
silly things happening in the in
 
04:18:06.410 --> 04:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
committee house committee meetings all
 
04:18:08.389 --> 04:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
along it's just now
 
04:18:10.309 --> 04:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
now there's like a camera trained on and
 
04:18:12.729 --> 04:18:12.739 align:start position:0%
everybody can see it so I don't think uh
 
04:18:14.689 --> 04:18:14.699 align:start position:0%
I don't think I don't think we're
 
04:18:16.490 --> 04:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
necessarily behaving any better or worse
 
04:18:17.630 --> 04:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
than we do probably a little better
 
04:18:20.269 --> 04:18:20.279 align:start position:0%
because uh that's you know they're uh
 
04:18:23.570 --> 04:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
where more eyes uh watching us I think
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
um I think from that that's not really
 
04:18:27.469 --> 04:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
that particular argument against it like
 
04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't hold much water for me are
 
04:18:30.349 --> 04:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
certainly you know the people have a
 
04:18:30.359 --> 04:18:31.250 align:start position:0%
certainly you know the people have a
right

04:18:31.250 --> 04:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:18:33.349 --> 04:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
I think it's useful for us to see what
 
04:18:33.359 --> 04:18:34.070 align:start position:0%
I think it's useful for us to see what
we're

04:18:34.070 --> 04:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:18:36.050 --> 04:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
see what we're up to but I haven't seen
 
04:18:37.370 --> 04:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
you know there's been some embarrassing
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
meetings on Zoom but there are
 
04:18:40.370 --> 04:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
embarrassing meetings back uh before
 
04:18:42.410 --> 04:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
we're on Zoom it's just nobody who
 
04:18:44.269 --> 04:18:44.279 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the room unless there's a
 
04:18:46.849 --> 04:18:46.859 align:start position:0%
camera an official camera pointed at the
 
04:18:49.370 --> 04:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
room uh ever saw it and now people see
 
04:18:52.670 --> 04:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
it but I think so that's that part of it
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh that part of I think it's good that I
 
04:18:55.670 --> 04:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
think it's probably good that everything
 
04:18:59.090 --> 04:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
that we're being recorded So
 
04:19:01.070 --> 04:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
even though I tend to say funny things
 
04:19:03.889 --> 04:19:03.899 align:start position:0%
sometimes so
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's just all I had to say about that
 
04:19:10.130 --> 04:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative Simpson
 
04:19:11.990 --> 04:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:19:13.670 --> 04:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to say I'm voting against
 
04:19:16.130 --> 04:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
this amendment um because of how many
 
04:19:18.830 --> 04:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
members of bodies and of the public that
 
04:19:20.210 --> 04:19:20.220 align:start position:0%
I heard that have really appreciated
 
04:19:23.870 --> 04:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
this uh option but I also wanted to say
 
04:19:26.450 --> 04:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
that um we heard from the Senate that in
 
04:19:28.849 --> 04:19:28.859 align:start position:0%
their compromise part of what they did
 
04:19:31.969 --> 04:19:31.979 align:start position:0%
was Institute a sunset Clause so that if
 
04:19:34.250 --> 04:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
after the study committee met there
 
04:19:36.170 --> 04:19:36.180 align:start position:0%
wasn't um agreement that this should go
 
04:19:38.510 --> 04:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
forward because of any issues that um
 
04:19:40.670 --> 04:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
seem too pervasive
 
04:19:43.429 --> 04:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
um it would automatically Sunset so I
 
04:19:46.010 --> 04:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
just wanted to remind uh other
 
04:19:47.929 --> 04:19:47.939 align:start position:0%
colleagues who might be concerned about
 
04:19:47.939 --> 04:19:49.309 align:start position:0%
colleagues who might be concerned about
that

04:19:49.309 --> 04:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:19:50.710 --> 04:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:19:54.769 --> 04:19:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:56.610 --> 04:19:56.620 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to
 
04:19:56.620 --> 04:20:00.590 align:start position:0%

04:20:17.210 --> 04:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
if not we have a motion the motion is on
 
04:20:17.220 --> 04:20:20.290 align:start position:0%
if not we have a motion the motion is on

04:20:37.010 --> 04:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
other questions then Mr clerkin could
 
04:20:38.750 --> 04:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
call the role
 
04:20:40.450 --> 04:20:40.460 align:start position:0%

seconded by representative naughter
 
04:22:30.290 --> 04:22:30.300 align:start position:0%
I want to address your Amendment
 
04:22:32.630 --> 04:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
yes indeed so uh
 
04:22:34.250 --> 04:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
04:22:39.590 --> 04:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh removes part two of USB 95
 
04:22:42.950 --> 04:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
. this is a part on invasions of privacy
 
04:22:48.050 --> 04:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:48.060 --> 04:22:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:56.030 --> 04:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
so sometimes uh the remote readings
 
04:23:00.710 --> 04:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
which I attended at home last week
 
04:23:04.370 --> 04:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
occasionally missed some testimony but I
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
don't recall much testimony on this
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
section of the bill
 
04:23:08.880 --> 04:23:14.450 align:start position:0%
section of the bill
s

04:23:14.450 --> 04:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:14.460 --> 04:23:15.889 align:start position:0%
 
but

04:23:15.889 --> 04:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:23:18.170 --> 04:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
there's little doubt
 
04:23:21.050 --> 04:23:21.060 align:start position:0%
that those who are found guilty of
 
04:23:22.910 --> 04:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
those crimes
 
04:23:25.309 --> 04:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
Reserve their punishment and a
 
04:23:28.010 --> 04:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor allows sentencing of up to a
 
04:23:31.189 --> 04:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
year for these accounts charged
 
04:23:33.410 --> 04:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you testimony to the number of
 
04:23:36.950 --> 04:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
cases and the extent of full year terms
 
04:23:39.050 --> 04:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
sentenced to
 
04:23:40.670 --> 04:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely
 
04:23:41.990 --> 04:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
the first offense
 
04:23:44.210 --> 04:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
brings a full year in jail
 
04:23:48.710 --> 04:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
therefore we currently have a graduated
 
04:23:52.610 --> 04:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:55.370 --> 04:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
so by increasing the crime to a felony
 
04:23:57.769 --> 04:23:57.779 align:start position:0%
we stand to suffer from consequences
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
which may not have been contemplated
 
04:24:05.750 --> 04:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
first a felony charge will bring a much
 
04:24:08.630 --> 04:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
stronger defense with Associated costs
 
04:24:11.630 --> 04:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
to courts and possibly extending the
 
04:24:15.050 --> 04:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:17.990 --> 04:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
also there's a higher likelihood of a
 
04:24:20.929 --> 04:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
jury trial once again impacting the
 
04:24:20.939 --> 04:24:23.570 align:start position:0%
jury trial once again impacting the
victim

04:24:23.570 --> 04:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:26.570 --> 04:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility a hope CD deal
 
04:24:29.750 --> 04:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
which might disguise
 
04:24:33.349 --> 04:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
the acts that the perpetrator committed
 
04:24:35.389 --> 04:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
that lead to a different
 
04:24:35.399 --> 04:24:37.370 align:start position:0%
that lead to a different
Prime

04:24:37.370 --> 04:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
Prime
 
04:24:40.370 --> 04:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
also if the offender is sentenced to
 
04:24:42.830 --> 04:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
State Prison
 
04:24:45.170 --> 04:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
they are likely
 
04:24:48.769 --> 04:24:48.779 align:start position:0%
not to return to the streets as reformed
 
04:24:52.010 --> 04:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
people they're more likely to perhaps
 
04:24:53.929 --> 04:24:53.939 align:start position:0%
pick up
 
04:24:58.610 --> 04:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
lastly our constitution tells us in part
 
04:25:04.790 --> 04:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
first article 18 I quote
 
04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
all penalties
 
04:25:08.269 --> 04:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
ought to be proportioned to the nature
 
04:25:09.769 --> 04:25:09.779 align:start position:0%
of the offense
 
04:25:12.650 --> 04:25:12.660 align:start position:0%
no wise legislature will affix the same
 
04:25:12.660 --> 04:25:14.030 align:start position:0%
no wise legislature will affix the same
punishment

04:25:14.030 --> 04:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
punishment
 
04:25:16.610 --> 04:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
so the crimes of theft forgery and the
 
04:25:16.620 --> 04:25:17.389 align:start position:0%
so the crimes of theft forgery and the
like

04:25:17.389 --> 04:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:25:20.689 --> 04:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
who stay due to those of murder and
 
04:25:20.699 --> 04:25:22.130 align:start position:0%
who stay due to those of murder and
treason

04:25:22.130 --> 04:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
treason
 
04:25:24.710 --> 04:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
where the same undistinguishing severity
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
is exerted against all offenses
 
04:25:30.410 --> 04:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
the people are alleged to forget a real
 
04:25:33.830 --> 04:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
distinction in the crimes themselves
 
04:25:36.830 --> 04:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
and to commit the most flagrant
 
04:25:40.130 --> 04:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
with as little compunction as they do
 
04:25:42.349 --> 04:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
the lightest defense
 
04:25:44.410 --> 04:25:44.420 align:start position:0%
the city where he's in the multitude of
 
04:25:46.910 --> 04:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
sanctuary flaws
 
04:25:50.450 --> 04:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
is both in politic and unjust
 
04:25:52.490 --> 04:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
the true design of all punishment being
 
04:25:56.090 --> 04:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
to reform not exterminate mankind
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
so for each reason I ask you to support
 
04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:06.830 --> 04:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:10.309 --> 04:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:12.830 --> 04:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
yeah people definitely want me to want
 
04:26:14.149 --> 04:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
having to mute buttons want to read
 
04:26:16.309 --> 04:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
again in person but um
 
04:26:18.170 --> 04:26:18.180 align:start position:0%
um representative Sylvia could you just
 
04:26:20.630 --> 04:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
brief us on what this is just for one
 
04:26:23.689 --> 04:26:23.699 align:start position:0%
particular crime in RSA 644.9 so could
 
04:26:25.969 --> 04:26:25.979 align:start position:0%
you help a little bit more
 
04:26:28.729 --> 04:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
about that and also can you clarify that
 
04:26:29.929 --> 04:26:29.939 align:start position:0%
the May
 
04:26:32.870 --> 04:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
be May rather than shout that say may
 
04:26:36.110 --> 04:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
rather than shell so that it
 
04:26:37.790 --> 04:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
so as I understand it it would be at the
 
04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
prosecutor's discretion whether or not
 
04:26:40.790 --> 04:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
too late hit the person with a felony
 
04:26:42.410 --> 04:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
charge but the main thing is did you
 
04:26:45.229 --> 04:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
tell us like what specific thing is 6449
 
04:26:45.239 --> 04:26:47.330 align:start position:0%
tell us like what specific thing is 6449
is

04:26:47.330 --> 04:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:26:49.309 --> 04:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
so the
 
04:26:50.929 --> 04:26:50.939 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little bit shaky on the
 
04:26:52.610 --> 04:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
question that it's not coming through
 
04:26:56.269 --> 04:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
the room very well but the crime is
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
invasion of privacy and basically this
 
04:27:00.050 --> 04:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
is peeping Toms and people who put up
 
04:27:02.870 --> 04:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
videos to balance in places where they
 
04:27:05.929 --> 04:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
ought not to or take pictures uh in
 
04:27:08.929 --> 04:27:08.939 align:start position:0%
bathrooms restrooms locker rooms
 
04:27:10.969 --> 04:27:10.979 align:start position:0%
um those sort of things and currently
 
04:27:13.490 --> 04:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
those are misdemeanors and this bill
 
04:27:17.929 --> 04:27:17.939 align:start position:0%
would have a second or consequent uh
 
04:27:17.939 --> 04:27:18.810 align:start position:0%
would have a second or consequent uh
conviction

04:27:18.810 --> 04:27:18.820 align:start position:0%
conviction
 
04:27:18.820 --> 04:27:20.450 align:start position:0%
conviction
[Music]

04:27:20.450 --> 04:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:27:23.689 --> 04:27:23.699 align:start position:0%
um as a felony B which would be a
 
04:27:29.090 --> 04:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:31.550 --> 04:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:27:35.990 --> 04:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:36.000 --> 04:27:39.229 align:start position:0%
 
comments

04:27:39.229 --> 04:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:42.950 --> 04:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:45.410 --> 04:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry can you say the number of the
 
04:27:48.349 --> 04:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
amendment again when I when I had look
 
04:27:50.090 --> 04:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
at that Amendment I'm not seeing this
 
04:27:50.100 --> 04:27:51.349 align:start position:0%
at that Amendment I'm not seeing this
language

04:27:51.349 --> 04:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:28:00.130 --> 04:28:00.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:01.969 --> 04:28:01.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:28:05.210 --> 04:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
I sent those out yesterday that uh
 
04:28:09.050 --> 04:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
like 6 44 pm
 
04:28:10.969 --> 04:28:10.979 align:start position:0%
I got it
 
04:28:10.979 --> 04:28:12.590 align:start position:0%
I got it
I

04:28:12.590 --> 04:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:28:15.710 --> 04:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
can I ask a follow-up
 
04:28:19.490 --> 04:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
when I um when I pull up 1361 from
 
04:28:24.170 --> 04:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
yesterday I see that it deletes part two
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
yes you may be confused by the Amendment
 
04:28:32.710 --> 04:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:35.809 --> 04:28:35.819 align:start position:0%
so the actual bill section two is
 
04:28:41.090 --> 04:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:43.490 --> 04:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
if you read the text of the bill
 
04:28:45.590 --> 04:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
the text of the bill is different than
 
04:28:52.189 --> 04:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:52.199 --> 04:28:55.010 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:28:55.010 --> 04:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:58.790 --> 04:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
chair and uh representative Sylvia I
 
04:29:01.610 --> 04:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear on this because
 
04:29:04.550 --> 04:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
tell you the truth I was a victim of a
 
04:29:04.560 --> 04:29:05.450 align:start position:0%
tell you the truth I was a victim of a
um

04:29:05.450 --> 04:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:09.229 --> 04:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
violation of privacy and it's not a fun
 
04:29:12.410 --> 04:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
thing to happen and are you saying that
 
04:29:15.410 --> 04:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
if we were to Omit this just so unclear
 
04:29:17.870 --> 04:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
that would mean that these people can
 
04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
just keep doing this and having
 
04:29:21.769 --> 04:29:21.779 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors various verses actually
 
04:29:23.929 --> 04:29:23.939 align:start position:0%
seriously being punished for the crimes
 
04:29:26.389 --> 04:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
they're committing
 
04:29:29.269 --> 04:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
so the the current punishment is up to a
 
04:29:32.929 --> 04:29:32.939 align:start position:0%
year in the county jail for each offense
 
04:29:40.370 --> 04:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:44.689 --> 04:29:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:47.990 --> 04:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments
 
04:29:51.889 --> 04:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
yes representative otter thank you and I
 
04:29:54.170 --> 04:29:54.180 align:start position:0%
want to be here what you had to say
 
04:29:56.570 --> 04:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
um so I think my question was about
 
04:29:58.849 --> 04:29:58.859 align:start position:0%
answered too so it's more like a blood
 
04:30:00.889 --> 04:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
pressure in the car like this is
 
04:30:05.269 --> 04:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
different from Excellence actually
 
04:30:07.729 --> 04:30:07.739 align:start position:0%
oh yeah this is definitely not right
 
04:30:07.739 --> 04:30:10.490 align:start position:0%
oh yeah this is definitely not right
foreign

04:30:10.490 --> 04:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:30:13.189 --> 04:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
this is this is invasion of privacy it's
 
04:30:15.889 --> 04:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
not anything there's no physical contact
 
04:30:17.570 --> 04:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
in this at all
 
04:30:21.550 --> 04:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
so this is purely taking pictures video
 
04:30:26.870 --> 04:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:28.790 --> 04:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you
 
04:30:30.110 --> 04:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
chairman I think that's an important
 
04:30:32.030 --> 04:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
distinction that that you raised with
 
04:30:34.670 --> 04:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
your question representative this is not
 
04:30:36.130 --> 04:30:36.140 align:start position:0%
a violent part
 
04:30:39.170 --> 04:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
IES are typically violent crimes things
 
04:30:42.550 --> 04:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
like murder sexual assault kidnapped
 
04:30:45.410 --> 04:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
it's typically physically violent things
 
04:30:48.590 --> 04:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
not always but typically
 
04:30:51.769 --> 04:30:51.779 align:start position:0%
as representative so relatively
 
04:30:54.050 --> 04:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
Expressway and you're in jail it's not a
 
04:31:01.090 --> 04:31:01.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:07.389 --> 04:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:11.570 --> 04:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
representative representative De Lorenzo
 
04:31:12.889 --> 04:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
I have a question for them from
 
04:31:14.990 --> 04:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia you know during
 
04:31:19.130 --> 04:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:22.189 --> 04:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor some questions about
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh a person being convicted of this type
 
04:31:26.990 --> 04:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
of crime
 
04:31:28.910 --> 04:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
um having to register for the sex
 
04:31:31.790 --> 04:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
offender registry and he didn't really
 
04:31:34.849 --> 04:31:34.859 align:start position:0%
have an answer for me so
 
04:31:34.859 --> 04:31:35.990 align:start position:0%
have an answer for me so
um

04:31:35.990 --> 04:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:39.889 --> 04:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia do you think that
 
04:31:39.899 --> 04:31:41.570 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia do you think that
perhaps

04:31:41.570 --> 04:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
04:31:47.389 --> 04:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
SB 95 was drawn up hastily and
 
04:31:52.729 --> 04:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
the elements the elements of this bill
 
04:31:52.739 --> 04:31:54.229 align:start position:0%
the elements the elements of this bill
don't

04:31:54.229 --> 04:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:31:57.830 --> 04:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
need more thought and don't naturally
 
04:32:00.050 --> 04:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
um intersect with the current criminal
 
04:32:00.060 --> 04:32:04.250 align:start position:0%
um intersect with the current criminal
code

04:32:04.250 --> 04:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:07.490 --> 04:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
I guess you make a good point
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
if if we were talking about something
 
04:32:13.969 --> 04:32:13.979 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe that these crimes
 
04:32:16.189 --> 04:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
get somebody into the sex offender
 
04:32:19.570 --> 04:32:19.580 align:start position:0%
registry I'm not I'm not an expert there
 
04:32:22.550 --> 04:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
and perhaps they should but that would
 
04:32:24.830 --> 04:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
be a different build than this bill this
 
04:32:33.710 --> 04:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:36.889 --> 04:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments
 
04:32:38.450 --> 04:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
representative Chase I saw your hand up
 
04:32:39.769 --> 04:32:39.779 align:start position:0%
there for a minute do you have anything
 
04:32:42.050 --> 04:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
else you'd like to say
 
04:32:46.849 --> 04:32:46.859 align:start position:0%
oh well it was more of a a comment that
 
04:32:50.510 --> 04:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
um the people that in my my opinion in
 
04:32:53.510 --> 04:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
in my experience that do this they don't
 
04:32:56.450 --> 04:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
stop and it will escalate and it goes on
 
04:32:59.149 --> 04:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
for years and I think that we should be
 
04:33:02.030 --> 04:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
putting them into jail for the year if
 
04:33:06.250 --> 04:33:06.260 align:start position:0%
that's what our law is stating and um
 
04:33:08.689 --> 04:33:08.699 align:start position:0%
possibly as you said it would be a
 
04:33:12.051 --> 04:33:12.061 align:start position:0%
different bill but maybe after you know
 
04:33:14.631 --> 04:33:14.641 align:start position:0%
two or three times that this gets put in
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
into the sexual register because it does
 
04:33:19.429 --> 04:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
it doesn't stop with the pictures I'm
 
04:33:21.769 --> 04:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
just telling you firsthand but thank you
 
04:33:24.349 --> 04:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
I just needed to say that thank you
 
04:33:26.150 --> 04:33:26.160 align:start position:0%

Amendment with no Amendment Mr Mr chair
 
04:38:39.109 --> 04:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps if representative hargen doesn't
 
04:38:42.470 --> 04:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
know at the moment what he would like to
 
04:38:44.810 --> 04:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
have as his Minority Report could you
 
04:38:46.609 --> 04:38:46.619 align:start position:0%
give him a little time to think about
 
04:38:46.619 --> 04:38:47.750 align:start position:0%
give him a little time to think about

04:38:47.750 --> 04:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:38:52.551 --> 04:38:52.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:55.070 --> 04:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
the other item of business is I'd like
 
04:38:59.209 --> 04:38:59.219 align:start position:0%
to revisit uh Senate Bill 143 if she has
 
04:39:01.510 --> 04:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
not been sent to the clerk's office yet
 
04:39:05.150 --> 04:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
and uh I would like uh to make a motion
 
04:39:08.631 --> 04:39:08.641 align:start position:0%
to reconsider our vote which was ought
 
04:39:12.551 --> 04:39:12.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:17.029 --> 04:39:17.039 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Bryce
 
04:39:17.039 --> 04:39:18.410 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Bryce
and

04:39:18.410 --> 04:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:39:22.789 --> 04:39:22.799 align:start position:0%
all right just to address it uh we were
 
04:39:26.029 --> 04:39:26.039 align:start position:0%
short a member last week I've given a
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
lot of thought to what we didn't end up
 
04:39:29.990 --> 04:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
with last week and I'm concerned that if
 
04:39:31.490 --> 04:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
the bill goes forward in its current
 
04:39:35.810 --> 04:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
form uh that uh it would be unsuccessful
 
04:39:38.810 --> 04:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
and so I would like to read I did vote
 
04:39:40.910 --> 04:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
in the affirmative although I'm told by
 
04:39:42.350 --> 04:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
the clerk's office
 
04:39:45.470 --> 04:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
that doesn't matter uh you don't have to
 
04:39:47.868 --> 04:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
have voted on the prevailence scheme
 
04:39:52.250 --> 04:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:57.288 --> 04:39:57.298 align:start position:0%

04:40:07.730 --> 04:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:09.230 --> 04:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
it's clear if you wanted
 
04:40:09.240 --> 04:40:10.788 align:start position:0%
it's clear if you wanted
to think

04:40:10.788 --> 04:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
to think
 
04:40:14.090 --> 04:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
momentarily seriously we want to keep
 
04:40:19.750 --> 04:40:19.760 align:start position:0%

yeah as as I understand procedurally
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
what that means is we have to go back
 
04:41:42.010 --> 04:41:42.020 align:start position:0%
and vote again on the boat that was
 
04:41:46.550 --> 04:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
taken which was I could pass as amended
 
04:41:48.170 --> 04:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
04:41:51.350 --> 04:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
and that was ought to be as we passed
 
04:41:52.788 --> 04:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
three amendments
 
04:41:56.810 --> 04:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
which was 1252 which deleted part two of

the bill
 
04:42:02.628 --> 04:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
1272 which deleted part 7 of the bill
 
04:42:07.010 --> 04:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
and Amendment 1280 which added an
 
04:42:09.410 --> 04:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
additional charge to the bill offered by
 
04:42:14.708 --> 04:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:14.718 --> 04:42:16.368 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:42:16.368 --> 04:42:16.378 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:16.378 --> 04:42:17.930 align:start position:0%

uh

04:42:17.930 --> 04:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:42:17.940 --> 04:42:20.448 align:start position:0%
uh
so

04:42:20.448 --> 04:42:20.458 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:42:23.690 --> 04:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
what we would be in taking this vote
 
04:42:23.700 --> 04:42:25.330 align:start position:0%
what we would be in taking this vote
were

04:42:25.330 --> 04:42:25.340 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:42:28.610 --> 04:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
this is a vote on the same boat that we
 
04:42:30.110 --> 04:42:30.120 align:start position:0%

04:46:48.650 --> 04:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
Amendment does four things uh it deals
 
04:46:50.270 --> 04:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
first of all it deals with part one of
 
04:46:51.530 --> 04:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:46:54.050 --> 04:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
which we we considered last time pretty
 
04:46:54.060 --> 04:46:55.788 align:start position:0%
which we we considered last time pretty
extensively

04:46:55.788 --> 04:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
extensively
 
04:46:58.788 --> 04:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
like the way it's current part one is
 
04:47:02.868 --> 04:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
currently written is in large part uh
 
04:47:04.730 --> 04:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
very similar to what we previously
 
04:47:07.788 --> 04:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
passed in this body
 
04:47:07.798 --> 04:47:09.050 align:start position:0%
passed in this body
and

04:47:09.050 --> 04:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:11.930 --> 04:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
uh went to um
 
04:47:16.010 --> 04:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
was previously passed and was tabled by
 
04:47:18.470 --> 04:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:20.208 --> 04:47:20.218 align:start position:0%
at session
 
04:47:20.218 --> 04:47:21.470 align:start position:0%
at session
this

04:47:21.470 --> 04:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:47:24.470 --> 04:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
takes out some things which I certainly
 
04:47:27.170 --> 04:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
would like to see happen I know most of
 
04:47:29.270 --> 04:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
us would like to see happen
 
04:47:33.350 --> 04:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
but uh if what it does is it keeps in I
 
04:47:35.090 --> 04:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
think what is the most important part
 
04:47:39.110 --> 04:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
and that is getting kids counsel at the
 
04:47:42.410 --> 04:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
very initiation of the court process the
 
04:47:44.930 --> 04:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
delinquency process
 
04:47:46.390 --> 04:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:47:49.128 --> 04:47:49.138 align:start position:0%
doesn't permit them to waive Council
 
04:47:50.890 --> 04:47:50.900 align:start position:0%
they have to have
 
04:47:53.570 --> 04:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
circumstances I like that
 
04:47:53.580 --> 04:47:55.610 align:start position:0%
circumstances I like that
and

04:47:55.610 --> 04:47:55.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:58.550 --> 04:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
it also deals with the issue of contract
 
04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
attorneys in that the way contract
 
04:48:04.010 --> 04:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
attorneys are currently paid if there's
 
04:48:05.868 --> 04:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
a disincentive for them to become
 
04:48:08.090 --> 04:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
extensively involved in representing
 
04:48:11.390 --> 04:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
juveniles and this does away with that
 
04:48:14.330 --> 04:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
system it allows them to be paid fairly
 
04:48:17.690 --> 04:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
quick form and will provide them with a
 
04:48:20.510 --> 04:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
greater Ascent incentive for them to
 
04:48:22.610 --> 04:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
provide quality representation for
 
04:48:22.620 --> 04:48:23.750 align:start position:0%
provide quality representation for
juveniles

04:48:23.750 --> 04:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
juveniles
 
04:48:26.868 --> 04:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
and the last thing it does is it sets
 
04:48:26.878 --> 04:48:28.510 align:start position:0%
and the last thing it does is it sets
forth

04:48:28.510 --> 04:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
forth
 
04:48:31.368 --> 04:48:31.378 align:start position:0%
requirement that the
 
04:48:34.610 --> 04:48:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
04:48:38.110 --> 04:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
there be standards established
 
04:48:40.750 --> 04:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
with four
 
04:48:43.550 --> 04:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
these uh relative to appointment for
 
04:48:45.948 --> 04:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
juvenile counseling these all came out
 
04:48:49.208 --> 04:48:49.218 align:start position:0%
of a recommendations that have been made
 
04:48:53.390 --> 04:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh I know it falls short of what many
 
04:48:55.430 --> 04:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
people would like to have happen and
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
what they expect but I think we all saw
 
04:49:00.550 --> 04:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
what happened on the floor in uh
 
04:49:05.270 --> 04:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
previously and the exception that some
 
04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
other Representatives took to what was
 
04:49:09.350 --> 04:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
proposed at a time and I'm concerned
 
04:49:11.868 --> 04:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
that if we go much further than what is
 
04:49:14.990 --> 04:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
offered here that but effectively just
 
04:49:16.788 --> 04:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
going to kill them
 
04:49:19.910 --> 04:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
the other thing that the uh Amendment
 
04:49:24.170 --> 04:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
does is it deletes other parts of
 
04:49:26.628 --> 04:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 143.
 
04:49:30.230 --> 04:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
that don't delete
 
04:49:32.990 --> 04:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh part
 
04:49:33.000 --> 04:49:39.230 align:start position:0%
uh part
10.

04:49:39.230 --> 04:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:41.690 --> 04:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
with regard to appeals of the victims
 
04:49:44.150 --> 04:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
assistance commission and this is kind
 
04:49:47.628 --> 04:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
of interesting kind of and frankly I um
 
04:49:49.550 --> 04:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure we got very good testimony
 
04:49:52.310 --> 04:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
about this but with regard to that there
 
04:49:56.150 --> 04:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
is a committee which is set up for to
 
04:49:58.788 --> 04:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
provide to manage the victims assistance
 
04:49:58.798 --> 04:50:00.288 align:start position:0%
provide to manage the victims assistance
fund

04:50:00.288 --> 04:50:00.298 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:50:03.230 --> 04:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
and that commission is set up for the
 
04:50:05.030 --> 04:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
very purpose of determining what's fair
 
04:50:08.990 --> 04:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
and appropriate for uh a financial
 
04:50:12.050 --> 04:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
benefit for remuneration for for victims
 
04:50:14.448 --> 04:50:14.458 align:start position:0%
but the way this is written it basically
 
04:50:16.730 --> 04:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
says that if you don't like the outcome
 
04:50:19.788 --> 04:50:19.798 align:start position:0%
you can go to the attorney general and
 
04:50:23.090 --> 04:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General can just overrule
 
04:50:26.050 --> 04:50:26.060 align:start position:0%
the victims assistance Council
 
04:50:30.350 --> 04:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
that in effect you're making the
 
04:50:33.170 --> 04:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
attorney general the ultimate decision
 
04:50:37.010 --> 04:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
maker as to who gets money and if that's
 
04:50:38.990 --> 04:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
the case there's really no purpose at
 
04:50:41.448 --> 04:50:41.458 align:start position:0%
all for having the victims and
 
04:50:43.750 --> 04:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
assistance Commission
 
04:50:45.890 --> 04:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense at all if the
 
04:50:47.690 --> 04:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
Attorney General can do it anyway and
 
04:50:50.150 --> 04:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
then you can appeal right now if you
 
04:50:52.250 --> 04:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
don't like the victims assistance fund
 
04:50:53.810 --> 04:50:53.820 align:start position:0%
you will just appeal to the Supreme
 
04:50:56.448 --> 04:50:56.458 align:start position:0%
Court and I just don't think it makes
 
04:50:59.448 --> 04:50:59.458 align:start position:0%
any sense to do that
 
04:51:01.970 --> 04:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
with regard to the the other Provisions
 
04:51:04.730 --> 04:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
it also deletes part nine regard to
 
04:51:06.530 --> 04:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
relative emergency
 
04:51:10.010 --> 04:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
medical data and Trauma services and I
 
04:51:12.470 --> 04:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
think that the testimony we got first of
 
04:51:13.788 --> 04:51:13.798 align:start position:0%
all I think
 
04:51:15.830 --> 04:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
my recollection was that Senator Carson
 
04:51:17.330 --> 04:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
said that she thought that needed to be
 
04:51:18.830 --> 04:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
amended in any event
 
04:51:20.810 --> 04:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
but basically
 
04:51:23.868 --> 04:51:23.878 align:start position:0%
it allows sharing of personal
 
04:51:23.878 --> 04:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
it allows sharing of personal
information

04:51:25.140 --> 04:51:25.150 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:51:25.150 --> 04:51:26.448 align:start position:0%
information
[Music]

04:51:26.448 --> 04:51:26.458 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
that would ordinarily be considered
 
04:51:28.440 --> 04:51:30.050 align:start position:0%
that would ordinarily be considered
confidential

04:51:30.050 --> 04:51:30.060 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
04:51:32.650 --> 04:51:32.660 align:start position:0%
and I think it it
 
04:51:36.470 --> 04:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's contrary to what we have considered
 
04:51:38.510 --> 04:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
in the past is concerns for our
 
04:51:40.788 --> 04:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
individual privacy
 
04:51:44.270 --> 04:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
and the it also removes
 
04:51:47.448 --> 04:51:47.458 align:start position:0%
Section 8 and
 
04:51:51.470 --> 04:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
which has to do with cyber security and
 
04:51:53.628 --> 04:51:53.638 align:start position:0%
if you remember the testimony basically
 
04:51:55.490 --> 04:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
what this was doing was requiring
 
04:51:58.310 --> 04:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions to report cyber
 
04:52:00.230 --> 04:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
security incidents
 
04:52:03.410 --> 04:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
to a cyber integration Center
 
04:52:05.208 --> 04:52:05.218 align:start position:0%
established by the department of
 
04:52:08.150 --> 04:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
information technology which I'll I'll
 
04:52:11.330 --> 04:52:11.340 align:start position:0%
just give concern to me with regard to
 
04:52:13.070 --> 04:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
the establishment of some type of secret
 
04:52:15.170 --> 04:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
intelligence agency you know when I hear
 
04:52:18.350 --> 04:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
those words uh in terms of collecting
 
04:52:20.628 --> 04:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
information again collecting information
 
04:52:25.250 --> 04:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
about uh to people and again a concern
 
04:52:28.970 --> 04:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
again for privacy from my perspective so
 
04:52:31.150 --> 04:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
long in the short in a men's part one
 
04:52:34.190 --> 04:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
deletes Parts eight nine and ten and
 
04:52:36.650 --> 04:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of the amendment
 
04:52:38.330 --> 04:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
04:52:40.910 --> 04:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you very much for that
 
04:52:44.628 --> 04:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
explanation on Mr chair so am I to
 
04:52:48.830 --> 04:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
assume that contrary to the very strong
 
04:52:48.840 --> 04:52:50.110 align:start position:0%
assume that contrary to the very strong
vote

04:52:50.110 --> 04:52:50.120 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:52:54.288 --> 04:52:54.298 align:start position:0%
bipartisan vote on the elimination of
 
04:52:58.970 --> 04:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
part two that we voted on that you have
 
04:53:02.390 --> 04:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
concluded that you want to keep part two
 
04:53:04.250 --> 04:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
04:53:09.650 --> 04:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
you are included uh inaccurately part we
 
04:53:11.930 --> 04:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
that Amendment uh that you made
 
04:53:14.448 --> 04:53:14.458 align:start position:0%
previously remains in effect
 
04:53:17.690 --> 04:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
and part two is deleted
 
04:53:20.868 --> 04:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair could you explain how that
 
04:53:25.128 --> 04:53:25.138 align:start position:0%
could be since what we have done here
 
04:53:29.708 --> 04:53:29.718 align:start position:0%
is eliminate our final vote
 
04:53:34.368 --> 04:53:34.378 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 143
 
04:53:38.150 --> 04:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
um uh first we we agreed to reconsider
 
04:53:40.990 --> 04:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
then we agreed to eliminate that vote
 
04:53:45.770 --> 04:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
then we went back to the beginning
 
04:53:49.128 --> 04:53:49.138 align:start position:0%
and going back to the beginning had
 
04:53:55.208 --> 04:53:55.218 align:start position:0%
section two in it and so I'm not clear
 
04:54:00.410 --> 04:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
how we can pick and choose and say We'll
 
04:54:04.250 --> 04:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
honor the removal of two but we won't
 
04:54:04.260 --> 04:54:05.690 align:start position:0%
honor the removal of two but we won't
honor

04:54:05.690 --> 04:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
honor
 
04:54:09.350 --> 04:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
the removal of other sections which we
 
04:54:12.288 --> 04:54:12.298 align:start position:0%
had in fact voted on last time
 
04:54:15.288 --> 04:54:15.298 align:start position:0%
well this is my understanding and this
 
04:54:18.310 --> 04:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
is only after uh talking with the clerk
 
04:54:20.948 --> 04:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
uh and that is
 
04:54:25.070 --> 04:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
when we we ended the we voted to
 
04:54:25.080 --> 04:54:26.690 align:start position:0%
when we we ended the we voted to
reconsider

04:54:26.690 --> 04:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
reconsider
 
04:54:28.610 --> 04:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
when you vote to reconsider what you're
 
04:54:30.830 --> 04:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
doing is voting to reconsider the vote
 
04:54:34.670 --> 04:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
we took of ought to pass as Amendment
 
04:54:38.030 --> 04:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
with the Amendments that we had voted on
 
04:54:43.310 --> 04:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
we voted so we decided we went if we had
 
04:54:45.050 --> 04:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
voted yes on that
 
04:54:47.570 --> 04:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
then we would be done today
 
04:54:52.670 --> 04:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
but uh having voted no on that what that
 
04:54:54.830 --> 04:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
does is it opens up
 
04:54:58.730 --> 04:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
the bill for a further Amendment the
 
04:55:00.830 --> 04:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
Amendments that were already passed
 
04:55:03.948 --> 04:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
remain in effect so
 
04:55:07.610 --> 04:55:07.620 align:start position:0%
the Amendments 1252 which was the
 
04:55:09.830 --> 04:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
amendment for part two the amen the
 
04:55:13.610 --> 04:55:13.620 align:start position:0%
amendment 1272 with regard to part seven
 
04:55:17.030 --> 04:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
and the additional part which was added
 
04:55:20.390 --> 04:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
in Amendment 1280 still remain in effect
 
04:55:26.150 --> 04:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:26.160 --> 04:55:27.590 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:55:27.590 --> 04:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:55:31.390 --> 04:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
chair I would never question
 
04:55:35.628 --> 04:55:35.638 align:start position:0%
your decision I tend to be about and
 
04:55:38.690 --> 04:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
suspend a person I like to be really
 
04:55:41.810 --> 04:55:41.820 align:start position:0%
sure but with your
 
04:55:46.610 --> 04:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
um very strong statement I believe that
 
04:55:49.550 --> 04:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
I can certainly accept that and when the
 
04:55:52.190 --> 04:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
calendar comes out and in the fullness
 
04:55:55.610 --> 04:55:55.620 align:start position:0%
of time the distinguished clerk has the
 
04:55:55.620 --> 04:55:56.990 align:start position:0%
of time the distinguished clerk has the
language

04:55:56.990 --> 04:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:55:58.850 --> 04:55:58.860 align:start position:0%
in it
 
04:56:04.090 --> 04:56:04.100 align:start position:0%
um if perhaps it turns out that
 
04:56:08.330 --> 04:56:08.340 align:start position:0%
my concern might be justified I
 
04:56:10.990 --> 04:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
certainly hope that the committee
 
04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
will step up
 
04:56:16.128 --> 04:56:16.138 align:start position:0%
to correct that problem
 
04:56:19.850 --> 04:56:19.860 align:start position:0%
if if it would ease your concern I would
 
04:56:23.990 --> 04:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
be happy to expand my emotion to include
 
04:56:30.110 --> 04:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:36.890 --> 04:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
here my concern is so enormous
 
04:56:41.390 --> 04:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
that I can't possibly ask you to assume
 
04:56:45.350 --> 04:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
any of that burden it would be unfair
 
04:56:49.730 --> 04:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:53.448 --> 04:56:53.458 align:start position:0%
I I might be totally off base and I'm
 
04:56:55.368 --> 04:56:55.378 align:start position:0%
perfectly willing to acknowledge that I
 
04:56:57.890 --> 04:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that if in the
 
04:57:01.310 --> 04:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
fullness of time I'm not off base
 
04:57:03.948 --> 04:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
that there will be an opportunity to
 
04:57:05.770 --> 04:57:05.780 align:start position:0%
correct the misunderstanding
 
04:57:08.270 --> 04:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I don't want to
 
04:57:09.730 --> 04:57:09.740 align:start position:0%
screw up so
 
04:57:14.570 --> 04:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
if if what I'm more than happy to do is
 
04:57:19.430 --> 04:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
to uh have a since I the
 
04:57:22.310 --> 04:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
although we weren't in full agreement we
 
04:57:24.170 --> 04:57:24.180 align:start position:0%
were in substantial agreement on those
 
04:57:26.990 --> 04:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
three other amendments I'd be more than
 
04:57:29.050 --> 04:57:29.060 align:start position:0%
happy to either
 
04:57:32.448 --> 04:57:32.458 align:start position:0%
it probably isn't fair to include them
 
04:57:34.190 --> 04:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
in my Amendment because there may be
 
04:57:36.230 --> 04:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
people that feel differently about that
 
04:57:38.990 --> 04:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
but I'd be more than happy after we vote
 
04:57:41.208 --> 04:57:41.218 align:start position:0%
on the amendment that I've just offered
 
04:57:45.530 --> 04:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
to go back and make a motion that uh we
 
04:57:49.010 --> 04:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
also approve those three other again
 
04:57:51.530 --> 04:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
uh we reaffirm our decision on those
 
04:57:54.530 --> 04:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
three other amendments so well that's
 
04:57:57.410 --> 04:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
very kind of you Mr chair just as you
 
04:58:00.410 --> 04:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
very clearly acknowledged that you
 
04:58:04.970 --> 04:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
thought that your new part one does not
 
04:58:08.270 --> 04:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
go as far as you would like to see it go
 
04:58:12.050 --> 04:58:12.060 align:start position:0%
but nonetheless recognizing that there
 
04:58:14.628 --> 04:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
might be others out there who would
 
04:58:17.990 --> 04:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
choose to block the entire Bill you're
 
04:58:23.208 --> 04:58:23.218 align:start position:0%
compromising so too I compromise and I
 
04:58:26.868 --> 04:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
recognize that elections
 
04:58:30.410 --> 04:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
um matter and I am in the minority and I
 
04:58:32.448 --> 04:58:32.458 align:start position:0%
do not want to
 
04:58:32.458 --> 04:58:35.330 align:start position:0%
do not want to
um

04:58:35.330 --> 04:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:38.350 --> 04:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
I do not want to take the chance of
 
04:58:41.390 --> 04:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
antagonizing any of those who were in
 
04:58:44.868 --> 04:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
The majority and might consider this the
 
04:58:46.850 --> 04:58:46.860 align:start position:0%
word I believe that is used is a
 
04:58:46.860 --> 04:58:48.230 align:start position:0%
word I believe that is used is a
dilatory

04:58:48.230 --> 04:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
dilatory
 
04:58:52.150 --> 04:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
conversation so I would just abandon
 
04:58:54.288 --> 04:58:54.298 align:start position:0%
abandon the field
 
04:59:05.530 --> 04:59:05.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:08.208 --> 04:59:08.218 align:start position:0%
that would go a lot quicker than adding
 
04:59:10.310 --> 04:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
three more roll call votes on amendments
 
04:59:14.930 --> 04:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
of the the reason that the yeah the
 
04:59:16.730 --> 04:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
reason that the clerk ruled the way he
 
04:59:16.740 --> 04:59:17.628 align:start position:0%
reason that the clerk ruled the way he
did

04:59:17.628 --> 04:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
did
 
04:59:20.990 --> 04:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
um representative Smith is because by
 
04:59:23.868 --> 04:59:23.878 align:start position:0%
reconsidering we ought to pass the other
 
04:59:26.448 --> 04:59:26.458 align:start position:0%
amendments were separate votes so we
 
04:59:28.490 --> 04:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
didn't reconsider the separate boats
 
04:59:33.050 --> 04:59:33.060 align:start position:0%
that we took on 1252 1272 1280. so by
 
04:59:35.690 --> 04:59:35.700 align:start position:0%
reconsidering that ought to pass if we
 
04:59:39.170 --> 04:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
wanted to then get rid of 1252 we would
 
04:59:42.948 --> 04:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
have to also vote to reconsider 1252 so
 
04:59:45.530 --> 04:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
that is the reason the 1252 stays in
 
04:59:49.368 --> 04:59:49.378 align:start position:0%
effect 1272 stays in effect at 1280 stay
 
04:59:52.128 --> 04:59:52.138 align:start position:0%
in effect in order to remove those we
 
04:59:53.810 --> 04:59:53.820 align:start position:0%
would have had to have had three
 
04:59:56.868 --> 04:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
subsequent votes and so that that is why
 
04:59:59.330 --> 04:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
um the chair was comfortable in making
 
05:00:01.788 --> 05:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
the the assertion that he made
 
05:00:08.690 --> 05:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:13.190 --> 05:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
okay so we're back to the amendment 1378
 
05:00:15.170 --> 05:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
is there any other yes representative
 
05:00:15.180 --> 05:00:17.208 align:start position:0%
is there any other yes representative
Burge

05:00:17.208 --> 05:00:17.218 align:start position:0%
Burge
 
05:00:17.218 --> 05:00:18.470 align:start position:0%
Burge
foreign

05:00:18.470 --> 05:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:00:20.868 --> 05:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:00:25.810 --> 05:00:25.820 align:start position:0%
uh I too can can do math and understand
 
05:00:29.330 --> 05:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
uh a good particle let's discuss as well
 
05:00:29.340 --> 05:00:29.990 align:start position:0%
uh a good particle let's discuss as well
as

05:00:29.990 --> 05:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:00:33.010 --> 05:00:33.020 align:start position:0%
I understand very well the the chairs
 
05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
comments on why he was putting forth uh
 
05:00:38.868 --> 05:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
05:00:38.878 --> 05:00:40.670 align:start position:0%
this amendment
um

05:00:40.670 --> 05:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:44.030 --> 05:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
given my sense of numbers I basically
 
05:00:45.708 --> 05:00:45.718 align:start position:0%
want to make some comments about the
 
05:00:49.368 --> 05:00:49.378 align:start position:0%
overall situation and then the chips
 
05:00:52.490 --> 05:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
will fall where the chips May I was
 
05:00:52.500 --> 05:00:53.868 align:start position:0%
will fall where the chips May I was
hopeful

05:00:53.868 --> 05:00:53.878 align:start position:0%
hopeful
 
05:00:56.208 --> 05:00:56.218 align:start position:0%
that this would not
 
05:01:00.288 --> 05:01:00.298 align:start position:0%
be a team red versus Team blue uh type
 
05:01:02.868 --> 05:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
of situation but sometimes it happens
 
05:01:05.208 --> 05:01:05.218 align:start position:0%
it's in the nature of the work that we
 
05:01:08.690 --> 05:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
do but I think we should forget that
 
05:01:11.090 --> 05:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
these are not only children we're
 
05:01:13.190 --> 05:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
talking about our children our neighbors
 
05:01:15.650 --> 05:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
children but we're talking about
 
05:01:17.868 --> 05:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
Indigent children and if you want to
 
05:01:19.970 --> 05:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
know a group that has very little voting
 
05:01:23.150 --> 05:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
power that's Indigent children I mean
 
05:01:25.490 --> 05:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
even adult criminals have more of a
 
05:01:29.410 --> 05:01:29.420 align:start position:0%
voting power than Indigent children
 
05:01:33.948 --> 05:01:33.958 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to keep that focused
 
05:01:36.650 --> 05:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
um this bill
 
05:01:41.570 --> 05:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:44.090 --> 05:01:44.100 align:start position:0%
I'm likely with
 
05:01:47.090 --> 05:01:47.100 align:start position:0%
considerable regret to vote for
 
05:01:51.650 --> 05:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
uh under a feeling that it moves
 
05:01:53.628 --> 05:01:53.638 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:01:56.510 --> 05:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
the effort for improving our Juvenile
 
05:01:59.810 --> 05:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
Justice System a smidgen forward
 
05:02:02.690 --> 05:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
but I want to
 
05:02:04.310 --> 05:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't know whether it's easing my
 
05:02:07.850 --> 05:02:07.860 align:start position:0%
conscience or uh doing part of my
 
05:02:10.250 --> 05:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
education to
 
05:02:13.310 --> 05:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
also make it clear here on the record
 
05:02:15.350 --> 05:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
such as we keep
 
05:02:18.110 --> 05:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
how much we're not doing here
 
05:02:20.810 --> 05:02:20.820 align:start position:0%
and I really want to encourage people to
 
05:02:23.208 --> 05:02:23.218 align:start position:0%
read the report that was done by the
 
05:02:26.750 --> 05:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
independent Consulting Group because 98
 
05:02:29.650 --> 05:02:29.660 align:start position:0%
of that is not being followed
 
05:02:29.660 --> 05:02:31.250 align:start position:0%
of that is not being followed
and

05:02:31.250 --> 05:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:02:34.030 --> 05:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
um it may be true this is all we can get
 
05:02:38.110 --> 05:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire has a way they say of
 
05:02:41.570 --> 05:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
legislating through the court system
 
05:02:44.868 --> 05:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
uh today the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
05:02:48.650 --> 05:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
just ruled in fact that uh it's improper
 
05:02:51.948 --> 05:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
to keep uh mental health people people
 
05:02:54.590 --> 05:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
in mental health emergencies more than
 
05:02:57.288 --> 05:02:57.298 align:start position:0%
three days without uh due process type
 
05:03:00.708 --> 05:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
hearing uh remarking that this is
 
05:03:02.150 --> 05:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
something the legislature could well
 
05:03:04.190 --> 05:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
have taken care of and well could take
 
05:03:05.810 --> 05:03:05.820 align:start position:0%
care of but didn't
 
05:03:08.448 --> 05:03:08.458 align:start position:0%
so the mental health system not for the
 
05:03:11.330 --> 05:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
first time has had to go to court to get
 
05:03:14.810 --> 05:03:14.820 align:start position:0%
some basic uh help done and it may be
 
05:03:16.610 --> 05:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
that the juvenile justice system will
 
05:03:20.448 --> 05:03:20.458 align:start position:0%
have to go to court to get uh necessary
 
05:03:23.448 --> 05:03:23.458 align:start position:0%
reforms done but then we run into the
 
05:03:28.010 --> 05:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
problem of the kids don't have effective
 
05:03:30.410 --> 05:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
legal representation
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
so the ability to get to court and the
 
05:03:39.050 --> 05:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
like uh effectively doesn't work the uh
 
05:03:41.890 --> 05:03:41.900 align:start position:0%
the amendment in front of us
 
05:03:44.390 --> 05:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
deletes the requirement
 
05:03:46.970 --> 05:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
that juveniles be represented during the
 
05:03:49.730 --> 05:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
entire time the juveniles in the system
 
05:03:54.170 --> 05:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:58.010 --> 05:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
the right to counsel and interrogation
 
05:04:00.590 --> 05:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
for to be put formally in the law has
 
05:04:03.230 --> 05:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
been removed it can be argued that that
 
05:04:06.430 --> 05:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
exists anyway as a function of Miranda
 
05:04:09.230 --> 05:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
but what we have seen in practice is
 
05:04:12.948 --> 05:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
that it basically doesn't exist uh
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
because lawyers are not litigating that
 
05:04:15.840 --> 05:04:17.690 align:start position:0%
because lawyers are not litigating that
issue

05:04:17.690 --> 05:04:17.700 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:04:21.170 --> 05:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
um the elimination of fees
 
05:04:22.930 --> 05:04:22.940 align:start position:0%
for publicly
 
05:04:27.708 --> 05:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
appointed counsel that's been eliminated
 
05:04:30.590 --> 05:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
the overall suggestion from a report is
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
that fees throughout the juvenile system
 
05:04:37.010 --> 05:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
not be attributed to uh children and
 
05:04:40.550 --> 05:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
their parents because the kids don't get
 
05:04:43.430 --> 05:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
access to those because they can't pay
 
05:04:47.690 --> 05:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
in our state they pay for appeals well
 
05:04:50.570 --> 05:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
or a portion of appeals there's a reason
 
05:04:53.270 --> 05:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
we have five appeals in six years when
 
05:04:56.570 --> 05:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of cases
 
05:04:59.330 --> 05:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
we basically don't have appeals in
 
05:05:03.230 --> 05:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
juvenile cases in this state
 
05:05:05.330 --> 05:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
motion work whatever
 
05:05:08.150 --> 05:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
so we thought we would attempt to do the
 
05:05:11.110 --> 05:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
smallest part possible which is to say
 
05:05:14.750 --> 05:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
we'll leave in the cost of appeals we'll
 
05:05:17.330 --> 05:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
leave in the cost of of out of home
 
05:05:20.090 --> 05:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
placement we'll leave in the cost to the
 
05:05:22.788 --> 05:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
parents of counseling we'll just say the
 
05:05:24.708 --> 05:05:24.718 align:start position:0%
right to a lawyer
 
05:05:27.770 --> 05:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
should fall on the child and the parents
 
05:05:31.250 --> 05:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
but that's been deleted too
 
05:05:34.010 --> 05:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
um the use of counsel for out of home
 
05:05:36.708 --> 05:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
placements been deleted
 
05:05:36.718 --> 05:05:38.690 align:start position:0%
placements been deleted
so

05:05:38.690 --> 05:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:05:40.730 --> 05:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
we're not getting a whole lot of here
 
05:05:43.250 --> 05:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm hopeful that maybe in future
 
05:05:46.788 --> 05:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
years we can and I hope by passing this
 
05:05:49.610 --> 05:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take the steam out of
 
05:05:53.330 --> 05:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
energy to do more because uh in this day
 
05:05:55.730 --> 05:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
we need to do more and I think the
 
05:05:58.430 --> 05:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
legislature has as much of an obligation
 
05:06:01.190 --> 05:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
to do that as the court system does
 
05:06:01.200 --> 05:06:02.390 align:start position:0%
to do that as the court system does
but

05:06:02.390 --> 05:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:06:04.850 --> 05:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
I've been reasonably well advised by
 
05:06:06.708 --> 05:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
people who work on a day-to-day basis
 
05:06:10.250 --> 05:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
that as our chair has pointed out this
 
05:06:12.830 --> 05:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
does move the ball forward to some
 
05:06:16.610 --> 05:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
degree especially in getting counsel uh
 
05:06:16.620 --> 05:06:18.128 align:start position:0%
degree especially in getting counsel uh
sooner

05:06:18.128 --> 05:06:18.138 align:start position:0%
sooner
 
05:06:22.128 --> 05:06:22.138 align:start position:0%
uh and for that reason I intend to vote
 
05:06:27.830 --> 05:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:31.670 --> 05:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
 
05:06:31.680 --> 05:06:33.470 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
um

05:06:33.470 --> 05:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:34.970 --> 05:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna lie I'm a little
 
05:06:34.980 --> 05:06:36.288 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna lie I'm a little
disappointed

05:06:36.288 --> 05:06:36.298 align:start position:0%
disappointed
 
05:06:38.810 --> 05:06:38.820 align:start position:0%
but um because I
 
05:06:42.170 --> 05:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
I am a you know a big believer in these
 
05:06:45.230 --> 05:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
kids getting counsel as soon as possible
 
05:06:45.240 --> 05:06:46.788 align:start position:0%
kids getting counsel as soon as possible
but

05:06:46.788 --> 05:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:06:49.010 --> 05:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
in the interest of taking what I can get
 
05:06:51.350 --> 05:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
and baby steps to get to the ultimate
 
05:06:53.208 --> 05:06:53.218 align:start position:0%
goal I will be
 
05:06:55.850 --> 05:06:55.860 align:start position:0%
um supporting this amendment because I
 
05:06:57.530 --> 05:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
certainly did not want to take a chance
 
05:06:59.448 --> 05:06:59.458 align:start position:0%
that it will
 
05:07:01.970 --> 05:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
um die on the house floor
 
05:07:05.930 --> 05:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:09.110 --> 05:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
well and what else
 
05:07:11.530 --> 05:07:11.540 align:start position:0%
the the only point I'd make and
 
05:07:14.510 --> 05:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that comes with being 73
 
05:07:16.490 --> 05:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
years old
 
05:07:19.368 --> 05:07:19.378 align:start position:0%
having been in the legislature before is
 
05:07:21.788 --> 05:07:21.798 align:start position:0%
I'm well aware of the fact that
 
05:07:24.470 --> 05:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
change doesn't usually happen
 
05:07:27.350 --> 05:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
dramatically here at the legislature
 
05:07:30.288 --> 05:07:30.298 align:start position:0%
generally happens over time
 
05:07:32.390 --> 05:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
it happens dramatically in the courts
 
05:07:34.190 --> 05:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
just like the decision might have been
 
05:07:35.330 --> 05:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
made today
 
05:07:37.730 --> 05:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't happen that way usually
 
05:07:39.830 --> 05:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
in the legislature it happens
 
05:07:42.590 --> 05:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
incrementally over time and the way I
 
05:07:46.128 --> 05:07:46.138 align:start position:0%
see this is this is a step forward it
 
05:07:47.930 --> 05:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
gets the basic thing that we were
 
05:07:50.948 --> 05:07:50.958 align:start position:0%
looking for in regard to getting
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
immediate and full representation of
 
05:07:58.788 --> 05:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
kids and and we have the opportunity to
 
05:08:00.410 --> 05:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
bring forward the other things in the
 
05:08:05.948 --> 05:08:05.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:08.628 --> 05:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
certainly look forward to that
 
05:08:11.750 --> 05:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'm disappointed too but I'm also
 
05:08:18.350 --> 05:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%

05:12:43.610 --> 05:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
will exec
 
05:12:46.810 --> 05:12:46.820 align:start position:0%

05:12:56.990 --> 05:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
morning gonna be immediately thereafter
 
05:13:00.590 --> 05:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for clarifying it we
 
05:13:05.570 --> 05:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:15.970 --> 05:13:15.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:18.350 --> 05:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
any other business today yes
 
05:13:23.650 --> 05:13:23.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:27.650 --> 05:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
05:13:27.660 --> 05:13:30.410 align:start position:0%
yeah I
uh

05:13:30.410 --> 05:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:13:33.890 --> 05:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
I sent out an email asking people uh if
 
05:13:35.868 --> 05:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
they wanted to participate I guess I
 
05:13:38.270 --> 05:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
think three responses for people who
 
05:13:41.090 --> 05:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
indicated that they were interested in a
 
05:13:42.770 --> 05:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
05:13:47.270 --> 05:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh so I when several of the retained
 
05:13:49.010 --> 05:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
bills I think have been addressed
 
05:13:50.330 --> 05:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
separately and I think they're going to
 
05:13:53.810 --> 05:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:54.948 --> 05:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
but I
 
05:14:01.730 --> 05:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:04.730 --> 05:14:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:06.530 --> 05:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
um I want if
 
05:14:09.410 --> 05:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
you will indulge me I want to go back to
 
05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
something that was part of conversation
 
05:14:15.410 --> 05:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
on an earlier Bill about
 
05:14:15.420 --> 05:14:16.070 align:start position:0%
on an earlier Bill about
um

05:14:16.070 --> 05:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:16.080 --> 05:14:18.470 align:start position:0%
um
inappropriate

05:14:18.470 --> 05:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
05:14:18.480 --> 05:14:20.050 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
um

05:14:20.050 --> 05:14:20.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:23.150 --> 05:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
actions that have happened in other
 
05:14:23.160 --> 05:14:24.730 align:start position:0%
actions that have happened in other
committees

05:14:24.730 --> 05:14:24.740 align:start position:0%
committees
 
05:14:28.310 --> 05:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
there have been inappropriate actions
 
05:14:30.650 --> 05:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
there have been really
 
05:14:33.708 --> 05:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
not just minor problems but some
 
05:14:39.910 --> 05:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
shocking problems and I would like to uh
 
05:14:43.610 --> 05:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
say that I believe the reason that has
 
05:14:46.910 --> 05:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
not occurred in this committee
 
05:14:49.930 --> 05:14:49.940 align:start position:0%
is because of
 
05:14:52.850 --> 05:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
the the
 
05:14:56.330 --> 05:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
way you have conducted the committee as
 
05:15:00.288 --> 05:15:00.298 align:start position:0%
you can see you certainly by today you
 
05:15:02.990 --> 05:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
certainly didn't bend over backwards to
 
05:15:05.330 --> 05:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
accommodate those of us who are
 
05:15:10.570 --> 05:15:10.580 align:start position:0%
Democrats but what you did do was behave
 
05:15:15.350 --> 05:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
consistently in a responsible respectful
 
05:15:20.030 --> 05:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
way and we are indeed fortunate to have
 
05:15:22.850 --> 05:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
had that experience rather than the
 
05:15:25.850 --> 05:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
experience that some of our colleagues
 
05:15:25.860 --> 05:15:27.170 align:start position:0%
experience that some of our colleagues
have

05:15:27.170 --> 05:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
have
