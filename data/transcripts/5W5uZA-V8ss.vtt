00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
well the issue is just hearing people um
 
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
and whoever out there in the ether may
 
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
or may not hear me will
 
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
just restrain ourselves as to our
 
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.910 align:start position:0%
just restrain ourselves as to our
conversation

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.750 align:start position:0%
conversation
but

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
where did i put this one
 
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
where did i put this
 
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
i am opening the subcommittee meeting on
 
00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 align:start position:0%
house bill 1439
 
00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
relative to hospital visitation policies
 
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
and i note as a preliminary matter
 
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.510 align:start position:0%
and i note as a preliminary matter
that

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
there were
 
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
several sort of technical issues that i
 
00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
think we could address fairly simply and
 
00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.950 align:start position:0%
think we could address fairly simply and
then

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
simply start in on on the rest of it
 
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
and this
 
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
as far as i'm concerned this is a very
 
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
open discussion feel free to chime in
 
00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
when we get to things you need to chime
 
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
in on
 
00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
the the ones that i
 
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
noticed was
 
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
first of all on line 10
 
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
and line six
 
00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
the licensed person went to rsa 151
 
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
colon two
 
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
we were told that that was a really an
 
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
exact reference because
 
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
it includes things like renal dialysis
 
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
and adult day care centers and uh
 
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps doesn't include nursing homes
 
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
but this is intended to apply to nursing
 
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
homes so i think we might
 
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
so i had
 
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
i had a discussion with david ross and
 
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
right now they are required by by
 
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
federal law to allow
 
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.389 align:start position:0%
federal law to allow
visitors

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 align:start position:0%
visitors
 
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
i don't want to do anything to
 
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
jeopardize their funding should the
 
00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
federal government say you can't because
 
00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
then that leaves us in more precarious
 
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
situations so i'm okay with not
 
00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
including the nursing homes because like
 
00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
i said
 
00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
i spoke to him and right now
 
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
you know the federal government said you
 
00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
have to let someone in i think that's
 
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
something that should be addressed at
 
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
the federal level because we don't want
 
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
them to lose their funding
 
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
because if they do that we cause more
 
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
harm than good
 
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
okay in my humble opinion
 
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
okay so my my question also is
 
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
would that same provision cover the
 
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.710 align:start position:0%
would that same provision cover the
hospitals

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
that same issue
 
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
well no uh what i'm i'm referring to
 
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
what representative rice just said about
 
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
the concern for nursing homes is they
 
00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 align:start position:0%
are already required by the federal
 
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
government to allow
 
00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
what they did but i mean listen if it
 
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
comes down
 
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
if it comes down to it that you know
 
00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
this is going to affect hospitals too
 
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not bending on that
 
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
because and i'm sorry that i get angry
 
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
but nobody should be alone and facetime
 
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
that is not it you know what i mean i'm
 
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
not going to be i i get that i'm just
 
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:45.190 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
the state okay or
 
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
joint commission or dmv
 
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
then you need to follow
 
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.110 align:start position:0%
then you need to follow
what

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
because the cms is ever changing um cms
 
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
is reviewing those policies as well so
 
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:20.550 align:start position:0%
is reviewing those policies as well so
um

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
well we'll bear it in mind but there
 
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
isn't a similar requirement that people
 
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
have somebody with them at the end of
 
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
life that they do have in the nursing
 
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.070 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.990 align:start position:0%
right
right

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
right obviously then everybody has to
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
take that into account but i i just
 
00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to find out whether this might
 
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
all be moot not so we need to address
 
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
hospital issues
 
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.310 align:start position:0%
hospital issues
and

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
i i think that representative rice
 
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
brings up a really important point that
 
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
in the testimony that we heard
 
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
the issues that people were the most
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
were beginning of life issues and end of
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
life issues that's not to say that
 
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
somebody who is sick wouldn't benefit by
 
00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate contact with the people they
 
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
care about but
 
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
i think we want to be particularly
 
00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 align:start position:0%
careful with
 
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
beginning of life issues i mean
 
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
separating a a parent from a newborn and
 
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.270 align:start position:0%
separating a a parent from a newborn and
and

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 align:start position:0%
making sure that somebody who is dying
 
00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:44.629 align:start position:0%
making sure that somebody who is dying
has

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
somebody there with them
 
00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:48.710 align:start position:0%
somebody there with them
um

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
so um i'm just gonna make a note that i
 
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
will find a different way of saying this
 
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.350 align:start position:0%
will find a different way of saying this
so

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable as a committee
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
saying this applies to hospitals
 
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
and leaving out the nursing homes
 
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
just as an inch yeah go ahead
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
either one thanks um
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
i i would prefer
 
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
that it applies to nursing homes also
 
00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759 align:start position:0%
just because i've seen so much decline
 
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
mental well-being of the people in the
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
nursing homes since the pandemic started
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
that being said i think either way you
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
can you can phrase
 
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
the language so that if there is a
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
conflict with cms
 
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.469 align:start position:0%
conflict with cms
that

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
i think we could do something on the
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
order of to the extent permitted
 
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
by cms regulations
 
00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.390 align:start position:0%
by cms regulations
okay

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.189 align:start position:0%
okay
yep

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
just as a side note so um when my
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
grandma was dying um and and she died of
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
covid they had to once
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
they realized that she was at the end of
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
her life they had to transfer her
 
00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
actually out of the hospital into a
 
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation facility and at that
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
moment that was the only way we could
 
00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 align:start position:0%
see her
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
so and that was extremely hard on her
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
because she was within
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
i mean she was within 48 hours of death
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
at that time so i don't know if
 
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
if we
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
if we say that it doesn't apply to
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
hospitals and nursing homes does that
 
00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:26.790 align:start position:0%
hospitals and nursing homes does that
overburden

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
overburden
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
these rehabilitation places to then re
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
have to receive
 
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
the patients
 
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
well what the bill does if we pass the
 
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.029 align:start position:0%
well what the bill does if we pass the
bill

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
is require
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
all the facilities that the bill covers
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
to allow visitation subject
 
00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:47.189 align:start position:0%
to allow visitation subject
to

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
the provisions whatever the provisions
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
are that we finally put in the bill
 
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
there was one other thing that i noted
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
just from the beginning on page two
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
the department was concerned about
 
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
the language on line four about each
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
healthcare facility licensed person went
 
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.629 align:start position:0%
healthcare facility licensed person went
to

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
rsa 151.2 whatever language we use for
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
that she'll post on its website
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
informational materials
 
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
and they don't want to do the developing
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
of the materials they want to require
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
each facility to develop its own
 
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
materials and i'm assuming that the
 
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
facilities would prefer to develop their
 
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.830 align:start position:0%
facilities would prefer to develop their
own

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
so we could just line out developed by
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
services on line five
 
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
and the last sentence of that section so
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
it would read each healthcare facility
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
licensed pursuant whatever language we
 
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.190 align:start position:0%
licensed pursuant whatever language we
use

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
she'll post on its website informational
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
materials explaining the rights
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
specified in this section
 
00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:02.230 align:start position:0%
specified in this section
okay

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
and let me just have one more technical
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
correction here
 
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.750 align:start position:0%
correction here
on

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
section eight unless expressly required
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
by federal law or regulation which i
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
think probably takes care of the cms
 
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
stuff but i'll i would take that under
 
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.110 align:start position:0%
stuff but i'll i would take that under
advisement

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
advisement
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
the department or any state agency shall
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
not take action against any health care
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
facility and it was proposed to add in
 
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.990 align:start position:0%
facility and it was proposed to add in
their

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
action arising out of this statute
 
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
because if there was something
 
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.110 align:start position:0%
because if there was something
other

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.949 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
i have a question yep
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
so are you saying to um eliminate a b c
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
and d and just no no no no i i i'm just
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
they're all they all stay there
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh i just want to be sure that
 
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.590 align:start position:0%
uh i just want to be sure that
um

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
we don't want to limit liability unless
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's related
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
we want to limit liability related to
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
these this statute but if there was some
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
other situation
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
in which there was an issue we don't
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh the last issue that i note is a
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
technical issue
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
on lines 14 and 15
 
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.750 align:start position:0%
on lines 14 and 15
um

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
and i think it's actually a conflict
 
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.150 align:start position:0%
and i think it's actually a conflict
anyway

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh on lines 14 15.
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
what we're what line 8-9 says is
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
the state shall not take any action
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
but up above it says unless expressly
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
required by federal law
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
and then it says failing to follow the
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
guidelines of
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
centers for disease control and
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
prevention so
 
00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:11.670 align:start position:0%
prevention so
um

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.670 align:start position:0%
um
i

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.710 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
what we really want to do is
 
00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:21.670 align:start position:0%
what we really want to do is
to

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
ha to take that out because
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
they should be following those
 
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.110 align:start position:0%
they should be following those
guidelines

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
is the sense that we had
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
my question there is that
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between federal
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
laws and federal regulations and
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
guidelines from federal agencies
 
00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:38.870 align:start position:0%
guidelines from federal agencies
and

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
that that has a distinguishing factor
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
between when it's law or regulations and
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
when it's guidelines because there's a
 
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:45.990 align:start position:0%
when it's guidelines because there's a
different

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
there's there's a different process that
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
goes into developing guidelines we've
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
heard that they change
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
and i was curious if we'd be able to get
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
a copy of them or find out because if
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
all of this is subject to the cms
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines that should be available not
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
just to our committee but to anybody who
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
anybody know how we can find that easily
 
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.710 align:start position:0%
anybody know how we can find that easily
or

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.509 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
so that's all the notes that i have so
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
jump in yeah okay so um one other thing
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
that i i want to make sure that this
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
covers and and you know keep in mind hhs
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
is not my area of expertise
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
but i did receive calls from people who
 
00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:42.949 align:start position:0%
but i did receive calls from people who
have

00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
loved ones in rehabilitation facilities
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
who are unable to visit them as of right
 
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.350 align:start position:0%
who are unable to visit them as of right
now

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.790 align:start position:0%
now
and

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
she she was like one of the women was
 
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.790 align:start position:0%
she she was like one of the women was
like

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
i know his baseline they don't know
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
him why am i not there
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
to you know make them aware of changes
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
they don't know what changed to him they
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
don't know him right so she had asked
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
that we include rehabilitation centers
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
and as you can imagine
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
so i had no idea kevin langdon was going
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
to do a story on this but can i just
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
tell you the amount of emails and people
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
calling me and the support this has had
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
has been overwhelming well
 
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.670 align:start position:0%
has been overwhelming well
i

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think any of us sitting here
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
need to be convinced of that i mean i am
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
i am well aware of the concerns that i
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
heard when our county nursing home shut
 
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.629 align:start position:0%
heard when our county nursing home shut
down

00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
and there were concerns on both sides of
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
how do we keep people safe and how do we
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
keep them in touch with their loved ones
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
and all of the issues of facetime is not
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
adequate for somebody who has dementia
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
they you know they may not know who they
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
are but
 
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
you can hold their hand but people
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
couldn't and even
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
when visitation started it was six feet
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
apart in in the parking lot so
 
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.829 align:start position:0%
apart in in the parking lot so
um

00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
i think i think the thing is how do we
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
balance out
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
making sure that people have the contact
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
that they need and that you know that's
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
across all kinds of facilities so we
 
00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
need to figure out
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're going to aim at
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
because one of my things is
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
all the kids we have in in
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
residential group homes didn't see
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
anybody for months and
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
they too are people who
 
00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
are particularly vulnerable and
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
particularly needing of reintegration
 
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.430 align:start position:0%
particularly needing of reintegration
into

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
the broader society so
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
uh we've got
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
the the there's a lot to do but we need
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
to figure out what we're going to do in
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and what is the subject of
 
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.030 align:start position:0%
this bill and what is the subject of
other

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
other bills
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
so i will look up 151
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
colon 2 and figure out about
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
the regulations and what might be a
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
better way of phrasing what we're
 
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.310 align:start position:0%
better way of phrasing what we're
covering

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.750 align:start position:0%
 
other

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts concerns and i'm i am going to
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
give anybody in the audience if you want
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
to jump in with things that you're
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned about that are
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
still in there
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
now's the time to leap up and say so
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
so uh a lot of the feedback that i
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
received in emails were that we should
 
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
amend out um
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
the exceptions to this
 
00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:39.350 align:start position:0%
the exceptions to this
where

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
you know a healthcare provider could
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
just say oh
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
basically could just nullify this whole
 
00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
the exceptions are in page 1 14 through
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
18. there they are yes
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
so i think it was just a um
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
that the presence of visitors would
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
medically or therapeutically be
 
00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:13.350 align:start position:0%
medically or therapeutically be
contraindicated

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
contraindicated
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
in the clinical judgment of healthcare
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
professionals i think that's very
 
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.829 align:start position:0%
professionals i think that's very
broad

00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
broad
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
and open-ended and
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
just leaves a lot of room for
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:13.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
parents and
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
so we might try amending
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
that first thing to
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
incorporate the provisions of the
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights so it would be
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to
 
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:53.270 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to
legislate

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.789 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
i i understand that it's relative to the
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
pandemic but i think what we're trying
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
to do here is balance out the
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
flexibility that you need with
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
some other changing condition that we
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
the care that each of us would want to
 
00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:32.230 align:start position:0%
the care that each of us would want to
see

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
if it were our loved one
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know i think i think there are
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
things here i mean it it is
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
relatively clear to me and i assume it's
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
clear to everybody else unless we
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
somebody thinks we need to make it more
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
specific we're talking about one person
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
for each person we're not talking about
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
the entire extended family or
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
having your entire office come and see
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
you in the recovery room which happened
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
to me once and they were closer to me as
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
my family but i was still a little
 
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.590 align:start position:0%
my family but i was still a little
startled

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
startled
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
you know you don't really actually want
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
people to see you when you're drooling
 
00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.470 align:start position:0%
people to see you when you're drooling
but

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.070 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
so if
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
let's look at incorporating the
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights in that first
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
one and so that it's more patient
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
centered rather than yeah go ahead
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
there already is a patient bill of
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
rights that has been violated through
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.549 align:start position:0%
the whole
pandemic

00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:39.830 align:start position:0%
pandemic
correct

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
so on that note
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
um should we look at bringing a penalty
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
for violating that patient bill of
 
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:45.990 align:start position:0%
for violating that patient bill of
rights

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
because if they're not
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know if if we've had this in place
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
and people have been dying alone in
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals without being able to have
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
loved ones even though it's guaranteed
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
in that bill of rights then maybe we
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
need some kind of
 
00:20:58.159 --> 00:20:59.830 align:start position:0%
need some kind of
um

00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
you know it needs teeth i i'm guessing
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
that a penalty is a matter for another
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
day because that would make it a second
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
committee bill and it would
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
and we've already passed the point of
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
that but that also is
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
that was very very different than normal
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
operating procedures there's no
 
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.430 align:start position:0%
operating procedures there's no
questions

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.630 align:start position:0%
questions
absolutely

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals want to ensure that patients
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
have the ability to see their family and
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
their loved ones during those times
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's no question
 
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
we've learned a lot over this period
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
shortly after the pandemic began we
 
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
actually worked with the department on
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
creating some guidance around visitation
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
having that caregiver being able to come
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
in and be a part of that and that's what
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
our hospitals are trying to do
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
we want it to be but we have to have the
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility to be able to respond in a
 
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.990 align:start position:0%
flexibility to be able to respond in a
way

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we're trying to do
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to prevent family
 
00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:54.789 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to prevent family
members

00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
so if i may yeah madam chair are are you
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
yeah you're the chair right i am now um
 
00:23:01.679 --> 00:23:03.510 align:start position:0%
yeah you're the chair right i am now um
so

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
again i say
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
that i don't understand how a nurse can
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
go in there
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
dressed in ppe with the mask
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
full blown but a family member can't
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
because that nurse can very easily
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
spread it just as much as a family
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
member when they go home
 
00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.350 align:start position:0%
member when they go home
i

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
and therein lies my frustration
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
right because
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
if i have to do everything the nurse
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
does why am i going to be the one that's
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
going to spread it and not the nurse
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
that leaves that hospital and goes home
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
to their family
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
and i agree with you on that except for
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
one exception and that is
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
people in my town
 
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.110 align:start position:0%
people in my town
were

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
turning men's shirts
 
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.630 align:start position:0%
turning men's shirts
into

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
coverings for
 
00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.310 align:start position:0%
coverings for
the

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
folks who worked in our nursing homes
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
because there was no ppe and
 
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
i think that that's really
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
the point of a
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
and i understand the concerns about a
 
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.669 align:start position:0%
and i understand the concerns about a
because

00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
it it
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
but there was a time when we didn't have
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
any ppe we didn't have enough for the
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
providers let alone
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
other people going in
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
that would to me
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
be a situation if we left a in
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
that that might be an issue uh just just
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
because of the unavailability
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
but i would hope that now that we've
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
been through this
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
that we don't run into this problem
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
again right we
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
we learned with this second round that
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
you know we knew was coming
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
was everyone prepared
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
that that is you know my question we
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
know now in the future
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
we need more we i think this has been a
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
lesson learned and i i would hope that
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know everyone is better prepared god
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
forbid there should be another nightmare
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
coming our way
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
well i think we've all learned a lot
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead
 
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.110 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead
certainly

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
so on on a if if the concern is ppe
 
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.310 align:start position:0%
so on on a if if the concern is ppe
could

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
could we tighten the language to make
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
that clear and and perhaps
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
um visitors could provide their own ppe
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
even if the hospital does doesn't have
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
it you know just make it clear
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
um you know change a to the uh ppe for
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
visitors is unavailable
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh to be provided by the hospital
 
00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.510 align:start position:0%
uh to be provided by the hospital
however

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
they may provide their own
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
and i think it would have to be sealed
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
right right nothing open like if if
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
people are going to bring their own
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
here's here's here's the issue with that
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
first of all on line 21
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
we have required
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
as it stands that the hospital provide
 
00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:08.870 align:start position:0%
as it stands that the hospital provide
equipment

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
and in a time of
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
no shortages that
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate we're also talking about
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
equipment that's expensive
 
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.549 align:start position:0%
equipment that's expensive
so

00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:28.870 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.870 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:42.390 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.740 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:45.750 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:58.149 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:58.159 --> 00:26:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
well i was wondering if it might be
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
again it leaves things wobbly
 
00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.510 align:start position:0%
again it leaves things wobbly
but

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
if we simply eliminate the fact that
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
provided that any such required
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
equipment shall be provided by the
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.919 --> 00:27:40.870 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
if if it's may we don't need to put it
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
in there because they they can always do
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
it if they want to do it it's
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:49.909 align:start position:0%
uh but
uh

00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
you know the sentence would then read a
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
healthcare facility may require visitors
 
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
to wear personal protective equipment
 
00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.710 align:start position:0%
to wear personal protective equipment
period

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.990 align:start position:0%
period
right

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
i i actually have a suggestion there the
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
words probably aren't perfect but um
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
shall be provided by the healthcare
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
facility unless there is a shortage of
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
ppe for staff in a shortage a visitor
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
can request approval of self-provided
 
00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.789 align:start position:0%
can request approval of self-provided
ppe

00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
ppe
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
in this is in for line 21 before the
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
period at the end of this
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
facility it would add unless there is a
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
shortage of ppe for staff in a shortage
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
a visitor can request approval of
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
self-provided ppe and obviously turned
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
into bill language as opposed to common
 
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.630 align:start position:0%
into bill language as opposed to common
language

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
the language is very good actually i
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
mean it's quite clear as to what you're
 
00:28:42.159 --> 00:28:47.990 align:start position:0%
mean it's quite clear as to what you're
intending

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
it said a visitor can request approval
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
if it's not approved it's not approved
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
if you're required to wear if the
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
healthcare facility may require a
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
visitor to wear ppe and if what they
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
provide isn't approved then it's not
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
approved if you can't comply with that
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
regulation you can be denied
 
00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully hopefully somebody bringing a
 
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
sealed package and something that is up
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
to the standards that are used in the
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
hospital would be accepted
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
if not i think that would be a different
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
problem and i have a lot of faith in our
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals and i don't think that they
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
would play any games like that so i
 
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
think that that would allow a respectful
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
dialogue where if somebody already has
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
ppe and they have it so they can go
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
visit their mom
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
if this happens in the next one
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
and one of if if i can there's
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
one other
 
00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
concern that i had here
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
last year we had the change in the
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
durable power of attorney
 
00:29:47.039 --> 00:29:47.909 align:start position:0%
durable power of attorney
and

00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
that also allowed for the physician
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
aprn or a physician's assistant to serve
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
as that durable power of attorney if the
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
self-identified one isn't available i'm
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
curious if those the actual patients
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
durable power of attorneys are able to
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
visit them in the healthcare facilities
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
or if the medical staff is serving in
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
that role because visitation isn't being
 
00:30:09.679 --> 00:30:15.269 align:start position:0%
that role because visitation isn't being
allowed

00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
so the the the people who have the
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
durable power of attorney are able to
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.679 --> 00:30:36.789 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:36.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
each hospital has developed their own
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
policies so they have consistency when
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
it comes to certain things again parents
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
they have restrictions primarily when
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
they're trying to do that they hope when
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
someone wants a covetation that is when
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
end of life at this point in time that
 
00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:05.509 align:start position:0%
end of life at this point in time that
is

00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
the other challenge has been our
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise um be here
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
in the future trying to fix this the
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
other problem i have heard from other
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
is unfortunately
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
folks are showing up at the hospital
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
thinking that they can come visit saying
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's a law that says i can come and
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
visit my loved one and unfortunately um
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
due to circumstances at that hospital
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
they have put in restrictions that are
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
not allowed for necessarily a visitor
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
and it has caused a lot of problems for
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
a front level staff and we really
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
well i'd i'd like to know a little more
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
about that because i mean hospitals
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
already have the right to do things like
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
establish visiting hours and and stuff
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
like that and then
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know there
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
there should be and
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
people have exceptions for end of life
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
ob gyn things like that
 
00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:37.830 align:start position:0%
ob gyn things like that
um

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is are people just
 
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
coming and saying oh i get to visit any
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
or what kind of restrictions are the
 
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
hospitals putting on that have become a
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
problem because
 
00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.230 align:start position:0%
problem because
the

00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
the whole point of this seems to me to
 
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
the problem is the restrictions and
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
i certainly get
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
that if you have an emergency room
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
that's so packed that you've got
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
people out in the hallways and and
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
b the presence of visitors would
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
interfere with the care rights of any
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
patient because you're balancing the
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
rights of patient a
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
with the privacy and the rights of
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
patient b
 
00:33:36.559 --> 00:33:37.750 align:start position:0%
patient b
so

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
you need to make a determination there
 
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.509 align:start position:0%
you need to make a determination there
um

00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
because both of those people have rights
 
00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.830 align:start position:0%
because both of those people have rights
and

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
you the hospital are stuck between a
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
rock and a hard place because you do
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
have the rights of patient a and you
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.389 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
that would be how i would interpret the
 
00:34:03.039 --> 00:34:04.149 align:start position:0%
that would be how i would interpret the
point

00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
of of b
 
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
and that's how you get to the
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility of dealing with
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
you know what happens when you're in a
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
complete crisis situation and you know
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
we hope that you're still working at
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
right at this minute
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
i guess you made described what i think
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
could actually happen because you that's
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
your interpretation the next person
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
interprets it very differently
 
00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:43.669 align:start position:0%
interprets it very differently
and

00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
that's where the i think the tension
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.599 --> 00:35:08.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
but isn't that why the hospital is
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
supposed to develop a policy and post it
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
on their website
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
which they do and which they
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
certainly nothing in this
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
prohibits them from changing what they
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
have as a policy posted on their website
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
as circumstances change so you i mean
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
am i not right in thinking that
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
if there was a particular issue that you
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
you could
 
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
revise your policy
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
still have your policy
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
explain how you're going to deal with
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
the issues
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
but it wouldn't be under the same
 
00:35:48.400 --> 00:36:02.390 align:start position:0%
but it wouldn't be under the same
conditions

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
well i think we probably have uh i will
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
just say that i know out there in the
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
real world we have a spectrum of people
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
who range from
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll will figure out about
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable policies too it is my right
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
to see my loved one any minute of the
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
by all means chime in but i you know
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
that is out there and that's not
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
something i'm going to advocate for
 
00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.990 align:start position:0%
something i'm going to advocate for
but

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh i do think that
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know i'm thinking about
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
similar bills that we've had where one
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
of the things we have
 
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
sought as a solution
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
is to make sure
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm thinking arts venues which is
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
very different but
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
they have to post their policy up front
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
and then people get to decide whether to
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
buy a ticket or not and
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
that makes sense to me and i know that
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
the two situations are not at all
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
equivalent but
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to drive at is
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
what all what's required here is a
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
policy by the hospital and the hospital
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
has the flexibility to change the policy
 
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.790 align:start position:0%
has the flexibility to change the policy
um

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.950 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
they need to be stating the policy and
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
that gives the hospital some flexibility
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
the poor candy striper or whatever they
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
have nowadays who's sitting at the front
 
00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.069 align:start position:0%
have nowadays who's sitting at the front
desk

00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
desk
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
gets to say
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
here's our policy
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
it says you can't come at three o'clock
 
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
in the morning
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
and and and
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
they can point to that and and they're
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
not having to sit there
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
interpreting something in the front
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
hallway and that's not going to stop
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
people to come from coming and
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
demanding to see people and being angry
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
but i have to assume that you had plenty
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
of people who were angry in your front
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
hallway or outside your front hallway
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
because you couldn't get into the front
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
a state law
 
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
i guess that's
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
what i'm still struggling with if they
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
allow the flexibility
 
00:38:53.839 --> 00:38:55.750 align:start position:0%
allow the flexibility
they

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
do post it on their website
 
00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:11.430 align:start position:0%
do post it on their website
they

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:18.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
well the counter argument to that is if
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
you're doing it already why doesn't it
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
why do you mind if it's a state law as
 
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.310 align:start position:0%
why do you mind if it's a state law as
well

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.430 align:start position:0%
well
but

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead and i'm just gonna just excuse
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
me one minute um
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
because we have people coming in for the
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
next hearing i'm gonna end it at uh
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
quarter past and i think i'll schedule
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
another meeting for next tuesday morning
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
if that's okay with people and and we'll
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
bring some drafting so that people can
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
look at it and will you send me your
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
language on that one piece so i have it
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
and i'll put it in but if anybody else
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
wants to bring other drafting by all
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
means bring it along and we'll pass it
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
all out and see what we can do with the
 
00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.510 align:start position:0%
all out and see what we can do with the
words

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
words
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead thank you madam chair just
 
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
on the the question of
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
why why we need a state law it seems
 
00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire hospital
 
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
association respectfully i understand
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
that they really need flexibility and
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
they want it but
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
we also
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
our patients really need their rights
 
00:40:15.599 --> 00:40:16.710 align:start position:0%
our patients really need their rights
respected

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
respected
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
and that's why we need this law and
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
that's why there can't be wiggle room
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
for them to just put in restrictions
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
whenever there's an outbreak of of a
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know a communicable disease
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
the whole point is we were in an
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
outbreak of a communicable disease and
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
people were being harmed greatly by
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
these policies and and the flexibility
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
to restrict visitors
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
um during that time so
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
my concern for for a is section three
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
part a it still remains and i i think it
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
curtailed so that they can't use it as a
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
means to wiggle out of this
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm quite sure that
 
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
that section is the one we're going to
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
be fighting it out over in the in the
 
00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.109 align:start position:0%
be fighting it out over in the in the
end

00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
end
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
so yeah go ahead
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair one of the other
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
points we might want to address in here
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
is looking at more access even in a
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
pandemic for an activated durable power
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
of attorney or surrogate because even in
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
a pandemic
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
if the patient can't make their own
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
medical decisions having somebody who
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
knows them and knows their wishes helped
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
to make that decision regardless of what
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
kind of spacesuit they need to put on
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
is very important to protecting these
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
patients rights especially if we end up
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
with another novel
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
novel outbreak like this where people
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
are just trying to find a solution
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
so that we can establish we can restore
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
some of the trust that's been lost
 
00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
because i'm really worried about what
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
this is going to do to the health care
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
system over over time because a lot of
 
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.589 align:start position:0%
system over over time because a lot of
people

00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of people feel like it's one side
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
versus another and we need to figure out
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
how to bring that back together because
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
people go into this profession to cure
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
people and help people
 
00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.030 align:start position:0%
people and help people
and

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
and right now there's a lot of trust
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
loss so if we can get those people who
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
are the activated durable power of
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
attorney or surrogates and have
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps more restrictive and more
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
specific language but allow them access
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
in greater
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
allow them more access i think would be
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
very important okay duly noted
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh with that i think i'm going to just
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
suspend at this point recess the
 
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and i will re-notice it for
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
8 30 next tuesday that's okay yep
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
and i thank you all there's lots
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
lots more to think about and
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
if anybody who is in attendance has
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
language they would like to propose on
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
anything we would also love to take that
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
into account
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
and on we go thank you all very much
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
okay i hate to break up all the fun
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
dog mom you're sitting in a very good
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
spot because we've had as many as four
 
01:02:21.359 --> 01:02:22.630 align:start position:0%
spot because we've had as many as four
dogs

01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
dogs
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
right at that table this year
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
for reasons good reasons really
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely not that there needs to be
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
but i would take off my hat and respect
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
to the committee as i said to
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
representative weber earlier i'm very
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
proud to be a dog mom but
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
my parents taught me to take my hat off
 
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
to show respect so well we feel your
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
respect both before and after you're
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on house bill 1290 fn

01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm here today to introduce house
 
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
bill 1290 which would convene a task
 
01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
force to study precision medicine and
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
biomarker testing
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
the task force would be charged
 
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
with making recommendations to the
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
legislature to foster greater awareness
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
understanding and access to precision
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
medicine and biomarker testing among
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
patients health care providers employers
 
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
and the public and private payers
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
you might be asking yourself what
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
qualifies and motivates me to speak to
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
the subject a poor attorney
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
no medical background and a year ago i
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
would have asked myself the same
 
01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.309 align:start position:0%
would have asked myself the same
question

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
but in january of 21 my life changed
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
when i was diagnosed with stage four
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
endometrial uterine cancer
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
ah sorry about that
 
01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.470 align:start position:0%
ah sorry about that
i

01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
i'm undergoing intensive chemotherapy
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
and suffering from the side effects
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
the treatment has not gone well and
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
we've begun exploring alternative
 
01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.910 align:start position:0%
we've begun exploring alternative
therapies

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
therapies
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
and treatments some of those
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
alternatives involve biomarkers and many
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
of them are promising however these
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
treatments are expensive
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
costing between thirty five thousand and
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
sixty five thousand dollars a dose
 
01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:46.870 align:start position:0%
sixty five thousand dollars a dose
um

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
and hopefully more and more providers
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
are covering that but many don't
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
i wish i'd been aware of biomarker
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
dating data years ago perhaps i could
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
have taken steps that would have stopped
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
or slowed the growth of the cancer i'm
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
now suffering from
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
nearly two-thirds of all medical
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
treatments in pre-clinical development
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
rely on macro data
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
in fact biomarker testing is available
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
for an ever increasing range of
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
conditions and diseases
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
however patient access to this testing
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
has not kept pace with the growth of the
 
01:05:18.799 --> 01:05:20.230 align:start position:0%
has not kept pace with the growth of the
science

01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
science
 
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
more widespread knowledge among health
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
care providers and more efficient
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
coverage policies among insurance
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
carriers both public and private is
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
required to integrate biomarker testing
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
into the practice of medicine
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
an initiative and commitment by this
 
01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.470 align:start position:0%
an initiative and commitment by this
legislature

01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
to promote biomarker testing
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
would contribute significantly to the
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
prevention and early detection of cancer
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
as i said i'm an attorney by trade not a
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
medical practitioner but others will be
 
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
testifying today who provide you with a
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
wealth of information about the benefits
 
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
of this legislation
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
i simply ask that you move forward in
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
some manner so that we can spare people
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
facing the future that i may face from
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
appearing before you in the years ahead
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
for those reasons i ask that you please
 
01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.710 align:start position:0%
for those reasons i ask that you please
support

01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
and vote ought to pass on 1290
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
if not in this exact form
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
in some form it will accomplish the
 
01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
goals that we've set forward and with
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
that i thank you very much for your time
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
i do have written testimony that i can
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
provide for the committee and i'll be
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
glad to try to answer questions but as i
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
said i think the technical questions
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
would be better answered by people that
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
are following me
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
you won't be surprised to know that i
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
as i read the bill you have taken what's
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
a pretty novel approach in that
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh you have this task force as a
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of
 
01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.309 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of
uh

01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:06:57.599 --> 01:06:58.870 align:start position:0%
uh the
uh

01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
shall convene yeah the task force is as
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
a subset of the health and human
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
services oversight committee and you
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
have also tasked the oversight committee
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
with appointing certain of the people on
 
01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:12.069 align:start position:0%
with appointing certain of the people on
it

01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:07:12.079 --> 01:07:13.109 align:start position:0%
it
uh

01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
i realize that it requires buy-in from
 
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
the committee and i can't
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not on it so i can't say anything
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
about that but is there anything that
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
would prevent the committee from
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
establishing this immediately as they
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
already have a mechanism for
 
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.270 align:start position:0%
already have a mechanism for
establishing

01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
establishing
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittees on various subjects and
 
01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
my recollection is that as long as
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
there is one member of the oversight
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
committee on the subcommittee
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
is there any reason why they could could
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
not should they choose to do so
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
appoint this task force at their next
 
01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.549 align:start position:0%
appoint this task force at their next
meeting

01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
i see no reason they couldn't um as i
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
said the goals are to make sure that
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
there's more awareness that there's a um
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
imperture of official them that the
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
legislature is in fact um
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
making this a priority and something
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
that we want to look into in years ahead
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
i know that there's people
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
on the committee that have done research
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
in this field since the 1950s and know a
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
great deal about the field but i think
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
as i said the public and the providers
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
and then that group of people need to
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
know more about it need to be aware of
 
01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
it we'd like to have an annual report
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
that can be there that's this official
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
stamp of the legislature that
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
this legislature sees it as an important
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
area to to keep abreast of so if there's
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
another mechanism of doing it
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
that will be quicker or we get to the
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
point i don't seem to have a problem at
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you for
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
coming to join us representative rogers
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
um you have specified in the draft
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
legislation a rather lengthy list of
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
commissioned members
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
with highly specific credentials
 
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
would it be easier more effective to
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
create a
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
a more agile commission of smaller
 
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.229 align:start position:0%
a more agile commission of smaller
numbers

01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
selected at the behest of the oversight
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
committee um i would leave that to the
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
judgment of this committee i serve on
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
finance and i'm an attorney so i can do
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
numbers and um and legal things i'm not
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
a medical person i don't know the best
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
way necessarily to pull this group
 
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
together this was as comprehensive as as
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
we could think of but if there's ways
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
that can accomplish the goals as i said
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
um that will be done in a more agile way
 
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
as you say um you this committee would
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
know better so i would leave it to the
 
01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.189 align:start position:0%
know better so i would leave it to the
judgment

01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
judgment
 
01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up
 
01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:02.950 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up
and

01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
given representative weber's comment
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
that we might
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
simply put this in the lap of the
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
acceptable to you to simply
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
let the build eye and let that happen
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
and get this moving expeditiously um i
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
would rather you not let the bill die
 
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
simply because the message that that
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
would send um isn't as positive as a
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
message it's saying we feel this is
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
important i would rather if if there's
 
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
another way to move forward to adapt the
 
01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:38.630 align:start position:0%
another way to move forward to adapt the
bill

01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
or to simply put it to
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
a study or or something at this point my
 
01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
fear is if you you kill the bill the
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
message it sends
 
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
not that it's an intended message but
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
the message that it could possibly send
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
is this is an area that's either too
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
complicated we don't want to get into it
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
or it's too much or we're not we don't
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
think it's important and i think
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
i spend a lot of time with other cancer
 
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
patients and i think it's important to
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
to us to our families
 
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
to know that this is important
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
um and that's why an official stamp by
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's positive
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
will go a long way towards people that
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
are are suffering now or are going to be
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
in the position that they're going to be
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
using some of this biomarker testing
 
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
possibly so i think that a positive
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
message is very important so if in some
 
01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:34.709 align:start position:0%
message is very important so if in some
form

01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
form
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
it could be passed with a stamp that
 
01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.070 align:start position:0%
it could be passed with a stamp that
says

01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:11:41.189 --> 01:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
this legislature believes that this is
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
something important for the future and
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
we want to see it keep going we want to
 
01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.070 align:start position:0%
we want to see it keep going we want to
see

01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
um yearly progress reports and so forth
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
so that's why i ask you very
 
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.070 align:start position:0%
so that's why i ask you very
aggressively

01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
aggressively
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
not to kill the bill but to find another
 
01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
way to do it so you can send forth a
 
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
positive message because keep in mind
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of cancer patients
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of family members um and i
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
think probably almost everybody can say
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
they either know someone that they're
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
close to or have lost someone from
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
various forms of cancer so a positive
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
message isn't something they get a lot
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
and i think it would be very powerful if
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
this legislature could send a positive
 
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
message to that community
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
just a request of those who are in the
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
audience if you wish to testify please
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
fill out the pink card and send it up
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
now thank you representative folsom
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you
 
01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:41.500 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.430 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
[Laughter]

01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
i think i'm
 
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
thinking in the same vein as the
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
previous two uh
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
legislators that have had qui asked
 
01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:55.430 align:start position:0%
legislators that have had qui asked
questions

01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
i am wondering if you would be open to
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
an amendment where
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
task force was
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
put forward in a bill but without all
 
01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:08.470 align:start position:0%
put forward in a bill but without all
the

01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
the details lined up of who's going to
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
be on it but leave that to the
 
01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.030 align:start position:0%
be on it but leave that to the
discretion

01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.390 align:start position:0%
discretion
of

01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
01:13:20.719 --> 01:13:21.669 align:start position:0%
um and then
uh

01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know so it just becomes a little bit
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
more simpler so we can pass it and hand
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
it off quicker i understand and as i
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
said in my testimony i'm i'm open to any
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
suggestions i would suggest that that
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
maybe the committee work with um
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
mike rolo who's here from the american
 
01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:40.310 align:start position:0%
mike rolo who's here from the american
cancers

01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
cancers
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
probably not getting it right but
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
american cancer society anyway
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
because i know this is something that
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
they're very
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
excited about and so i would just ask
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
that you work with him
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
to move in one direction but i think
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
that all of us that want this to go
 
01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
forward are willing and more than happy
 
01:13:59.669 --> 01:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
iterations that are different than the
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
exact bill
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
representative catherine
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
i'm going to just say in the same
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
similar words
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
as long as we can get this through with
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
the respect that a bill gets
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we can amend it so that
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
it would acknowledge a
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
committee starting immediately
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
so we get both things we get speediness
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
and we would make it simple enough that
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
they could initiate it now
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
and we'll give the blessing of this is
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
important so that's why we're going to
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
make it into uh into an rsa i think i
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
think that would be wonderful and as i
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
said i would just ask that you work with
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
mr rolo from this cancer because they've
 
01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
been working on this
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
all around the world and the country and
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
so forth and that they might have some
 
01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.390 align:start position:0%
so forth and that they might have some
suggestions

01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
does medicare cover this
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
um you may not be old enough i do i
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
don't i i don't know the answer to that
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
at this point i know that in my
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
particular case
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
that it covers it once you've exhausted
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
all the possibilities with chemo once
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
once chemotherapy is not working
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
um in my particular case then it would
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
cover some alternatives but i'm not sure
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
to what extent
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the the things that um
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully people can look into but i'm
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
not exactly sure at this point so
 
01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:36.709 align:start position:0%
not exactly sure at this point so
sorry

01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative rogers for being here
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
today and i'm so happy to see you
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
the beginning of your bill says that
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
sixty percent of medical treatments and
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
pre-clinical development rely on
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
biomarker data i know that we have less
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
access to clinical research here in new
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire than we do down in
 
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and i was wondering if it
 
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
would actually make your goal more to
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
encourage well remove any barriers to
 
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
clinical research here in new hampshire
 
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
so that people can access innovative
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
care closer to home
 
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
um yes i think you're perfectly on board
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
with that in this
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
same line of thinking
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative as the chairman
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
of oversight who will get to do all this
 
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
fun stuff with help
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of it i'm going to give to
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
i see nothing in here that says any of
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
these people
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
a representative a technologist so and
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
so on have to be members of the state of
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire or residents we could go a
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
little wider on this task force
 
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
could we that was the intent is to to
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
make it broad as possible so that we
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
could get the best people to work with
 
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.110 align:start position:0%
could get the best people to work with
us

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
we are fortunate in new hampshire
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
that we do have dartmouth hitchcock
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
which is one of the leaders in doing a
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
lot of work
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
in all the areas of cancer but i fully
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that there are experts
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
outside of the state thank you
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and also thank you
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
rod just for being here it's good to see
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
you as well
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
i look at this as kind of a
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
three-pronged approach one is building
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
awareness which definitely we need to do
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
and i fully support that actually
 
01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
support the bill
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
second after we build awareness is
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
building utilization of it because
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
that's going to be critical to
 
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
help it's going to help patients help
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
people like yourself and others to
 
01:17:38.159 --> 01:17:39.350 align:start position:0%
people like yourself and others to
follow

01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
the third one is not really addressed
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
here much and that's the payment source
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
is the economics to it and i would
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
encourage us to think about
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
once we get to the point where someone's
 
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
aware of it the providers utilizes it
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
but then the patient runs into the
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
barrier because no one's paying for it
 
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
and it's coming out of the pocket so is
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
there anything in here as far as
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
the bill or the amendment to try to
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
tackle that either
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee of new hampshire house
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
people from the insurance i see one reps
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
here from the insurance
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
industry but what about other people
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
coming from other areas that could help
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
on the economics of it i think that
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
there's probably other areas it was
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
that was something that was maybe down
 
01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
the line a little bit after the other
 
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
two were established so i think that
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
that's why there's not as much in here
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
at this point but i think you're
 
01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
thinking along the right line of how i
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
would think that
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
obviously if people are aware of it and
 
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
we've developed it it would be
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
cruel i guess to say oh here is this
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
thing out here that can save your life
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
but we're not going to help you so um
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that that's a great way of
 
01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.550 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that that's a great way of
thinking

01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and
 
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming and
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
as we've had discussions this is a
 
01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
favorite topic of mine for some number
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
of years
 
01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:00.870 align:start position:0%
of years
um

01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
it is a huge
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
undertaking to say the least and
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes if we bite off too much we
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
some of the areas we are talking about
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
here are biomarker testing precision
 
01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
medicine and molecular testing and they
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
would there be any wiggle room to sort
 
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
of as a start focus on one of those
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
like you you're focusing on the
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
biomarkers in your comments
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
with precision medicine that's genetics
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
and that opens up another huge
 
01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.510 align:start position:0%
and that opens up another huge
area

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
would that be something that would be of
 
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
or do you feel like all three areas
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
should be included
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
i guess i
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
i always want everything
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
to start with but as i said i serve on
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
the finance committee so i'm used to
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
not getting everything
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
but you ask to begin with anyway so i
 
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.470 align:start position:0%
but you ask to begin with anyway so i
think

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.430 align:start position:0%
think
that

01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
obviously it would be nice and it would
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
be helpful to be able to include
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
everything but if this committee in its
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
wisdom thinks that it's better
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
to start
 
01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:21.030 align:start position:0%
to start
small

01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
small
 
01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
or start not small but start in one area
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
and then move to the other
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
as i said i would defer to the expertise
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
of this committee and especially
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
dr woods representative doctor i know
 
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
that your background um as i say
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
ascertained goes back to the 50s on this
 
01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
topic and you know more about this than
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
probably almost anybody in the building
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
so um i think your judgment is is
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
crucial on this and if you think that
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's better to target one area first um
 
01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
instead of doing them at the same time
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
or doing the same time
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
i guess i would say i would defer to
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
your knowledge as i said i'm an attorney
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:08.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
also

01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
there are several dimensions of getting
 
01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
to where we want to go as representative
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
merchant mentioned
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
the end point is that it's common
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
knowledge everybody uses it and it's all
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
paid for
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
but you also outline in
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
studying the role of clinical practice
 
01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.910 align:start position:0%
studying the role of clinical practice
guidelines

01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.030 align:start position:0%
guidelines
that

01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
that gets into the clinical one's basic
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
science this is clinical practice
 
01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:32.790 align:start position:0%
science this is clinical practice
uh

01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
would sort of leaving that part out
 
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
because developing that is another huge
 
01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
huge huge ask
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
i i guess i would say i don't want the
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
perfect to be the enemy of the good here
 
01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.310 align:start position:0%
perfect to be the enemy of the good here
um

01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:47.350 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
however we need to wiggle or squirm or
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
whatever um i as i said i would ask the
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
committee work with mr rolo because
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
they've got some ideas and thoughts but
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
i think if you all work together that
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
you can come out with something that
 
01:22:02.159 --> 01:22:03.510 align:start position:0%
you can come out with something that
establishes

01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
establishes
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
or meets the goals that i've talked
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
about thank you but thank you very much
 
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
before i call on someone else i thank
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
you representative for letting us use
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
your room
 
01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.950 align:start position:0%
your room
[Laughter]

01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
i've just spoken to the chair and i've
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
spoken to the vice chair and i've asked
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
what can we do to keep this room
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
um they said they'd get back to me i
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to go back to two i will warn
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
you it is very cold on certain days
 
01:22:27.199 --> 01:22:28.310 align:start position:0%
you it is very cold on certain days
however

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
um especially the folks that sit on that
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
side so
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
for the rest of you you're lucky but if
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
you sit over there it can get a little
 
01:22:36.159 --> 01:22:39.430 align:start position:0%
you sit over there it can get a little
chilly

01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
they graciously have said nothing about
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
that but just soldiered on
 
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
 
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you for
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
being here
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
my concerns do echo a great deal what
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
representative woods pointed out
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm concerned as well with this fact
 
01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
that it gets into the science piece and
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
it is still some evolving science and we
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
have good people in industry and in
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
academic institutions working on it
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
and that's something that this task
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
force wouldn't seem like it could really
 
01:23:08.239 --> 01:23:09.350 align:start position:0%
force wouldn't seem like it could really
uh

01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
make happen any faster whether it
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
existed or not
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
i was wondering you know should this
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
then be confined really when also i
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
should say advocacy is done very well by
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
for example the american cancer society
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
and perhaps better than us but we could
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
do some would it be better that maybe
 
01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
this would focus primarily on the
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
questions of
 
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
when is it the right time that we would
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
be starting to
 
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
get this covered and how would we make
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
that covered
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of insurance or
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
medicaid we don't have control over
 
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
medicare obviously
 
01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:41.910 align:start position:0%
medicare obviously
um

01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
so that we can stay out of the science
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
and stay in the policy which is really
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
more what the legislature should be
 
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
doing would would that be a comfortable
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
option for you
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
that would be a comfortable option as i
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
said i don't want the perfect to be the
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
enemy of the good here
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
um we have goals we want to make sure
 
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
that there's um a stamp from the
 
01:24:04.149 --> 01:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
legislature that this is important
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
um and that it's important work to be
 
01:24:06.239 --> 01:24:07.110 align:start position:0%
um and that it's important work to be
done

01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
so however um
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
the wiggling or squirming needs to work
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
to make this work
 
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
i would be amenable too and as i said i
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
would just hope you work with the cancer
 
01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.070 align:start position:0%
would just hope you work with the cancer
folks

01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
on how you craft it to
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
to redo it a little
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh just to clarify uh representative as
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
i read through the bill it seems to me
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
that the about 90 percent of it is to do
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
with the task force
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
who's on it who appoints it what they do
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
and so on so there's really not a lot of
 
01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.110 align:start position:0%
and so on so there's really not a lot of
policy

01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
in this except to establish the task
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
force am i correct right to establish a
 
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
task force and to give the
 
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
the stamp of of the legislature wanting
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
to move forward on this kind of work
 
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:56.229 align:start position:0%
thank you

01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
shapiro
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
being a reasonably aware guy i'd never
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
heard of the words precision medicine or
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
barium or a biomarker testing
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
and seeing the spill and doing a little
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
research on my phone
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
i realized that my daughter
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
who was suddenly diagnosed two years ago
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
with terrible devastating cancer
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
has benefited by just this biomarker
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
testing where she was they they were
 
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
able to identify the specific mutation
 
01:25:32.239 --> 01:25:33.189 align:start position:0%
able to identify the specific mutation
and

01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
create a uh
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
you know a mutation specific medication
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
to target that genetic anomaly and
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
which has prolonged her life and given
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
her two great years
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
and so i'm so thankful for you bringing
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
this up
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
if anybody should be aware of this it
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
should be me and i was completely
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
unaware of it
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
well i i would believe that because as i
 
01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.910 align:start position:0%
well i i would believe that because as i
said

01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
when i first was diagnosed with cancer
 
01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
the cancer society worked with me to
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
develop this
 
01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:06.709 align:start position:0%
develop this
but

01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
i hadn't heard of biomarkers until
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
my oncologist brought it up to me and
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
started talking about it and since then
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
i have found um
 
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
i've done my own self-education a bit to
 
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
promote this so that people are aware of
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
it and more and more people that i
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
talked to
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
have reached out to folks they know and
 
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
found just as you did that it has played
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
a role um already in the number of
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
cancer treatments so the possibility for
 
01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
the future is is hopefully very large
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
and very positive that's why it's
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
important that this legislature says
 
01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:43.990 align:start position:0%
important that this legislature says
that

01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
in some form or other and that's why i'm
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
guess i'm willing to wiggle all over and
 
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
do any kind of amendments as long as we
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
can now
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
give the approval of this not the
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
approval but the legislature recognizing
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
this is a future that we need to look at
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:07.510 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
representative

01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcmahon thank you
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative rogers relative to the
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
description on page
 
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:16.870 align:start position:0%
description on page
one

01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
where it's stating the availability
 
01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:21.990 align:start position:0%
where it's stating the availability
of

01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
patient access
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
and in the interest of
 
01:27:26.639 --> 01:27:28.070 align:start position:0%
and in the interest of
possibly

01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
seen in other states
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
or other countries how this is being
 
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
accepted is there a existing paradigm
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
that could be used as an example right
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
now that you know about
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
of of these tests uh structurally being
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
available to patients
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna pass that question over to
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
some folks that follow me if you don't
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
mind because i would be answering just
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head and i really
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna ask that that you hold that
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
question for um someone that comes after
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%

01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
next up so he can prepare is
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%

01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
you can do that privately unless you
 
01:28:59.350 --> 01:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
want to announce it to everybody
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to need to be calling you
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
of course you can have my uh
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
cell phone is actually listed on the
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
american cancer society website so okay
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's not listed on the pink card well
 
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know you know why it wasn't because
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
i filled out the pin card without my
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
glasses so why don't i do this first all
 
01:29:14.639 --> 01:29:15.510 align:start position:0%
glasses so why don't i do this first all
right

right
 
01:29:17.110 --> 01:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
for the record mr chairman my name is
 
01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
michael rolo i am the government
 
01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
relations director for the american
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
cancer society here in new hampshire
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
and for all the world listening at home
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
where my cell phone number is everybody
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
pins ready go
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
are we ready
 
01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
six zero three
 
01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
six six one
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
eight nine seven four
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
those of you watching the video use that
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
oh i do not actually but they gave us
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
this one on top because it has our logo
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
on it so
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
but i don't have to wear it
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
but i can if you don't mind let me pass
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
up the written test
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
okay we get more of this there's more
 
01:29:58.639 --> 01:30:00.229 align:start position:0%
okay we get more of this there's more
okay

01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
only because
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
so i feel like most of my testimony has
 
01:30:28.149 --> 01:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
already been asked by representative gay
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative liam lyon i'm sorry
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
leon sorry mr pronounced it perhaps a
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
merchant representative weber
 
01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative salloway
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative canark and woods
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
but we should still do it anyways right
 
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you for for having such a very
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
spirited conversation about this
 
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
biomarker testing is
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
is really the way of the future in in
 
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
cancer care but it's already happening
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
now as well
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
and we'll get back to the actual
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
testimony but representative
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
gay had asked about medicare
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
it depends i guess it's the the best way
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
to answer it um
 
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
there are certain types of biomarker
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
testing happening right now they're even
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
covered by
 
01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
carriers within the state of new
 
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire so there are
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
more common ones for breast cancers for
 
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
instance for certain colon cancers
 
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
so it's not
 
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's not that it's not being covered
 
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.110 align:start position:0%
it's not that it's not being covered
completely

01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
completely
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
it's just that that i think the science
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
is probably outpacing
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
our ability to keep up legislatively so
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
and that would be part of i think the
 
01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:33.990 align:start position:0%
and that would be part of i think the
committee's

01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
committee's
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
scope um
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
i originally thought this might be a
 
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
stand-alone subcom
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
standalone committee rather
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative rogers thought it might
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
be a good idea to put it on the
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
oversight committee i leave that all to
 
01:31:45.679 --> 01:31:46.629 align:start position:0%
oversight committee i leave that all to
you

01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
our goal is to make sure that
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
this very important issue was studied as
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative rogers has said
 
01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:55.030 align:start position:0%
representative rogers has said
and

01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
legislative solutions are brought
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
forward but let me finish my
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
introduction so i'm mike rollo i'm the
 
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
government relations director for the
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
american cancer society cancer action
 
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:02.950 align:start position:0%
american cancer society cancer action
network

01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
network
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
acs can which is a mouthful
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
and we are a nonpartisan advocacy
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
organization we are the advocacy arm of
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
the american cancer society and we
 
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
advocate for public policies
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
and legislative solutions
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
that will help bring an end to
 
01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
cancer as a public health issue for
 
01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:22.470 align:start position:0%
cancer as a public health issue for
people

01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're here before you
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
today in full support of house bill 1290
 
01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
biomarker testing which is very
 
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
complicated and i'm not surprised
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative that you had never heard
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
of it because i'm not going to lie to
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
you i had never heard of it
 
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
and i do this i've been working for the
 
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
american cancer society this is starting
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
my 12th year
 
01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.629 align:start position:0%
my 12th year
so

01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to cover
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot to cover
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
biomarker testing in case you don't know
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
takes why don't we read what a
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
definition of biomarker testing is so
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
we're all on the same page biomarker
 
01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
testing is the analysis of a patient's
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
tissue blood or other biospecimen for
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
the presence of a biomarker
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
you say mike what is a biomarker
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
a biomarker is a sign of disease or
 
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
abnormal function that can be measured
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
in blood tissue or bodily fluid
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
and in cancer care biomarkers are often
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
used to help determine the best
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
treatment for a patient
 
01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:17.270 align:start position:0%
treatment for a patient
representative

01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
must represent a merchant i think must
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
have brought it up
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's like he had read my testimony ahead
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
of time which he hadn't and encrypt some
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
notes from it
 
01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:28.070 align:start position:0%
notes from it
but

01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
the triple aim of us wanting to make
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
sure that we we can expand access to to
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
biomarker testing
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
is for better health outcomes
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
improved quality of health and to reduce
 
01:33:40.239 --> 01:33:42.629 align:start position:0%
improved quality of health and to reduce
costs

01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
biomarker testing is a heck of a lot
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
cheaper than
 
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
going down a road of treatment that may
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
not work and then having to start over
 
01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:52.229 align:start position:0%
not work and then having to start over
again

01:33:52.229 --> 01:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
representative rogers had mentioned
 
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
she's exhausting
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
her current forms of chemotherapy and
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
they're talking about immunotherapy
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
which i don't want you to confuse with
 
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about today but the
 
01:34:05.669 --> 01:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
very large scary number that she threw
 
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
out at you is not made up those are real
 
01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:10.470 align:start position:0%
out at you is not made up those are real
figures

01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
figures
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
and that's um
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
that could be in addition to what's our
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
the system
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
whoever her carrier is that she has her
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
insurance through has already put into
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
this so
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
we're hoping through through more access
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
to biomarker testing we can get better
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
outcomes for patients and for the system
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
in general um access to clinical trial
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of all over the place because
 
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
you've already heard most of what this
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
is all about but access to clinical
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
trials really is very important
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
and there are many that won't let you in
 
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
unless you've had access to a biomarker
 
01:34:47.109 --> 01:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
test we only have one academic
 
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
medical institution in the state that's
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
dartmouth they do a fabulous job but
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
there are other options and avenues
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
available to patients that live in new
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire because we have such we're so
 
01:35:01.350 --> 01:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
close to some fine institutions
 
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
in boston and the greater boston area
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
you know there are limited access to to
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
those clinical trials based on access to
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
biomarker testing
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
and some of the the reasons why there
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
are there are issues to
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
folks accessing biomarker testing
 
01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
one of these days i'm getting used to
 
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
wearing these silly things uh improved
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
um coverage for borrow marker testing or
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
diminished based on
 
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
a number of things access to insurance
 
01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
we've already talked about that
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
where you live
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
those that live in more rural places
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
like new hampshire
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
or anyone who lives north of concord
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
understands that more than i guess folks
 
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
will live south and southeast of concord
 
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
but most of the state is rural
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
and if you're not getting you're
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
receiving your care through a non-a
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
non-academic center there are less like
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
there's a less likelihood that you would
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
even get access to a biomarker testing
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
we'd like to help solve that and that we
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
believe that this study is a great way
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
to start
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
representative connerk asked first and
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
then followed up by maybe sorry i'm
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
getting it backwards represent woods
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
asked first followed by representative
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
conner about uh amending
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
and actually several of you asked about
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
amending but
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
we would be fine with that um i think
 
01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
i've spoken to representative woods
 
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
separately and i don't disagree we can
 
01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
take out some of those pieces that he
 
01:36:25.119 --> 01:36:26.070 align:start position:0%
take out some of those pieces that he
finds

01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
finds
 
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
are overreaching um and over complicated
 
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
because my end of the day my goal is not
 
01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
to make things more complicated it's to
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
get folks more access to to this to this
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
testing and based on the conversations
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
and the study that comes out of
 
01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:42.629 align:start position:0%
and the study that comes out of
um

01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
this commission it could lead to a host
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
of things i mean it's not just we want
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
to make sure that everything is covered
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
and mandated by an insurance company i
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
mean there are access issues based on
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
on what's even suggested by your
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
physician so i mean i don't want anyone
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
to think the takeaway isn't that we're
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
trying to attack insurance companies
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
because in fact we want them on the
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
commission because we want them to help
 
01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
us study this
 
01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:05.350 align:start position:0%
us study this
um

01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to think of what else were
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
the questions that were asked that
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
you've got my written testimonials i'm
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
not i'm not one that likes to sit here
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
and read from and i'm sure you
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate that too but
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
um i wanted to answer one other question
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
that i'm happy to you can fire away at
 
01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
me but one of the ones that was asked
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
maybe it was my representative salloway
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
ah my mind is fading so why don't i just
 
01:37:24.719 --> 01:37:25.590 align:start position:0%
ah my mind is fading so why don't i just
stop

01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
stop
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind mr mr chairman and i'm
 
01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:28.550 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind mr mr chairman and i'm
gonna

01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
be ready to to to take the slings and
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
arrows it's only fair since you shared
 
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
your cell phone number representative
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
canark thank you um looking at your
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
written testimony and we look down at
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
the bottom under disparities in equal
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
access yes
 
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
given that the factors here that you
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
list are precisely the factors that are
 
01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:50.229 align:start position:0%
list are precisely the factors that are
actually

01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
universally across our entire healthcare
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
system not just for biomarker access
 
01:37:57.189 --> 01:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
but for any kind of treatment whether it
 
01:37:57.199 --> 01:37:59.990 align:start position:0%
but for any kind of treatment whether it
be

01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
maternity or just cancer treatment to
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
start with or anything
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
and certainly this is something we've
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
been exploring on the state health
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
assessment advisory council
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
it would seem like a lot of this is an
 
01:38:14.709 --> 01:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
indictment of our
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
poorly functioning health care system to
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
start with
 
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm not implying that we should
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
somehow fix the whole health care system
 
01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
but how do you think we're going to
 
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
somehow fix this one thing when we have
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
a health care system that has great
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
disparities built into it
 
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
and i i i don't when i was drafting this
 
01:38:39.189 --> 01:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
testimony i certainly wasn't trying to
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
indict the entire health care system but
 
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that's how you take it no i
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
did that wasn't my intention i assure
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
you but i only handle cancer i don't
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
handle everything else under the sun so
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
i would say that
 
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
the journey of a million miles starts
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
with one footstep in that
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
if you don't start somewhere you're not
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
going to get anywhere so
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
as i said my organization is concerned
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
with with cancer and how it affects the
 
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
approximately 8 600 people that are
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
going to be diagnosed with cancer this
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
year in the state of new hampshire alone
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
and we'd like to help expand that access
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
if i could though while
 
01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy i'm going to answer if i
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
see other hands going up i want to draw
 
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
your attention to the last page of my
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
testimony because it's not from me i
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
have a volunteer that wanted to be here
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
desperately this morning because it
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
affected her personally her name is
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
nancy kearney she lives in silver lake
 
01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
which i believe is your district
 
01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:31.830 align:start position:0%
which i believe is your district
representative

01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
um she had a doctor's appointment this
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
morning and i think all of you know that
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
it's difficult at best to get
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
appointments these days and she didn't
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
want to cancel not to try to reschedule
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
so she does apologize
 
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
but this is
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
what what we want to look at is actually
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
happening to people in this state so ms
 
01:39:49.590 --> 01:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
carney who is a volunteer with with our
 
01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:51.510 align:start position:0%
carney who is a volunteer with with our
organization

01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
as you can see in the testimony went
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
because to her doctor because she had
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
less serious mole on her back that would
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
need to be removed her family has a
 
01:40:02.639 --> 01:40:03.750 align:start position:0%
need to be removed her family has a
history

01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
of skin cancer she's very fair-skinned
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
so she wanted to have it taken off and
 
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
then she thought she'd go and have it
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
looked at and they'd make an appointment
 
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
in a few weeks and take it off the
 
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
doctor said no you know what we're going
 
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
to prep you right now we're taking it
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
off have you ever heard of something
 
01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
called melanoma
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
it's very serious it is the most it is
 
01:40:21.910 --> 01:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
the most deadly form of skin cancer that
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
um the doctor said but don't lose hope
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
there is something called biomarker
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
testing that we can have a biopsy of
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
this cell these cells and we can decide
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
what the best course of treatment will
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
be nancy said fabulous she volunteers
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
with the cancer society she wants a
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
positive outcome
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
she had already lost her husband at 30
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
years old to uh to raise her children by
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
herself to a very rare form of cancer so
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
she didn't really want to not see her
 
01:40:53.189 --> 01:40:53.199 align:start position:0%
grandchildren grow up so
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
she has a biopsy they send it off to a
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
lab in texas there's only one lab in the
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
entire country
 
01:41:01.590 --> 01:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
that takes care of this and guess what
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
that lab is not a network surprise
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
surprise because it's in texas
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
carriers do their best to try to create
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
networks but you can't fault them for
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
not having someone in texas
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
so but we want to look at that
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
it goes off it comes back they find the
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
best form of treatment she gets the
 
01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
treatment she's doing very well today
 
01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
she still has to go for follow-up visits
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
but she's doing very well
 
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
fast forward a few more months and i'm
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
getting another point i promise she got
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
a bill in the mail for 8 500
 
01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
for her test that was out of network
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh tough nut to swallow you know for
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
most people i don't know if i could
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
write a check for 8 500
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
i know i couldn't write a check for 8
 
01:41:40.639 --> 01:41:41.830 align:start position:0%
i know i couldn't write a check for 8
500

01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
500
 
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
to send off so that's why we want to
 
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
look at this i mean this is just one
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
story but it's happening to other people
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
in the state i mean these are real
 
01:41:50.790 --> 01:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
people this is not mike rollo and the
 
01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
cancer society is saying hey let's try
 
01:41:52.719 --> 01:41:53.590 align:start position:0%
cancer society is saying hey let's try
to

01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
find something to work on i've got
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
plenty to work on it's just
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
this is a serious issue so
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
and this is just one patient's story so
 
01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
a follow-up sir
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
may i see a follow-up i just sorry i did
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
not say that you uh were um criticizing
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
the healthcare system i did that oh you
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
do that okay you can do it all you want
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
that's fine so
 
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
since it you are focusing a lot on the
 
01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
coverage because that is really the
 
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
thing that we can maybe have an impact
 
01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
on and we can't make science necessarily
 
01:42:23.590 --> 01:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
work faster you would also be
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable with getting this down to
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
something that dealt primarily with
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
coverage issues and so on okay thank you
 
01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
i would the suggestions from from your
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
previously and from representative wood
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
about um um
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
clinical um laughter
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
so we actually read the actual phrase so
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
i don't get it wrong
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
clinical practice sorry we would be fine
 
01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
with taking that out
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
and you know and if if you want to amend
 
01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:48.639 align:start position:0%
this to be a stand-alone commission so
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
poor representative salloway doesn't get
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
tasked with doing it all by himself with
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
others that's okay too but i do make
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
this promise i'll help him
 
01:42:58.629 --> 01:42:58.639 align:start position:0%
me too okay that this is this is what
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be doing hopefully for the
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
next couple of years with you all so
 
01:43:03.199 --> 01:43:05.270 align:start position:0%
next couple of years with you all so
sorry

01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative leon a question for
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
mr rolo thank you mr chairman and thank
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
you mr roller for being here today
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
i actually have two questions hopefully
 
01:43:16.709 --> 01:43:16.719 align:start position:0%
i can ask the two the first is
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
i'm curious if you know how many
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
oncologists and specifically community
 
01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
oncologists there are in new hampshire
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
and if there is any way to reach them
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
with these innovative therapeutics and
 
01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:29.590 align:start position:0%
with these innovative therapeutics and
innovative

01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
innovative
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
treatments because that seems to be one
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
of the major barriers i do not have the
 
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
exact number of how many oncologists are
 
01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
currently employed in the state of new
 
01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:38.709 align:start position:0%
currently employed in the state of new
hampshire

01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
do like representative rogers did my
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
friend from the medical society who's
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
also here to testify in favor i think
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
he's still sitting behind me if he
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
didn't run away yet um might be able to
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
answer that although we so you know the
 
01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
i'm going to get the acronym wrong nicos
 
01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
the new england
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
the northern new england clinical
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
oncologist society
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
their acronym their name is even longer
 
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
than ours nicos
 
01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
has been working on this issue their
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
parent organization which is asco which
 
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
is the american society of clinical
 
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
oncologists um has been working on this
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
issue across the country and they can
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
probably their their representative
 
01:44:16.629 --> 01:44:16.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't available today to come but i can
 
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
um i can certainly try to get that
 
01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
information from them for you because
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
they would they would want to be
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
involved as well with helping
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
with this so that's fantastic to hear
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
that nekos is involved there
 
01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
my second question is uh when in my
 
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
previous job i worked in a lot of
 
01:44:33.669 --> 01:44:33.679 align:start position:0%
diagnostics oncology diagnostics as well
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
and dealt with reimbursement at the
 
01:44:37.109 --> 01:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
medicaid medicare level
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
and um working with that understanding
 
01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
that there are cost savings when you can
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
target the therapy only to those who
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
will benefit but understanding just how
 
01:44:49.109 --> 01:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
complex the entire entire reimbursement
 
01:44:50.470 --> 01:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
landscape is
 
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know that that's something we
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
could actually address here in new
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire so i'm curious how increasing
 
01:44:58.709 --> 01:44:58.719 align:start position:0%
increasing awareness and reaching out to
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
those oncologists to make sure that it's
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
a ground-up uprising uh might
 
01:45:05.590 --> 01:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
actually get better treatment better
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
care to our patients without running up
 
01:45:09.669 --> 01:45:09.679 align:start position:0%
into a federal brick wall right i agree
 
01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
with you you you will not be able to
 
01:45:12.629 --> 01:45:12.639 align:start position:0%
solve and i think representative connor
 
01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
might have mentioned this as well you
 
01:45:17.590 --> 01:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
cannot solve the medicare issue that's
 
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
a few 100 miles to the south of us
 
01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
they're allegedly working and actually
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
there is a bill to address this
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
nationally as well
 
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
i think you'll probably pass something
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire a lot quicker but um
 
01:45:31.030 --> 01:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
they will in washington um but we can
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
affect positive change for people that
 
01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:33.430 align:start position:0%
affect positive change for people that
are

01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:34.149 align:start position:0%
are
uh

01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
with private insurance and potentially
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
medicaid as well if that's what you want
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
to go that route is rooted as well
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
but you're right you won't be able to do
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
anything about medicare
 
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
taking my questions i never seem to get
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
one boil down um it
 
01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
is this
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
am i correct in assuming that the real
 
01:45:58.560 --> 01:45:59.669 align:start position:0%
am i correct in assuming that the real
singular

01:45:59.669 --> 01:45:59.679 align:start position:0%
singular
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
purpose of this commission is to get
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
care to people
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
which means which means we have to find
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
a way to get it paid for
 
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
as well as notify people make sure
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
but do you really have a hard time
 
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
getting to reach oncologists since it
 
01:46:19.590 --> 01:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
seems like they would be really
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
fascinated with every tool
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
accessible to them well i don't want to
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
speak for the oncologist as a whole
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
but i do know that um
 
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
we have had volunteers in the past tell
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
us that they had issues
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
with access to clinical trials they
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
hadn't never heard of it i think much
 
01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:39.590 align:start position:0%
hadn't never heard of it i think much
like

01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative merchant not merchant i'm
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
sorry so shapiro shapiro sitting next to
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
him um had mentioned
 
01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
they may have actually said it look i
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
i have
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
now lost let's see in the last
 
01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:54.629 align:start position:0%
now lost let's see in the last
30

01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
30
 
01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
no sorry i don't exaggerate 28 years
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
my father
 
01:47:01.590 --> 01:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
two aunts and an uncle
 
01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
to to various forms of cancer
 
01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
we are now helping a dear friend of ours
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
who's got a cancer diagnosis and and my
 
01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
wife's grandmother is going through a
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
lung cancer treatment
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
as caregivers
 
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
yeah cancer affects everyone in the
 
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire as you know
 
01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:17.990 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire as you know
representative

01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
when you are dealing with this diagnosis
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
they may have actually said it to you
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
when you hear those those little words
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
you have cancer it's like charlie
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
brown's teacher is talking to you right
 
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
you're hearing this
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
in your ear so i'm not trying to
 
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
disparage the the medical community but
 
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
not all
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
oncologists are probably created equal i
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
think we can agree on that i mean there
 
01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:38.470 align:start position:0%
think we can agree on that i mean there
are

01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
different doctors doing different things
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
all over the world so
 
01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
and they you know i i
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
i think it depends i mean i don't i
 
01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to paint any one person in a
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
box i think it just depends on where
 
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative gay thank you
 
01:47:57.679 --> 01:47:59.270 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative gay thank you
so

01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:01.510 align:start position:0%
so
pr

01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
pr
 
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
educating people is really a big deal it
 
01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:08.719 align:start position:0%
is indeed yes and i do agree because i
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
i just found out about proton radiation
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
and there may be one
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
in new england
 
01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
and one in houston and you know it's
 
01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
just not
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
common but it's there
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
they're the
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
the good thing if you have want to say
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
one good thing about cancer i don't
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
typically have many good things to say
 
01:48:29.189 --> 01:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
it is an ever-evolving science
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
and we have made terrific
 
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
amazing strides in the last
 
01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
decade or two in treating
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
certain types of cancers and making them
 
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
chronic illnesses not death sentences as
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
they would have been at one time
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
but that's only come out of research
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
and as you say pr i mean
 
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of what i work on is also about
 
01:48:58.229 --> 01:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
prevention um
 
01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
getting people to to get their
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
preventative screenings for instance
 
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
getting them not to smoke um
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
those things you know trying to help
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
people before they develop a cancer but
 
01:49:10.229 --> 01:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
i think you're absolutely 100 correct
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
part of this also would be looking at
 
01:49:14.709 --> 01:49:14.719 align:start position:0%
how are our patients receiving or not
 
01:49:16.709 --> 01:49:16.719 align:start position:0%
receiving this information
 
01:49:16.719 --> 01:49:17.830 align:start position:0%
receiving this information
um

01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a lot to take on for
 
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
sure and and i don't think it's going to
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
be solved in in a month or two it's it's
 
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
a it's a multi-year again i'm sorry
 
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
represents all the way a multi-year
 
01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:30.350 align:start position:0%
and representative pearson a multi-year
 
01:49:30.350 --> 01:49:31.830 align:start position:0%
and representative pearson a multi-year
[Music]

01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:49:33.589 --> 01:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
approach it truly has to be if you're
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
going to do this
 
01:49:35.590 --> 01:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
do this
 
01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:37.669 align:start position:0%
do this
[Music]

01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
correctly i mean i could have asked
 
01:49:40.709 --> 01:49:40.719 align:start position:0%
representative rogers hey you know what
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
these big bad insurance companies aren't
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
covering everything under the sun let's
 
01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
put in a mandate to do that and john
 
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
hunt who was my chairman at one time
 
01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
would laugh me out of the room and tell
 
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
me to go back to well he thinks he
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't i don't think he knows where i
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
live anymore but he told me to go back
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
to the cecos
 
01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:56.470 align:start position:0%
to the cecos
um

01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
and rightfully so because it's not as
 
01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:00.639 align:start position:0%
thought out i mean i think this is a
 
01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
very serious issue that needs a very
 
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
serious study so i think i've answered
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
more than you probably wanted to hear
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
but i'm sorry it's
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's a passion it's not
 
01:50:10.950 --> 01:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
questions for mr rolo before we move on
 
01:50:13.109 --> 01:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
to other speakers representative soloway
 
01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
you get your vengeance
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh it's nice to
 
01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
have you here mr rolo you have your
 
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
testimony of course always comes highly
 
01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
praised by one of my county
 
01:50:23.599 --> 01:50:24.790 align:start position:0%
praised by one of my county
commissioners

01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
i did a little bias man
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
i wonder if you could track for the
 
01:50:30.239 --> 01:50:31.350 align:start position:0%
i wonder if you could track for the
committee

01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
the transition that's occurred in
 
01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:35.430 align:start position:0%
the transition that's occurred in
oncology

01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
oncology
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
from primary diagnosis by sight of
 
01:50:39.199 --> 01:50:40.629 align:start position:0%
from primary diagnosis by sight of
diagnosis

01:50:40.629 --> 01:50:40.639 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
to biomarkers for diagnosis and why that
 
01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
is vitally important
 
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
can you do that for us if
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
if you can't that's fine i'll understand
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
but it
 
01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
i thought it was so important
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
that you might want to educate us right
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
well i will do my best and i i am
 
01:51:01.589 --> 01:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
i i'm going to give this caveat i am not
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
a medical doctor i am
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
to my my right i'm flanked by two um
 
01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:09.669 align:start position:0%
to my my right i'm flanked by two um
very

01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
very esteemed physicians so
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna do my best and they can stick
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
her and laugh at me after i leave but
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
and that's okay um
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
if i'm understanding your question
 
01:51:19.679 --> 01:51:22.149 align:start position:0%
if i'm understanding your question
correctly

01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
how let me ask it back to make sure i'm
 
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
understanding i don't want to ramble on
 
01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
and it's not what you wanted to hear um
 
01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
okay i can do that
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
you want to know
 
01:51:30.719 --> 01:51:32.390 align:start position:0%
you want to know
how

01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:33.270 align:start position:0%
how
how

01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
a biomarker
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
test at the beginning of diagnosis can
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
help with treatment or i might not be
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
understanding your question i'm sorry um
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
there's been a transition in
 
01:51:46.709 --> 01:51:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh oncologic diagnosis
 
01:51:46.719 --> 01:51:47.510 align:start position:0%
uh oncologic diagnosis
from

01:51:47.510 --> 01:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
diagnosis based on primary site of tumor
 
01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay biomarkers okay yes so
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
you're correct so i try not to get
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not a technical person again i'm not
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
a doctor but i will i will do my best so
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
i think what you're asking me is
 
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
at one time
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
they would have diagnosed the cancer
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
they would have been let's make it very
 
01:52:10.719 --> 01:52:11.669 align:start position:0%
they would have been let's make it very
easy

01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
easy
 
01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
there is a tumor
 
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
you pick wherever you want it to be they
 
01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
would cut it out
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
and they may
 
01:52:21.189 --> 01:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
that may be it or they may have to then
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
do radiation to shrink the tumor because
 
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
they can't cut it out
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
or they're going to pump you full of
 
01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:28.390 align:start position:0%
or they're going to pump you full of
poisons

01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
poisons
 
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
also known as chemotherapy to kill all
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
the cells and hopefully kill all the
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
cancer cells and not hopefully all the
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
ones that are keeping you alive at the
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
same time
 
01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:37.990 align:start position:0%
same time
um

01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
and then they would
 
01:52:42.149 --> 01:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully would go into remission and
 
01:52:44.709 --> 01:52:44.719 align:start position:0%
you would have a few years hopefully
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
of positive life left right is that
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
and then now
 
01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:49.330 align:start position:0%
and then now
um

01:52:49.330 --> 01:52:49.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:51.430 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
i think that well let me
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's practically part of my testimony i
 
01:52:56.229 --> 01:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
didn't read so maybe you're doing me a
 
01:52:57.750 --> 01:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
favor i appreciate this representative
 
01:52:57.760 --> 01:52:58.790 align:start position:0%
favor i appreciate this representative
because

01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes a little scatter brain
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
very scatter brain 37 of the 62 oncology
 
01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
drugs launched in the past five years
 
01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
have required or are recommended that
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
your buyer test be used prior to use
 
01:53:13.679 --> 01:53:15.030 align:start position:0%

therapies
 
01:53:21.669 --> 01:53:21.679 align:start position:0%
most of the therapies these days are
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
targeted they're using precision
 
01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:25.189 align:start position:0%

01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.199 align:start position:0%

01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
things like representative rogers has
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
just mentioned immunotherapies
 
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
where they are able to rep take your
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
cells or your
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
part of you let's just say that i don't
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
want to misspeak and and create
 
01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:48.709 align:start position:0%
want to misspeak and and create
a

01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:48.719 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
a treatment based on your genetic
 
01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
structure your genetic makeup of your
 
01:53:54.159 --> 01:53:55.350 align:start position:0%
structure your genetic makeup of your
cells

01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
cells
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
or or the cancer cell rather
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
to combat that specific cancer based in
 
01:54:03.669 --> 01:54:03.679 align:start position:0%
your body not just let's stick an iv
 
01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
drip in you and hope for the best
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
they're very expensive
 
01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:09.109 align:start position:0%
they're very expensive
and

01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
we we're not talking about that at the
 
01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
moment but that's another separate issue
 
01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
but that we're not going to solve here
 
01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:14.550 align:start position:0%
but that we're not going to solve here
but

01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:16.149 align:start position:0%
but
um

01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:16.159 --> 01:54:16.870 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
treatments today
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
not all
 
01:54:24.629 --> 01:54:24.639 align:start position:0%
but are moving more towards how do we
 
01:54:24.639 --> 01:54:25.589 align:start position:0%
but are moving more towards how do we
best

01:54:25.589 --> 01:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
best
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
suit the treatment to the individual and
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
not the this is all we have let's throw
 
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
the kitchen sink at it approach
 
01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:36.750 align:start position:0%
and and a big piece of being able to
 
01:54:36.750 --> 01:54:38.390 align:start position:0%
and and a big piece of being able to
[Music]

01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:54:41.589 --> 01:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
utilize these new very specific targeted
 
01:54:44.229 --> 01:54:44.239 align:start position:0%
therapies are based on
 
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
what the biomarkers are if there are any
 
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
of the particular type of cancer they
 
01:54:52.629 --> 01:54:52.639 align:start position:0%
are trying to eradicate
 
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%

01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman pearson members of
 
01:55:35.589 --> 01:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record john
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
williams the director of legislative
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
affairs for the department of health and
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
human services and with me is
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
janice emery legal resident at the
 
01:55:44.830 --> 01:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
department under mr
 
01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
williams and we're here just to make
 
01:55:49.109 --> 01:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
three three primary points one is we
 
01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
want to thank the prime sponsored bill
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative kathy rogers for bringing
 
01:55:55.109 --> 01:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
this important legislation before this
 
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
committee as we've seen in evolving
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
science whether it's the internet
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's 5g technology as you
 
01:56:01.709 --> 01:56:01.719 align:start position:0%
probably know
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
represent a group to research that the
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
goal here is to get ahead of the at
 
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
least the technology and access to
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
healthcare and we do think that that's
 
01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
exactly what uh reference rogers is
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish with this
 
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
legislation so that's point number one
 
01:56:19.109 --> 01:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
point number two is how do we advance
 
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
this um well-intended uh and an
 
01:56:23.589 --> 01:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
important initiative going forward and
 
01:56:25.270 --> 01:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
as we know from prior bills that have
 
01:56:26.709 --> 01:56:26.719 align:start position:0%
come before this committee dealing with
 
01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
either study committees
 
01:56:31.589 --> 01:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
or similar entities there is a very
 
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
conscientious approach by the leadership
 
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
to reduce the number of those entities
 
01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
that are out there so really there's two
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
paths that this committee could follow
 
01:56:43.109 --> 01:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
the one that was suggested by rev weber
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
earlier on when she identified pursuant
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
to and i'll speak slowly at this point a
 
01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:52.639 align:start position:0%
person went to rsa 126 colon 15
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
roman 2. there's a mechanism for the
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
committee as we know from chairman
 
01:56:58.629 --> 01:56:58.639 align:start position:0%
pearson who serves in both capacities
 
01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
here on the policy committee as well as
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
the chair for hhs oversight the ability
 
01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
to create councils task force
 
01:57:06.070 --> 01:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and it actually identifies
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
task force as being one of the entities
 
01:57:09.430 --> 01:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
that can be created
 
01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:10.470 align:start position:0%
that can be created
the

01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
upside of that for consideration of the
 
01:57:15.669 --> 01:57:15.679 align:start position:0%
committee and the legislature is that
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
you could convene
 
01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
a study committee task force much more
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
efficiently and faster than the proposed
 
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
legislation would be able to be enacted
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
before the committee the downside is it
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
does sunset at the end of the biennium
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
just like the
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
oversight committee itself and would
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
have to be reconstituted in the next
 
01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
biennium the legislation before you has
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
a sunset provision for november 1st of
 
01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
2024 so it in essence caught it
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
conceptually puts forward the idea of
 
01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
going into the next biennium so there is
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
a mechanism to doing that either in
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
existing law that allows the oversight
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
committee to establish a task force like
 
01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
this and in fact this legislation can be
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
used as a charter for that provision as
 
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
also appropriate accurately identified
 
01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
by representative weber there is a
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
requirement that a legislator is not
 
01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
actually a committee member but a
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
legislator does have to serve on the
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
task force in this occasion and also
 
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
would have to be the um would have to be
 
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
the chair of that committee as well one
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
item that is missing and i worked with
 
01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
our law clerk who recently drafted up a
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
legislation around a commission it does
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
um does not contain in the legislation a
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
provision for quorum requirement uh and
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
it also doesn't um specify when the
 
01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
first meeting is to be called by and
 
01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
whom by is going to be called the first
 
01:58:37.589 --> 01:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
meeting so those are just a couple of
 
01:58:40.229 --> 01:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
technical issues to look at okay third
 
01:58:40.239 --> 01:58:41.510 align:start position:0%
technical issues to look at okay third
part

01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
the belief is that the drafters at the
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
office of legislative services utilized
 
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
an existing permanent
 
01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:49.669 align:start position:0%
an existing permanent
commission

01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
rather committee under hhs oversight so
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
another rsa that i'll speak slowly at
 
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
this point which is rsa 126
 
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
a 15 lower case a which in 2014 and uh
 
01:59:04.629 --> 01:59:04.639 align:start position:0%
and i know several of you who are still
 
01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
with us from that era uh worked with us
 
01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
on that legislation to establish a
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
permanent subcommittee under the
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
oversight committee for alzheimer's and
 
01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
related dementia so there is a
 
01:59:16.950 --> 01:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
president for what is trying to be
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
accomplished here within the task force
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
and what they are tending to do is after
 
01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
that particular
 
01:59:26.070 --> 01:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
committee on alzheimer's and related
 
01:59:27.669 --> 01:59:27.679 align:start position:0%
dimension they're creating a new
 
01:59:30.149 --> 01:59:30.159 align:start position:0%
subsection 15 lowercase b that's what
 
01:59:32.550 --> 01:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
this legislation does and it does mirror
 
01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
the language actually of that permanent
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee the difference here is this
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
would be a sunsetted
 
01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
provision not a permanent group as
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
before so the fact that it's already
 
01:59:44.950 --> 01:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
contemplated that they're not intending
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
to be a permanent commission which i
 
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
think is distinguishable which is my
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
last point about the existing alzheimer
 
01:59:52.390 --> 01:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
dementia uh we we are certainly fully
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
supportive of this issue being addressed
 
01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh by the legislature and we applaud the
 
01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
efforts of the prime sponsor for the
 
01:59:58.719 --> 01:59:59.510 align:start position:0%
efforts of the prime sponsor for the
bill

01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:00:01.669 --> 02:00:01.679 align:start position:0%
i intended that we probably might get a
 
02:00:03.189 --> 02:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
question regarding application to
 
02:00:04.709 --> 02:00:04.719 align:start position:0%
medicaid as it relates to it and i can
 
02:00:06.149 --> 02:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
reserve questions but those are
 
02:00:08.310 --> 02:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
essentially my three points unless the
 
02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
wonderful soon-to-be attorney some in
 
02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
the near future janice has
 
02:00:15.669 --> 02:00:15.679 align:start position:0%
miss emery would have anything to add
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
i think that mr williams covered the two
 
02:00:19.669 --> 02:00:19.679 align:start position:0%
just minor
 
02:00:22.229 --> 02:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
things within the bill um the technical
 
02:00:24.070 --> 02:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
discrepancies and so i think that i have
 
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
nothing further to add at the moment
 
02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
thank you spoken like a good friel thank
 
02:00:28.159 --> 02:00:29.910 align:start position:0%
thank you spoken like a good friel thank
you

02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative canuck a quick question
 
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
you mentioned medicaid do we have the
 
02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639 align:start position:0%
authority to uh
 
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
to change coverage and get coverage for
 
02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:39.669 align:start position:0%
to change coverage and get coverage for
this

02:00:39.669 --> 02:00:39.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
in medicaid
 
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
that is that is a good question and i
 
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
would imagine that when this group is
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
constituted we would have um a subject
 
02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
matter expert from the department to
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
come here a mind is jane hitch
 
02:00:55.589 --> 02:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
jane is a registered nurse who also is
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
very much involved with the
 
02:00:58.320 --> 02:00:59.990 align:start position:0%
very much involved with the
medicaid

02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:01:02.310 --> 02:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
and what is covered under medicaid for
 
02:01:04.470 --> 02:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
provisions i spoke with miss hitch prior
 
02:01:06.070 --> 02:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
to this meeting just confirmed that we
 
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
do in fact receive from the managed care
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
organizations as resident land had
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
pointed out for targeted therapy we do
 
02:01:15.750 --> 02:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
actually now uh specify and work on a
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis for appropriate
 
02:01:19.510 --> 02:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
medication based upon these kind of
 
02:01:21.109 --> 02:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
tests for uh
 
02:01:23.830 --> 02:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
for genetic markers so we do currently
 
02:01:25.510 --> 02:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
do that on a case-by-case basis but
 
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
certainly from an access standpoint and
 
02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
globally as it goes from a case-by-case
 
02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
basis uh looking at a more global for a
 
02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
actual um not having to do it on
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:42.070 --> 02:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question now that you have
 
02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
showed us multiple multiple avenues
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
towards creating study committees are
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
fancier than committees
 
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
is there any way that we could start a
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
committee now
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
that leads then would be adopted if we
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
pass this you know modify this to to say
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
the right thing
 
02:02:09.669 --> 02:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
can we start now
 
02:02:12.550 --> 02:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
bless it with the the bill
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
that would adopt it
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
so that we wouldn't have to wait until
 
02:02:19.109 --> 02:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
it was signed by the governor it could
 
02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
start but then it would become
 
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
legal or
 
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
more permanent buy the bill
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
so that it could continue
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
since you said this already is
 
02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
thinking enough to get to 2024 but
 
02:02:38.229 --> 02:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
isn't there some way to get it started
 
02:02:38.239 --> 02:02:39.750 align:start position:0%
isn't there some way to get it started
now

02:02:39.750 --> 02:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:43.270 align:start position:0%
now
yes

02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:45.589 align:start position:0%
 
brevity

02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
brevity

engage the the medical community uh on
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
what our thoughts were around this bill
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
so i spoke with some folks um in the
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
oncology community in the pathology
 
02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
community just to get a sense of where
 
02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
they um might stand any feedback that
 
02:03:41.669 --> 02:03:41.679 align:start position:0%
they might have
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
and in general um you know this was an
 
02:03:46.709 --> 02:03:46.719 align:start position:0%
issue access to biomarker testing
 
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
that they were supportive of and when it
 
02:03:50.950 --> 02:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
came to setting up a task force
 
02:03:52.550 --> 02:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
you folks will all you know decide kind
 
02:03:55.510 --> 02:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
of what form that takes um but they were
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh in general very supportive and would
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
just love to be involved in whatever
 
02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:02.079 align:start position:0%

question from representative leon

taking my question
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
when we look at this list of incredible
 
02:04:41.510 --> 02:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
people that need to be on this task
 
02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:42.790 align:start position:0%
people that need to be on this task
force

02:04:42.790 --> 02:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
force
 
02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
we have a hard time
 
02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
finding people to serve
 
02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:49.679 align:start position:0%
you've talked with your oncologist and
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
pathologists and i'm wondering are they
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
showing a willingness
 
02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
to uh get their feet dirty and come join
 
02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
some legislators
 
02:05:01.030 --> 02:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
and be a part of the task force do you
 
02:05:02.709 --> 02:05:02.719 align:start position:0%
think you would be able to help us
 
02:05:04.390 --> 02:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
recruit those people yeah thank you for
 
02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
the question and the answer is
 
02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes that was actually really
 
02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
the first thing that i talked to them
 
02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
about was i said you know
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
can you start engaging your community to
 
02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
find out maybe who would be the right
 
02:05:16.550 --> 02:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
experts to be part of this and there's
 
02:05:18.550 --> 02:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
an email chain going on right now
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
so uh certainly happy to follow up
 
02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
however you want to list that in the
 
02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill whether it's the medical society
 
02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:25.040 align:start position:0%

turn a gathering
 
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
like being on the commission
 
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
to turn that into something that the
 
02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
doctors who participate would get
 
02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
continuing education

behalf of the doctors uh they are always
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
looking for opportunities to do that i
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if that would be the case but
 
02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
as my role within the medical society
 
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's probably one of the things that i
 
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
can do so i'll um i guess what i'll do
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
is as this continues to move forward
 
02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
i'll explore you know what that might
 
02:06:16.709 --> 02:06:16.719 align:start position:0%
look like because um the short answer is
 
02:06:18.550 --> 02:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know but
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative leon last question
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to see if you could reach
 
02:06:32.390 --> 02:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
out to new hampshire on hematology
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
oncology they're involved with the main
 
02:06:36.550 --> 02:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
cancer genomics initiative which is
 
02:06:38.069 --> 02:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
working out of the jackson lab that
 
02:06:40.629 --> 02:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
makes the jax mice it sounds like maine
 
02:06:42.709 --> 02:06:42.719 align:start position:0%
has an amazing system going in order to
 
02:06:44.950 --> 02:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
spread this into community oncology and
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
if we can take their best practices or
 
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
maybe glom onto our neighbor and work
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
with them we might be able to solve this
 
02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
problem so i'd appreciate if you could
 
02:06:54.149 --> 02:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
help us with that would you be able to
 
02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
definitely and i was just taking down a
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
note and what i'll do is i'll follow up
 
02:06:58.310 --> 02:06:58.320 align:start position:0%

weber sorry
 
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:12.149 --> 02:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
thank you as a quick note on the
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
participation issue
 
02:07:16.149 --> 02:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
would it not be easier
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
to find participants both from your
 
02:07:20.950 --> 02:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
organizations and other organizations
 
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
from people who are very busy if this
 
02:07:25.510 --> 02:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
legislature chose to allow remote
 
02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:27.669 align:start position:0%
legislature chose to allow remote
participation

02:07:27.669 --> 02:07:27.679 align:start position:0%
participation
 
02:07:27.679 --> 02:07:29.030 align:start position:0%
participation
um

02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:30.629 --> 02:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:07:33.030 --> 02:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
certainly that is always um does make
 
02:07:35.109 --> 02:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
participation easier um a number of the
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
folks who i have spoken with are from
 
02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
the dartmouth-hitchcock
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
community and you know considering that
 
02:07:42.390 --> 02:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
is about an hour away from here uh
 
02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
remote technology would make that a
 
02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
little easier so i'll leave that all to
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
you but i'll certainly say it would be
 
02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:48.069 align:start position:0%
you but i'll certainly say it would be
easier

02:07:48.069 --> 02:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
easier
 
02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr padmore and with that i
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
closed the hearing on house bill 1290
 
02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:54.390 align:start position:0%
closed the hearing on house bill 1290
now

02:07:54.390 --> 02:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
before we get off that topic even though
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
the hearing itself has been closed
 
02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing that it would be a good idea
 
02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
for a work group to be convened to look
 
02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
at a number of the possibilities and
 
02:08:09.669 --> 02:08:09.679 align:start position:0%
options that we have heard
 
02:08:12.310 --> 02:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering who might like to be
 
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
representative leon representative
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
gay any anyone else we could use
 
02:08:30.149 --> 02:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
probably two or three more a question mr
 
02:08:31.350 --> 02:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
would you prefer to wait for the meeting
 
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
a week from friday of the oversight
 
02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:39.430 align:start position:0%
a week from friday of the oversight
committee

02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:08:42.149 --> 02:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
and to ask the oversight committee to
 
02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
move forward in that direction
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative williams needs to be in
 
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
on this
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not representative but john esquire
 
02:08:55.510 --> 02:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
the question from representative soloway
 
02:08:58.149 --> 02:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
was did it seem good to put this on
 
02:09:01.510 --> 02:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
oversight's agenda a week from friday
 
02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
and as the committee chair if you
 
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
instruct me it will be on the agenda
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
could you stretch our two hours to make
 
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
it seem shorter because we got a lot of
 
02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
stuff on the plate we actually do have
 
02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
quite a bit on the agenda for this
 
02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:20.870 --> 02:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
let me consider it i would like to go
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
forward with the work group
 
02:09:25.430 --> 02:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
even if oversight just makes some
 
02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:26.790 align:start position:0%
even if oversight just makes some
decisions

02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh two different sets of minds
 
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
can then bounce off each other
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh anybody else thank you rep
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
i keep demoting you um
 
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
any other representative
 
02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
wish to be
 
02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
on the work group i have woods leon and
 
02:09:48.069 --> 02:09:48.079 align:start position:0%
gay presently i would like a few more
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
did i i don't see a hand i should
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
probably not be on this actually um
 
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
all right rep uh you don't want to be on
 
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's what the kick under the table was
 
02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:22.310 align:start position:0%
that's what the kick under the table was
okay

02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:40.400 align:start position:0%

um this committee i also serve on ways
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
and means in jalcar and this committee
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
though is probably becoming one of my
 
02:14:02.310 --> 02:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
favorites to come visit because
 
02:14:03.990 --> 02:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's your gregarious chairman
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
and his wit that he applies and the
 
02:14:08.229 --> 02:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
intelligent questions the committee asks
 
02:14:10.830 --> 02:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your discernment
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
so i introduced this bill uh we've seen
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
this bill before
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
this bill uh makes a change to our
 
02:14:25.109 --> 02:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
current law regarding the vaccine
 
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
registry um one of the reasons for this
 
02:14:30.069 --> 02:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
bill as as we've stated before is that i
 
02:14:31.750 --> 02:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
i think it might be interesting to
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
understand that in our current law under
 
02:14:37.030 --> 02:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
um 141c 20
 
02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:38.390 align:start position:0%
um 141c 20
f

02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
f
 
02:14:39.910 --> 02:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
nowhere does it use the word opt-in or
 
02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:40.950 align:start position:0%
nowhere does it use the word opt-in or
opt-out

02:14:40.950 --> 02:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
opt-out
 
02:14:43.109 --> 02:14:43.119 align:start position:0%
not in one single place or the entire
 
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
law is that defined that's defined by
 
02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
the department they decided what was
 
02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
going to happen to this registry and how
 
02:14:49.990 --> 02:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
it was going to be treated
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking to define that
 
02:14:55.430 --> 02:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
considering again we go back to um
 
02:14:57.430 --> 02:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons for this bill
 
02:14:59.910 --> 02:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
is our constitution right and i've made
 
02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
this statement before in front of the
 
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
committee we know that in 2018
 
02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
when i served my first term there was a
 
02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment that was voted
 
02:15:09.189 --> 02:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
on in the house that passed both the
 
02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
house and senate ended up on the ballot
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
in november of 2019
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
that ballot asked the citizens a simple
 
02:15:17.830 --> 02:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
question shall we add this new amendment
 
02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
to our constitution the amendment read
 
02:15:22.149 --> 02:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
right of privacy an individual's right
 
02:15:22.159 --> 02:15:22.870 align:start position:0%
right of privacy an individual's right
to

02:15:22.870 --> 02:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
to live free from governmental intrusion
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
and private or personal information is
 
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
natural essential and inherent
 
02:15:31.669 --> 02:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
so we passed that that we passed out of
 
02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
the house we passed out of the senate
 
02:15:34.709 --> 02:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
with the two-thirds requirement it went
 
02:15:37.750 --> 02:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
on the ballot over 85 percent of new
 
02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens said that is
 
02:15:41.189 --> 02:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
important and we want to change our
 
02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
constitution to include that provision
 
02:15:46.629 --> 02:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
that government should not uh intrude
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
upon public um
 
02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
private information
 
02:15:52.550 --> 02:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
so this bill again in the opt-in
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
provision um kind of takes a invert
 
02:15:57.189 --> 02:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
inverted action it assumes that the
 
02:15:59.589 --> 02:15:59.599 align:start position:0%
citizen wants the data to be included
 
02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
and then makes them ask it for it not to
 
02:16:03.350 --> 02:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
be is that what they that's what their
 
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
rules currently say i'm looking to
 
02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
invert that i think the citizens right
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
privacy needs to be explicit that you
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
need to tell a citizen when the state is
 
02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
going to collect your data
 
02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's the most important part that
 
02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:15.669 align:start position:0%
that's the most important part that
constitutional

02:16:15.669 --> 02:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
02:16:17.430 --> 02:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
provision kind of clearly says that if
 
02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
you're going to collect my data you have
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
to be explicitly asking me for it before
 
02:16:22.149 --> 02:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
you start collecting and don't default
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
out default to collect it unless i say i
 
02:16:26.149 --> 02:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
don't want it the constitution says
 
02:16:26.159 --> 02:16:27.510 align:start position:0%
don't want it the constitution says
otherwise

02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:29.270 align:start position:0%
otherwise
um

02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
i work at technology as i've told you
 
02:16:32.469 --> 02:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
i've told this committee before the
 
02:16:32.479 --> 02:16:33.669 align:start position:0%
i've told this committee before the
default

02:16:33.669 --> 02:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
default
 
02:16:35.830 --> 02:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
for privacy officers in the normal
 
02:16:38.709 --> 02:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
technology world the default is opt in
 
02:16:40.309 --> 02:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
that's the default provision of most
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
privacy officers you need to ask
 
02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
somebody for their data before you start
 
02:16:46.629 --> 02:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
collecting their data so you've all
 
02:16:47.990 --> 02:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
bought bought
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
things online i'm sure and there's that
 
02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
checkbox that says hey do you want to
 
02:16:53.589 --> 02:16:53.599 align:start position:0%
receive our emails right do you want to
 
02:16:55.030 --> 02:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
do that but you have to check the box
 
02:16:56.469 --> 02:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
you have to say yes you have to give
 
02:16:58.150 --> 02:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
permission for that activity it's a
 
02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
default action for technology is to ask
 
02:17:02.790 --> 02:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
permission to
 
02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear in a little while
 
02:17:09.429 --> 02:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
how important this database is and i
 
02:17:10.469 --> 02:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
actually don't disagree with that
 
02:17:11.669 --> 02:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
statement that this is an important
 
02:17:13.509 --> 02:17:13.519 align:start position:0%
database to use
 
02:17:13.519 --> 02:17:15.030 align:start position:0%
database to use
however

02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:15.910 align:start position:0%
however
i

02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
find it somewhat disingenuous in that
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
you if you understand this uh registry
 
02:17:26.469 --> 02:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
it was originally authorized in 1998
 
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
over 20 years ago do you know when it
 
02:17:30.629 --> 02:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
got implemented last year
 
02:17:33.190 --> 02:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
so for over 20 years the departments had
 
02:17:34.709 --> 02:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
the authority to take this very
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
important database put it online
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
they waited over 20 years to actually
 
02:17:41.030 --> 02:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
decide it needed done somehow in new
 
02:17:42.870 --> 02:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire's still standing our citizens
 
02:17:44.709 --> 02:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
are still alive and enjoying a vibrant
 
02:17:47.910 --> 02:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
economy um and and a
 
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
beautiful lifestyle here in new
 
02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:50.709 align:start position:0%
beautiful lifestyle here in new
hampshire

02:17:50.709 --> 02:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to have an effect right so
 
02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
so i i i
 
02:17:56.950 --> 02:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
while i do believe that this database
 
02:17:59.429 --> 02:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
could be important um in in working with
 
02:18:01.110 --> 02:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
public health and understanding disease
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
control um i also recognize that it's
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
maybe not quite as critical as people
 
02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
are making it out to be
 
02:18:10.709 --> 02:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
one thing i'd again i serve on job cars
 
02:18:12.309 --> 02:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
you know so i get to see the rules that
 
02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
come before the jail car relative to
 
02:18:15.990 --> 02:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
certain actions within the agency so
 
02:18:17.669 --> 02:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
dhhs is one of those agencies that comes
 
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis and brings rules
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
and so one of the reasons why i'm
 
02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill is one of the things
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
that concerned me when i saw the rules
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
around the registry
 
02:18:28.629 --> 02:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
was who has access to the registry who
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
has access to enter data who has access
 
02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
to read data and you would think it's
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
the department right some doctors put
 
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
the data in when someone gets vaccinated
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
and the doc and the department gets to
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
look at that and use that for public
 
02:18:41.110 --> 02:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
health policy
 
02:18:42.629 --> 02:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a little bit bigger than
 
02:18:42.639 --> 02:18:43.589 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a little bit bigger than
that

02:18:43.589 --> 02:18:43.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:46.389 --> 02:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
so authorized user means any entity a
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
person which is authorized to enter
 
02:18:50.629 --> 02:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
information into or access certain
 
02:18:52.150 --> 02:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
information contained in the registry
 
02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:53.429 align:start position:0%
information contained in the registry
including

02:18:53.429 --> 02:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
including
 
02:18:55.110 --> 02:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
administering current and former health
 
02:18:57.270 --> 02:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
care providers makes sense health care
 
02:18:59.830 --> 02:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
providers not sure why that's duplicated
 
02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:01.349 align:start position:0%
providers not sure why that's duplicated
schools

02:19:01.349 --> 02:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:19:03.750 --> 02:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
licensed child care agencies
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
and then departments uh department's
 
02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
department's division of public health
 
02:19:10.950 --> 02:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
services and agencies so this isn't just
 
02:19:12.709 --> 02:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
the department we're giving access to
 
02:19:14.150 --> 02:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
child care centers we're bringing access
 
02:19:15.750 --> 02:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
to schools to this database for your
 
02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:20.629 --> 02:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure you even knew about it
 
02:19:23.190 --> 02:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
i i asked the question you know on we
 
02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
talked about getting vaccinated and
 
02:19:25.830 --> 02:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
probably the last vaccination everybody
 
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
went and got was their booster shot if
 
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
they went and chose to get it
 
02:19:30.549 --> 02:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
can you tell me the doctor told you
 
02:19:31.990 --> 02:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
specifically that you could opt out of
 
02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
the registry for that booster shot
 
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's now going to be reported did he
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
actually make an explicit statement to
 
02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
you that oh by the way
 
02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know this this is going to be
 
02:19:41.589 --> 02:19:41.599 align:start position:0%
reported to the state unless you tell me
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
not to report it to the state which
 
02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
really should be the standard
 
02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
that's not what they said right that's
 
02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
not what i i recall on any of these
 
02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinations they don't tell you
 
02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
somewhere buried in the millions of
 
02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
pieces of paper that i think is almost
 
02:19:55.590 --> 02:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
as difficult as buying a car
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
um is one of these acknowledgments that
 
02:19:59.590 --> 02:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
you sign that says oh by the way
 
02:20:01.110 --> 02:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
that you probably never read because in
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
point six font that at my age i can't
 
02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
read anymore anyway
 
02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
um but the other information i found
 
02:20:09.190 --> 02:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
amazing is that
 
02:20:11.429 --> 02:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
most of you think that the the intent of
 
02:20:13.510 --> 02:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
this is to record all vaccinations right
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
because you want to record lot number
 
02:20:16.150 --> 02:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
and all this other kind of stuff the
 
02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
idea was originally it was to serve
 
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
public health but now we're talking
 
02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
about it's going to be your central
 
02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
repository for all vaccinations so if
 
02:20:24.469 --> 02:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
you need to know what you had for
 
02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines you can go to the state and ask
 
02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:27.030 align:start position:0%
vaccines you can go to the state and ask
them

02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:20:29.349 --> 02:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
however there's more to it than that
 
02:20:31.590 --> 02:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
so under the rules the things that are
 
02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
entered into the information into there
 
02:20:33.760 --> 02:20:34.710 align:start position:0%
entered into the information into there
is

02:20:34.710 --> 02:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
a vaccination event is what's recorded
 
02:20:44.710 --> 02:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
in the registry a vaccination event
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
means an immunization an immunoglobulin
 
02:20:50.550 --> 02:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
administration exemption
 
02:20:53.510 --> 02:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
or refusal defined in section p above
 
02:20:55.990 --> 02:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
refusal means
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
and means the act of not receiving a
 
02:21:00.469 --> 02:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
vaccination on a particular day or at a
 
02:21:02.469 --> 02:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
particular medical appointment for such
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
reasons as wanting to delay the
 
02:21:06.550 --> 02:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
vaccination to another time not wanting
 
02:21:08.790 --> 02:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
the particular vaccination at that time
 
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
behavioral or medical issues at the time
 
02:21:12.309 --> 02:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
of vaccination or the religious
 
02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
exemption from a particular vaccination
 
02:21:17.030 --> 02:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
so what that means is every time you go
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
to your doctor whether you get the ex
 
02:21:21.190 --> 02:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
you choose to accept the vaccine or you
 
02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
choose to refuse the vaccine the state's
 
02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
getting the data so it's no longer about
 
02:21:26.710 --> 02:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
who's vaccinated and what the population
 
02:21:28.309 --> 02:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
looks like it's about also who's not
 
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and keeping that data i'm not
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
sure that was the intent originally of
 
02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
the bill is that even if you refuse and
 
02:21:36.870 --> 02:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
you say no i don't want a vaccine the
 
02:21:38.550 --> 02:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
state's still going to collect your data
 
02:21:40.469 --> 02:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
in in what i consider a violation of
 
02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
article 2 part 1 article 2b of our
 
02:21:44.790 --> 02:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
constitution because we didn't ask you
 
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
for the data we're just doing it
 
02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:48.389 align:start position:0%
for the data we're just doing it
so

02:21:48.389 --> 02:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:50.950 --> 02:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
i guess that's the summation of of
 
02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
my uh
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
my comments i again i'm not against the
 
02:21:56.550 --> 02:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
database i just think our citizens need
 
02:21:58.550 --> 02:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
to be informed our citizens should be
 
02:22:01.349 --> 02:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
have you should ask explicit rights to
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
take their data and put it into a state
 
02:22:04.630 --> 02:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
database especially considering the
 
02:22:06.870 --> 02:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
broad access that's given across the
 
02:22:09.510 --> 02:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
state to people outside the health care
 
02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:10.790 align:start position:0%
state to people outside the health care
industry

02:22:10.790 --> 02:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
industry
 
02:22:12.550 --> 02:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
that this data should you should
 
02:22:14.950 --> 02:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
specifically ask and specifically get
 
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
permission to enter the data and i'm
 
02:22:19.030 --> 02:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
asking you please vote otp on this bill
 
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
which does just that it requires health
 
02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
care providers to explicitly ask the
 
02:22:25.510 --> 02:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
citizen for their permission before the
 
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
state collects their data
 
02:22:30.150 --> 02:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
any questions for the representative
 
02:22:36.230 --> 02:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question i
 
02:22:41.910 --> 02:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
actually have two of them but they're
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
very simple
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
first of all where which article is it
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
in the constitution now because i don't
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
part 1 article 2b
 
02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
right to privacy
 
02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:22:56.309 --> 02:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
and then um if you now
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
i've gone to see my
 
02:23:00.550 --> 02:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
my pcp fairly recently
 
02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
and i wasn't really
 
02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
he never said do you want a vaccination
 
02:23:06.389 --> 02:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
have you had one or there were no
 
02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
questions about any kind of vaccination
 
02:23:11.349 --> 02:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
is that recorded as a as a refusal do
 
02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
you know or is that just ignored or how
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
how does that go i honestly don't know
 
02:23:18.389 --> 02:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
it's not defined anywhere huh okay thank
 
02:23:18.399 --> 02:23:19.349 align:start position:0%
it's not defined anywhere huh okay thank
you

02:23:19.349 --> 02:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:23:21.670 --> 02:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative salloway
 
02:23:23.590 --> 02:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman representative
 
02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
lane nice to see you
 
02:23:27.190 --> 02:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
um i noticed that the bill is
 
02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored by
 
02:23:32.630 --> 02:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
people who are identified as s-e-n
 
02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
period i believe that indicates another
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
chamber of the legislature which i have
 
02:23:40.790 --> 02:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
heard rumors exist
 
02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
do you
 
02:23:45.510 --> 02:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
happen to know if another bill from that
 
02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:46.469 align:start position:0%
happen to know if another bill from that
chamber

02:23:46.469 --> 02:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
chamber
 
02:23:49.990 --> 02:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
is likely to show up here on crossover
 
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
i do not know the answer to that i do
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
know there was some concern about this
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
opt-in opt-out provision and i know that
 
02:23:57.429 --> 02:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
again i have a couple senators on this
 
02:23:58.630 --> 02:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
bill they may have taken it upon
 
02:23:59.910 --> 02:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
themselves to add it over there i don't
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
recall one way or another a quick
 
02:24:04.389 --> 02:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
follow-up quick follow-up uh
 
02:24:08.309 --> 02:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
do you happen to know the path of data
 
02:24:08.319 --> 02:24:09.110 align:start position:0%
do you happen to know the path of data
of

02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
of immunization data if i get my
 
02:24:14.950 --> 02:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
immunization at my local cvs
 
02:24:18.070 --> 02:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
where that data then goes and whether or
 
02:24:20.309 --> 02:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
not it comes back to the state
 
02:24:22.309 --> 02:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question so i think
 
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
we've all heard
 
02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:24.550 align:start position:0%
we've all heard
through

02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:24:26.550 --> 02:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
through the numerous
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
media agencies that there's a conflict
 
02:24:30.309 --> 02:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
between the state data and the federal
 
02:24:32.469 --> 02:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
data because some of the larger chains
 
02:24:33.990 --> 02:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
don't even provide the information to
 
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
the state they send it straight to the
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
federal government um and then the state
 
02:24:38.550 --> 02:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
tries to figure out how to reconcile
 
02:24:39.990 --> 02:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
that and as a data guy would never want
 
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
to do that um but um because you're
 
02:24:44.309 --> 02:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
gonna end up with garbage in garbage out
 
02:24:47.590 --> 02:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
um and so uh but we do know that even
 
02:24:50.150 --> 02:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
the iis the immunization i feel what it
 
02:24:52.150 --> 02:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
stands for database um
 
02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
is not accurate right so there are
 
02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
citizens in new hampshire that have
 
02:24:56.870 --> 02:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
gotten the vaccination they're not
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
reported in there at all it's probably
 
02:25:00.070 --> 02:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
refusals that are also not reported at
 
02:25:01.110 --> 02:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
all because
 
02:25:02.230 --> 02:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
again if you
 
02:25:04.389 --> 02:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
you know this goes to my point about cvs
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
by state law they require they should be
 
02:25:07.590 --> 02:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
asking or telling people that they can
 
02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
opt out but i think if you look for that
 
02:25:11.349 --> 02:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
it's in again
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
you know six point font on the back of
 
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
some form that you're signing that may
 
02:25:16.870 --> 02:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
may tell you or they may not even tell
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
you at all and again this would require
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
them to have the pharmacist
 
02:25:22.150 --> 02:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
administering or the provider
 
02:25:23.590 --> 02:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
administrating the
 
02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine to let you know that that data
 
02:25:27.910 --> 02:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's required
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also
 
02:25:36.830 --> 02:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you representative
 
02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
lang a fierce
 
02:25:41.190 --> 02:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
defender of private rights and i totally
 
02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
support it
 
02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
however when i go to the motor vehicle
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
department i don't have the ability to
 
02:25:48.309 --> 02:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
opt out of what information i want to
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
give to the point of vehicle department
 
02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
so therefore a lot of the data the motor
 
02:25:53.910 --> 02:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle department has on my behalf i
 
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
would like to probably strip out but i
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
authority to do that
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
second when it comes to
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
the issue of information which we
 
02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
fiercely guard
 
02:26:05.270 --> 02:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
are you aware of the fact that there's a
 
02:26:07.429 --> 02:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
parallel database
 
02:26:09.510 --> 02:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
and why it brings people's attention it
 
02:26:11.349 --> 02:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
came to my attention one time when i was
 
02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
into a physician's office
 
02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:15.349 align:start position:0%
into a physician's office
and

02:26:15.349 --> 02:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:17.510 --> 02:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
they came up with a whole record of
 
02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
is mostly for my wife
 
02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
on all the medications she's on
 
02:26:22.870 --> 02:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
so i said it's interesting
 
02:26:25.590 --> 02:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
how did you get the information oh
 
02:26:27.990 --> 02:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
the pharmacies sell it to the people who
 
02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
then sell it to us and therefore we have
 
02:26:31.830 --> 02:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
a record of all your medications
 
02:26:33.349 --> 02:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
so therefore the access to all the
 
02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
information we're trying to protect
 
02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
is not being protected
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
so even though it's not in the
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
government side it's in the
 
02:26:41.349 --> 02:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
non-commercial side
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
are you aware of that
 
02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
so as someone who's worked with hl7
 
02:26:47.270 --> 02:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
interfaces before in medical offices i
 
02:26:49.429 --> 02:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
am aware that data is sold a lot of
 
02:26:50.790 --> 02:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
times there's anonymized data and
 
02:26:53.429 --> 02:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not um and it's actually
 
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
the sale of that data is kind of
 
02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
important right so we know that it's
 
02:26:58.389 --> 02:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
used in you know i use diabetes as my as
 
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
my example because it was one of the
 
02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
things i worked on was again working
 
02:27:03.910 --> 02:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
with an interface to build extract data
 
02:27:05.429 --> 02:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
from an electronic medical record system
 
02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide it to
 
02:27:08.790 --> 02:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
some clinicians to be able to do you
 
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
know what what's it look like so so we
 
02:27:12.550 --> 02:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
know this happens um
 
02:27:14.469 --> 02:27:14.479 align:start position:0%
you know if you want to sponsor a bill
 
02:27:15.910 --> 02:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
next year i'll be happy to co-sponsor
 
02:27:16.950 --> 02:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
with you and help you with how we
 
02:27:21.510 --> 02:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
now that pandora's box is opening
 
02:27:31.110 --> 02:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me would you would you think it
 
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
was a good idea that whenever we are
 
02:27:35.429 --> 02:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
offered a vaccine
 
02:27:37.270 --> 02:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
that we get a sheet
 
02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
of paper or something that we sign and
 
02:27:41.429 --> 02:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
we have a receipt
 
02:27:41.439 --> 02:27:42.230 align:start position:0%
we have a receipt
uh

02:27:42.230 --> 02:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:44.990 --> 02:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
that would actually actually we're
 
02:27:47.270 --> 02:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that we
 
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
know you know we're opting in or
 
02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:27:54.790 --> 02:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sorry um
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
to be awkward
 
02:28:00.790 --> 02:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
it became apparent that most people who
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
received vaccines in the past couple
 
02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
years were not apprised of anything
 
02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
they didn't have any kind of proof they
 
02:28:12.150 --> 02:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
had no
 
02:28:14.630 --> 02:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
no acknowledgement that there were risks
 
02:28:17.349 --> 02:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
involved and all vaccines have risks
 
02:28:19.349 --> 02:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
involved whether they're very relatively
 
02:28:21.510 --> 02:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
safe or dangerous
 
02:28:24.389 --> 02:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
but it sounded like nobody got anything
 
02:28:25.510 --> 02:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
02:28:26.790 --> 02:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
are you
 
02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:28.070 align:start position:0%
are you
envisioning

02:28:28.070 --> 02:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
envisioning
 
02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
requiring people to be notified or
 
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
signing off
 
02:28:35.429 --> 02:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
for the opt-in method so thank you for
 
02:28:36.710 --> 02:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
your question and while i'm not going to
 
02:28:38.710 --> 02:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
speak to informed consent which i think
 
02:28:41.190 --> 02:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
our doctors do a fairly good job of in
 
02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
in informing us about the dangers of
 
02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
what we're doing i will say that if you
 
02:28:46.469 --> 02:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
read the bill again in the last sentence
 
02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill no person's personal data
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
such as name address date of birth
 
02:28:51.349 --> 02:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
immunization or vaccination information
 
02:28:52.870 --> 02:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
shall be entered into the registry
 
02:28:54.469 --> 02:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
without explicit
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
written opt-in consent
 
02:28:59.429 --> 02:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
so it's very clear that you have to have
 
02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
a sp you know a very clear understanding
 
02:29:04.230 --> 02:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
and not just something in 6.6 font at
 
02:29:05.510 --> 02:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
the back of a page that you never have
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
to read an initial
 
02:29:10.530 --> 02:29:10.540 align:start position:0%
representative cannon
 
02:29:10.540 --> 02:29:11.990 align:start position:0%

[Music]

02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:29:13.990 --> 02:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you thank
 
02:29:16.389 --> 02:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
you mr chair for recognizing me thank
 
02:29:18.550 --> 02:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative for
 
02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
hearing my question
 
02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
um i'm not i'm not sure of how a
 
02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:26.870 align:start position:0%
um i'm not i'm not sure of how a
a

02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:29:30.630 --> 02:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
a recipient of a vaccine is contacted
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
in case there's a problem with the
 
02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine they received is that
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
from registry information or is it
 
02:29:39.349 --> 02:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
completely separate so thank you for
 
02:29:40.950 --> 02:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
your question so again
 
02:29:43.990 --> 02:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
um every healthcare provider who who
 
02:29:45.750 --> 02:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
acts who gives you an immunization and
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
gives you a vaccination is required to
 
02:29:48.950 --> 02:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
keep a record of that and they have to
 
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
keep all the import pertinent data what
 
02:29:52.309 --> 02:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
your lot number was of the vaccine you
 
02:29:54.150 --> 02:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
got all of that registered and required
 
02:29:56.710 --> 02:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
data is required so if there is an issue
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
with that your provider can notify you
 
02:30:00.070 --> 02:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
of those information so if they get
 
02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
notified by the manufacturer hey this
 
02:30:03.270 --> 02:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
these five lot numbers have problems
 
02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
please contact everybody in your who you
 
02:30:08.070 --> 02:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
gave that lot number two it's the
 
02:30:09.190 --> 02:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
obligation of the provider then to
 
02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
contact you
 
02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:12.469 align:start position:0%

follow-up

02:30:12.469 --> 02:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
um what if i got a vex
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
a vex scene from the state programs and
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
not my provider so that's an interesting
 
02:30:23.270 --> 02:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
statement again so they're governed by
 
02:30:25.270 --> 02:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
the same rules right so they also must
 
02:30:27.990 --> 02:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
keep track of your
 
02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
lot number and information they would
 
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
have the same obligation their providers
 
02:30:32.550 --> 02:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
just by definition like all the other
 
02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
providers in the state
 
02:30:38.950 --> 02:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:42.230 --> 02:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:43.990 --> 02:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative lang for taking this
 
02:30:47.429 --> 02:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
question it's a real simple one i've
 
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
seen other bills come through and they
 
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
have like some type of document that
 
02:30:53.349 --> 02:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
goes along with it would you
 
02:30:55.590 --> 02:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
would you see the need for
 
02:30:58.309 --> 02:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
providing that type of document that
 
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
everybo every provider could use as a as
 
02:31:03.110 --> 02:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
a template
 
02:31:03.750 --> 02:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:31:05.510 --> 02:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative king again i i'd be okay
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
with that um again with a lot of the
 
02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
times i serve it like i said i serve on
 
02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
jail card and a lot of those forms come
 
02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
through car as part of the rule making
 
02:31:13.510 --> 02:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
process once the laws passed and
 
02:31:15.030 --> 02:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
the department makes the appropriate
 
02:31:17.110 --> 02:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
forms unnecessary
 
02:31:20.630 --> 02:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
the department does have an opt out form
 
02:31:22.710 --> 02:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
that if you after the fact decide oh i
 
02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
want my name out of the database you can
 
02:31:27.750 --> 02:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
use a form that go to the go to dhhs get
 
02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
the form and they have a process for
 
02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
doing that um i will say it's not easy
 
02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
to find if you want to do that
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
02:31:39.429 --> 02:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
it's a follow-up thank you mr chair and
 
02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
also thank you for taking the question
 
02:31:42.870 --> 02:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's a follow-up to episode of king's
 
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
comment um i did find the form and i do
 
02:31:48.070 --> 02:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
totally agree it's not easy to find but
 
02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
it does exist
 
02:31:50.710 --> 02:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
and i think one of the concerns i'm
 
02:31:52.389 --> 02:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
hearing is the fact that patients aren't
 
02:31:53.590 --> 02:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
aware of it
 
02:31:55.830 --> 02:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
so therefore if we were able to allow
 
02:31:57.270 --> 02:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
the patient because one of the things
 
02:31:59.030 --> 02:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
you are required to do
 
02:32:01.110 --> 02:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
when you give a vaccine
 
02:32:03.270 --> 02:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
is provide the patient what they call a
 
02:32:05.429 --> 02:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
vaccine information sheet required by
 
02:32:07.030 --> 02:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
at the time in which that's provided to
 
02:32:11.750 --> 02:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
the patient if the form of how they can
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
get into the database and there's a link
 
02:32:15.830 --> 02:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
on the database to opt out of it
 
02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
would that not
 
02:32:18.550 --> 02:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
go in the right direction at that point
 
02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
in time or providing them both the form
 
02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
a link to the form so they could easily
 
02:32:26.710 --> 02:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
opt out when they wanted to
 
02:32:28.150 --> 02:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
to make it easier for the patient at
 
02:32:29.830 --> 02:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
that point in time versus them having to
 
02:32:32.230 --> 02:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
go down and try to find it
 
02:32:33.670 --> 02:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative merchant for
 
02:32:35.270 --> 02:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
the question and again
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
i'm a guy who wants to get stuff done so
 
02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
if that's the only way it's going to
 
02:32:39.349 --> 02:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
pass out of this committee i'd accept
 
02:32:42.389 --> 02:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
that he said but the reality is that
 
02:32:44.070 --> 02:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
again we're making
 
02:32:45.910 --> 02:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
work right so we're making work the
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
person could choose to opt out right in
 
02:32:48.230 --> 02:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
the beginning and then there's no work
 
02:32:50.309 --> 02:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
for the state agency to delete anything
 
02:32:52.230 --> 02:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
that we could take it right up front and
 
02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
and provide that same form and on that
 
02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
same thing as do you want your data
 
02:32:56.950 --> 02:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
entered into the database and then it
 
02:32:58.389 --> 02:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
never creates the work for the state
 
02:32:58.399 --> 02:32:59.429 align:start position:0%
never creates the work for the state
agency

02:32:59.429 --> 02:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
agency
 
02:33:02.150 --> 02:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
on the back side right so i'd rather opt
 
02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
for reducing the amount of work than
 
02:33:05.990 --> 02:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
increasing the amount of work
 
02:33:07.670 --> 02:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative canarch
 
02:33:09.510 --> 02:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
yes i agree with that it make makes a
 
02:33:10.870 --> 02:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
lot more sense not to get in there to
 
02:33:11.990 --> 02:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
start with if that's what the person
 
02:33:13.590 --> 02:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
wants but what i am concerned is the
 
02:33:16.389 --> 02:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
implication you mentioned about the opt
 
02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
out you know being kind of lost uh on
 
02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
the forums in a very small font and i
 
02:33:20.960 --> 02:33:21.750 align:start position:0%
the forums in a very small font and i
think

02:33:21.750 --> 02:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
i think what representative king was
 
02:33:25.030 --> 02:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
driving at is the same thing can occur
 
02:33:26.870 --> 02:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
down the other side as well on an opt-in
 
02:33:28.389 --> 02:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
form and it's certainly important for
 
02:33:30.870 --> 02:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
people to understand the loss of
 
02:33:33.110 --> 02:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh quality of information and tracking i
 
02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
mean a lot of us get a vaccination in
 
02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
the doc's office and often the pharmacy
 
02:33:38.710 --> 02:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
and and i can't remember where what i
 
02:33:41.190 --> 02:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
got when um and and you know this is a
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
way to be able to get it and so would
 
02:33:45.190 --> 02:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
you agree that we have well first of all
 
02:33:46.870 --> 02:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
that we have to get the enough
 
02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
information of the person to understand
 
02:33:50.630 --> 02:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
the implications of not entering into it
 
02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of ease of tracking data for
 
02:33:54.309 --> 02:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
themselves as well
 
02:33:56.309 --> 02:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't it work just as well if
 
02:33:58.790 --> 02:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
rather than worry about making it opt
 
02:34:01.030 --> 02:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
out with a large form that makes it
 
02:34:02.710 --> 02:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
clear and separate not just on the back
 
02:34:04.630 --> 02:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
page if we did the same thing for the
 
02:34:07.190 --> 02:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
opt-in but again prevent it from
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
right up front not saying here's how you
 
02:34:10.070 --> 02:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
can opt out after we got your data but
 
02:34:12.550 --> 02:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
instead you can opt out right now if you
 
02:34:14.710 --> 02:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
wish to do so but not in the back of a
 
02:34:17.429 --> 02:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
page not point six font would that be an
 
02:34:19.270 --> 02:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
acceptable option so again i think
 
02:34:20.309 --> 02:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
you're just doing the inverse of the
 
02:34:21.830 --> 02:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
same question right it's basically a
 
02:34:23.030 --> 02:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
checkbox so i want to opt in do i want
 
02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
to opt out what i want to do check the
 
02:34:27.110 --> 02:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
box accordingly right so again
 
02:34:29.510 --> 02:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh that's a fine option again as long as
 
02:34:31.270 --> 02:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's required and clear that a decision
 
02:34:32.469 --> 02:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
has to be made by the patient right
 
02:34:34.389 --> 02:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm i'm most concerned with
 
02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
is that the new hampshire citizen
 
02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:38.479 align:start position:0%
makes an informed and intelligent
 
02:34:40.389 --> 02:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
decision right they check that box say
 
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
yes i want the state to take my data no
 
02:34:43.590 --> 02:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
i don't want the state to take my data
 
02:34:44.950 --> 02:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
and not just have the state take it by
 
02:34:47.429 --> 02:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
default because they're not informed
 
02:34:49.750 --> 02:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative canarch yes so
 
02:34:50.710 --> 02:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
i think we're kind of getting to
 
02:34:52.230 --> 02:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
something here that might be interesting
 
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
so we wouldn't have an opt-in we
 
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have an opt-out we just simply
 
02:34:56.950 --> 02:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
haven't opt
 
02:34:58.630 --> 02:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
you know they would have two boxes they
 
02:35:00.389 --> 02:35:00.399 align:start position:0%
would have to therefore
 
02:35:02.870 --> 02:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
make a move to either opt in or to opt
 
02:35:04.389 --> 02:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
out but they'd have enough information
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
to understand the
 
02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
the benefits and the downsides of making
 
02:35:12.150 --> 02:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
either decision but that one form would
 
02:35:13.590 --> 02:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
have to be filled up by everybody and
 
02:35:14.790 --> 02:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
they would therefore be forced to
 
02:35:16.389 --> 02:35:16.399 align:start position:0%
actually truly make a decision at the
 
02:35:16.399 --> 02:35:17.349 align:start position:0%
actually truly make a decision at the
time

02:35:17.349 --> 02:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
would would you be comfortable with that
 
02:35:20.870 --> 02:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
because that that kind of is
 
02:35:22.790 --> 02:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
not an opt-in opt-out it's an opt i
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
would absolutely and i think that would
 
02:35:25.830 --> 02:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
go to the intent of the original law
 
02:35:27.429 --> 02:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
which which was there
 
02:35:29.429 --> 02:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
and again i i would caveat it with one
 
02:35:32.790 --> 02:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
thing no form means no data
 
02:35:34.630 --> 02:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
yes if you don't submit the form the
 
02:35:37.030 --> 02:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
data doesn't get submitted either
 
02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:40.230 align:start position:0%
data doesn't get submitted either
fair

02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:43.270 --> 02:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative acton thank you mr chair
 
02:35:46.710 --> 02:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:49.830 --> 02:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
just in general from taking a a larger
 
02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
overview of this situation uh
 
02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
is it a valid concern of mine that we
 
02:35:56.469 --> 02:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
tend we seem to be
 
02:35:59.510 --> 02:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
moving away from the responsibility to
 
02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:01.270 align:start position:0%
moving away from the responsibility to
convince

02:36:01.270 --> 02:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
convince
 
02:36:02.710 --> 02:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
patients through education and
 
02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:04.469 align:start position:0%
patients through education and
communication

02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
communication
 
02:36:06.469 --> 02:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
to take part in
 
02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
um opting uh providing information we're
 
02:36:10.950 --> 02:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
moving to
 
02:36:12.630 --> 02:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
more of a compel
 
02:36:15.190 --> 02:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
situation where in this case
 
02:36:16.710 --> 02:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
we do have the right to opt out but i
 
02:36:18.870 --> 02:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
was i was never told when i didn't even
 
02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:19.670 align:start position:0%
was i was never told when i didn't even
know

02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:36:19.680 --> 02:36:20.550 align:start position:0%
know
um

02:36:20.550 --> 02:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:22.389 --> 02:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
is that a valid concern
 
02:36:24.309 --> 02:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely and again it's the basis for
 
02:36:26.070 --> 02:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
my bill right is that is that we're
 
02:36:28.389 --> 02:36:28.399 align:start position:0%
moving we're collecting data not asking
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
we're compelling basically for lack of a
 
02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
better phrase because if you don't tell
 
02:36:32.469 --> 02:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
them you can't do it then they don't
 
02:36:33.590 --> 02:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
know they can't do it they're just going
 
02:36:35.910 --> 02:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
to do it and so i absolutely agree we're
 
02:36:37.270 --> 02:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
moving to where we're compelling
 
02:36:39.030 --> 02:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
citizens and i i did want to add one
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
comment there are there are some someone
 
02:36:42.790 --> 02:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
made a question about driver's licenses
 
02:36:44.710 --> 02:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
and there are some data points you can
 
02:36:46.469 --> 02:36:46.479 align:start position:0%
actually exclude some not all but you
 
02:36:47.910 --> 02:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
can say i don't want you to collect this
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
data and you can you can have it removed
 
02:36:51.510 --> 02:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
including your photo
 
02:36:52.870 --> 02:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
um is one of the things you can have
 
02:36:55.270 --> 02:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
removed and so there are points where
 
02:36:56.550 --> 02:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
we've recognized there are certain
 
02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
pieces of data we don't want the
 
02:36:59.190 --> 02:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
government to stay on to so while you
 
02:37:00.309 --> 02:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
might get your driver's license
 
02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
initially you can then um as right there
 
02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
they give you a form you can check the
 
02:37:05.990 --> 02:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
little box they remove my room my photo
 
02:37:09.349 --> 02:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
after i you print my photo my id
 
02:37:11.030 --> 02:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
so yes is the answer to your question i
 
02:37:11.990 --> 02:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
think we're moving to where we're
 
02:37:13.510 --> 02:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
compelling more citizens to do stuff
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
that they don't necessarily know they're
 
02:37:16.710 --> 02:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
even being compelled to do thank you
 
02:37:18.790 --> 02:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
02:37:20.070 --> 02:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:37:21.510 --> 02:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative lang for taking my
 
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
question i'm just uh
 
02:37:25.429 --> 02:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
perusing through the administrative
 
02:37:31.349 --> 02:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
rules here and i see in its hep 307
 
02:37:31.359 --> 02:37:32.870 align:start position:0%
rules here and i see in its hep 307
points

02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
points
 
02:37:34.150 --> 02:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
the content and submission of
 
02:37:37.429 --> 02:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
vaccination event reports
 
02:37:40.630 --> 02:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
in section c of that number one it says
 
02:37:42.309 --> 02:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
that they also have to enter the
 
02:37:45.190 --> 02:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
registrant's insurer information
 
02:37:47.110 --> 02:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
as held by the current health care
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
i mean i i believe that that's probably
 
02:37:55.349 --> 02:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
another point that people would prefer
 
02:37:57.750 --> 02:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
not to have sent to the state
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
um were you aware of that and would you
 
02:38:01.349 --> 02:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
agree i actually did i agree with you
 
02:38:02.950 --> 02:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
100 again
 
02:38:05.190 --> 02:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
it goes to what does it matter
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
um what my who my insurance carrier is
 
02:38:08.309 --> 02:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
but for some reason the state's
 
02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
collecting that data and dumping it into
 
02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
this database to do that
 
02:38:13.270 --> 02:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
i will say again as someone who's worked
 
02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
with data a lot that almost all of this
 
02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
data is available to the state through
 
02:38:18.070 --> 02:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
anonymized data
 
02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
they can go to insurance companies
 
02:38:22.389 --> 02:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
asking whatever the icd-9 code is for in
 
02:38:24.190 --> 02:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
vaccinations say give me a list of
 
02:38:26.389 --> 02:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
non-identifiable data of everybody who
 
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
got a vaccine in the state of new
 
02:38:28.710 --> 02:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire now they can give you that
 
02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:29.510 align:start position:0%
hampshire now they can give you that
data

02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
um so i'm not even sure there's a real
 
02:38:32.950 --> 02:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
need for the database we can create the
 
02:38:34.309 --> 02:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
database just from the insurance
 
02:38:36.150 --> 02:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
carriers alone who are paying for it
 
02:38:37.830 --> 02:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's medicare medicaid or blue
 
02:38:39.670 --> 02:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
cross blue shield or anthem or pick
 
02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:40.710 align:start position:0%
cross blue shield or anthem or pick
somebody

02:38:40.710 --> 02:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
02:38:42.150 --> 02:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
that date is still available to the
 
02:38:43.510 --> 02:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
they don't need to drag it from the
 
02:38:45.910 --> 02:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
citizen they can ask for the
 
02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:53.270 --> 02:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
point of clarification thank you mr
 
02:38:56.790 --> 02:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
chair my understanding the data resides
 
02:38:56.800 --> 02:38:57.510 align:start position:0%
chair my understanding the data resides
in

02:38:57.510 --> 02:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:38:59.270 --> 02:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
department insurance not the department
 
02:39:01.030 --> 02:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
health and human services so therefore
 
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
for the one agency to go to the other
 
02:39:04.230 --> 02:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
agency i'm not quite sure about the
 
02:39:06.309 --> 02:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
interagency play but the database is
 
02:39:07.590 --> 02:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
actually insurance department not health
 
02:39:08.830 --> 02:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:10.550 align:start position:0%
and human services
okay

02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:39:12.309 --> 02:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:39:15.030 --> 02:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative lang for taking the
 
02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:16.150 align:start position:0%
representative lang for taking the
question

02:39:16.150 --> 02:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:39:19.030 --> 02:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
i know that the current database has a a
 
02:39:20.950 --> 02:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
lot of issues it's not as good of data
 
02:39:22.950 --> 02:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
as we would like do you think that
 
02:39:25.110 --> 02:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
pulling the data from the icd-9 codes
 
02:39:26.950 --> 02:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
might actually give us a more accurate
 
02:39:29.429 --> 02:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
count than what we have today
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you question again i think the
 
02:39:33.510 --> 02:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
biggest problem around the data is the
 
02:39:35.429 --> 02:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
fact that we have some providers
 
02:39:37.429 --> 02:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
reporting directly to the cdc and some
 
02:39:39.270 --> 02:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
not reporting to the state and then we
 
02:39:41.190 --> 02:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
end up with conflict of we don't know
 
02:39:43.590 --> 02:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
what the real number is anymore um i i
 
02:39:45.270 --> 02:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
would postulate that our coping our
 
02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
cover vaccination rates are higher than
 
02:39:47.910 --> 02:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
being reported because the state
 
02:39:49.590 --> 02:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
database isn't accurate
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
and that the feds are probably closer
 
02:39:52.870 --> 02:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
but again i don't even know if the fed's
 
02:39:54.389 --> 02:39:54.399 align:start position:0%
got all the data so i would just
 
02:39:55.830 --> 02:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
postulate that the number's probably
 
02:39:57.510 --> 02:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
higher on our vaccination rates and
 
02:40:02.389 --> 02:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:04.550 --> 02:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you mr
 
02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:10.640 align:start position:0%

representing all our hospitals

1606 um as stated this bill was um heard
 
02:41:09.030 --> 02:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh very this committee excuse me heard a
 
02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
very similar bill house bill 221 last
 
02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:12.309 align:start position:0%
very similar bill house bill 221 last
year

02:41:12.309 --> 02:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:41:14.070 --> 02:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
that tried to change the immunization
 
02:41:16.550 --> 02:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
registry to an opt-in and the majority
 
02:41:18.230 --> 02:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
of the committee members at that time
 
02:41:20.309 --> 02:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
voted inexpedient to legislate due to
 
02:41:22.309 --> 02:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
the constraints during one of the house
 
02:41:24.870 --> 02:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
sessions back in the spring of 21. the
 
02:41:27.269 --> 02:41:27.279 align:start position:0%
bill was ultimately not voted on hence
 
02:41:29.830 --> 02:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
why we are here today
 
02:41:31.750 --> 02:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
this bill does change the current
 
02:41:33.510 --> 02:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
process for submitting information to
 
02:41:35.349 --> 02:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
the state vaccine registry from an
 
02:41:37.269 --> 02:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
opt-out to an opt-in
 
02:41:39.750 --> 02:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
we have concerns that the opt-in process
 
02:41:41.269 --> 02:41:41.279 align:start position:0%
would be cumbersome for both the
 
02:41:43.750 --> 02:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
individual and the health care provider
 
02:41:45.670 --> 02:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
creating barriers to producing a
 
02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive immunization record for
 
02:41:49.830 --> 02:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
individuals and impede sound clinical
 
02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
decision making if health care providers
 
02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
cannot rely on complete information
 
02:41:56.469 --> 02:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
for their members and
 
02:41:58.469 --> 02:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
the purposes of the vaccine registry i
 
02:42:00.469 --> 02:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
won't list all of this but it is the
 
02:42:02.790 --> 02:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
immunization information system you also
 
02:42:04.870 --> 02:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
hear it as iis but that's what it stands
 
02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
for it is multi-fold and um i am
 
02:42:10.630 --> 02:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
actually going to let the department
 
02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
talk about more specifics i am
 
02:42:14.469 --> 02:42:14.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely not an expert on this but i
 
02:42:17.670 --> 02:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
know there are experts here that
 
02:42:21.110 --> 02:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
can answer specific questions but it um
 
02:42:22.870 --> 02:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
some of the purposes of the vaccine
 
02:42:25.030 --> 02:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
registry is to have one location where
 
02:42:27.349 --> 02:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
vaccines are administered at multiple
 
02:42:27.359 --> 02:42:28.950 align:start position:0%
vaccines are administered at multiple
locations

02:42:28.950 --> 02:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
locations
 
02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
allow for vaccine ordering tracking and
 
02:42:33.110 --> 02:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
administration history
 
02:42:35.110 --> 02:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
and minimize waste of vaccines through
 
02:42:38.550 --> 02:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
proper inventory management etc
 
02:42:41.269 --> 02:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
if the vaccine registry were set up
 
02:42:43.269 --> 02:42:43.279 align:start position:0%
solely as an opt-in system the health
 
02:42:45.110 --> 02:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
care providers would be required to ask
 
02:42:47.750 --> 02:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
every single person every single time a
 
02:42:50.950 --> 02:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine was administered if their data
 
02:42:52.790 --> 02:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
were to be added to the registry and a
 
02:42:54.710 --> 02:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
person could receive vaccinations at
 
02:42:56.790 --> 02:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
many locations as stated earlier
 
02:42:58.469 --> 02:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
physician offices pharmacies
 
02:42:59.990 --> 02:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
school-based clinics
 
02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
community vaccination sites hospitals
 
02:43:03.750 --> 02:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities urgent care
 
02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
centers etc the time and paperwork
 
02:43:09.429 --> 02:43:09.439 align:start position:0%
needed to document and opt in at every
 
02:43:10.950 --> 02:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
point of vaccination would be
 
02:43:13.110 --> 02:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
overwhelming for the individual
 
02:43:16.550 --> 02:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:18.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:43:18.230 --> 02:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:18.950 align:start position:0%
okay
a

02:43:18.950 --> 02:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:43:22.389 --> 02:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
check of persons active in opt-in answer
 
02:43:24.469 --> 02:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
would need to be put in place by all
 
02:43:26.870 --> 02:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
health care providers before any data
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
could be shared the current vaccine
 
02:43:31.190 --> 02:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
registry law in new hampshire is set up
 
02:43:33.750 --> 02:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
as an opt out and this structure
 
02:43:35.670 --> 02:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
requires the health care provider to ask
 
02:43:38.469 --> 02:43:38.479 align:start position:0%
a person their preference once document
 
02:43:41.110 --> 02:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
it in the person person's medical record
 
02:43:43.429 --> 02:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
and set up their data submission system
 
02:43:45.750 --> 02:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
to exclude that person if they choose an
 
02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:46.790 align:start position:0%
to exclude that person if they choose an
opt-out

02:43:46.790 --> 02:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
opt-out
 
02:43:49.429 --> 02:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
otherwise vaccine data is transmitted
 
02:43:52.230 --> 02:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
regularly and a systematic and efficient
 
02:43:55.110 --> 02:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
flow of data can be maintained
 
02:43:58.550 --> 02:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
according to a study by the cdc in 2017
 
02:44:01.910 --> 02:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
42 out of 50 states plus washington dc
 
02:44:04.070 --> 02:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
have their immunization registry set up
 
02:44:06.790 --> 02:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
as opt out clearly it is a position that
 
02:44:08.870 --> 02:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
most states that vaccine registry should
 
02:44:11.190 --> 02:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
be established as an opt-out
 
02:44:12.870 --> 02:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
while it is true that
 
02:44:15.429 --> 02:44:15.439 align:start position:0%
that if someone opts out of the registry
 
02:44:16.790 --> 02:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
that person's information will be
 
02:44:19.429 --> 02:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
non-existent in the registry it would be
 
02:44:21.429 --> 02:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon that individual to
 
02:44:23.590 --> 02:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
maintain their own records and share the
 
02:44:25.269 --> 02:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
necessary data with their health care
 
02:44:25.279 --> 02:44:26.309 align:start position:0%
necessary data with their health care
provider

02:44:26.309 --> 02:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
provider
 
02:44:28.950 --> 02:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
the key to any decision about a registry
 
02:44:32.710 --> 02:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
is ult is ultimate utility any database
 
02:44:34.870 --> 02:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
regardless if it's for vaccines medical
 
02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
records vital records and the like must
 
02:44:39.030 --> 02:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
be viewed as an important tool in the
 
02:44:41.030 --> 02:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
toolbox for healthcare providers and
 
02:44:43.590 --> 02:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
individuals alike why choose an opt-in
 
02:44:45.110 --> 02:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
registry that would create an
 
02:44:47.670 --> 02:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
inefficient incomplete system that could
 
02:44:49.830 --> 02:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
not be relied on as a useful tool
 
02:44:52.230 --> 02:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
clinical decisions could be hampered
 
02:44:54.790 --> 02:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
important vaccines missed vaccines could
 
02:44:56.950 --> 02:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
be administered more than once because
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
of the uncertainty of whether there were
 
02:45:01.990 --> 02:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
done due to lack of documentation i have
 
02:45:03.990 --> 02:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
provided some links which i realize
 
02:45:06.150 --> 02:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
don't work on a piece of paper
 
02:45:07.590 --> 02:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
i can
 
02:45:10.230 --> 02:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
send it to you so you can
 
02:45:13.110 --> 02:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
you use those hyperlinks to review some
 
02:45:16.230 --> 02:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
of the information that as background
 
02:45:18.070 --> 02:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
hospital association wants new hampshire
 
02:45:20.070 --> 02:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
to develop a stable reliable and
 
02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
comprehensive vaccine registry that can
 
02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
be used by and for health care providers
 
02:45:26.550 --> 02:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
and individuals
 
02:45:28.309 --> 02:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
our hospitals and health care providers
 
02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
have been advocating for years to have a
 
02:45:32.469 --> 02:45:32.479 align:start position:0%
functioning vaccine registry in our
 
02:45:34.630 --> 02:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
state as a reliable tool in their
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
toolbox we ask that no changes be made
 
02:45:39.990 --> 02:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
to the registry structure before it can
 
02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
truly get off the ground for all these
 
02:45:44.630 --> 02:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
reasons we are opposed to
 
02:45:47.590 --> 02:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
1606 and thank you for the time i also
 
02:45:48.870 --> 02:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
want to point out
 
02:45:50.950 --> 02:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
um my colleague
 
02:45:52.950 --> 02:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
courtney tanner sent you from dartmouth

this morning
 
02:46:04.710 --> 02:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill as well so i just
 
02:46:06.710 --> 02:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to be on the record that you do
 
02:46:08.950 --> 02:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
have that in your email
 
02:46:10.469 --> 02:46:10.479 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions well i'll
 
02:46:12.309 --> 02:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
try to answer questions but i am not an
 
02:46:13.630 --> 02:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
expert on this
 
02:46:19.750 --> 02:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:22.150 --> 02:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you just
 
02:46:24.230 --> 02:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
if you know
 
02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:25.830 align:start position:0%
if you know
i'm

02:46:25.830 --> 02:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:46:28.389 --> 02:46:28.399 align:start position:0%
inquiring about your statements about a
 
02:46:30.389 --> 02:46:30.399 align:start position:0%
person could receive vaccinations at
 
02:46:32.230 --> 02:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
many locations this is one of your
 
02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:33.750 align:start position:0%
many locations this is one of your
objections

02:46:33.750 --> 02:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
objections
 
02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
are not those
 
02:46:38.309 --> 02:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
locations each isn't each location
 
02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
currently required to let the patient
 
02:46:42.870 --> 02:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
know or the patient's parent know if
 
02:46:45.349 --> 02:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
it's a child that they have the option
 
02:46:46.950 --> 02:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
to opt out
 
02:46:49.190 --> 02:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
yes that's my understanding i think
 
02:46:50.950 --> 02:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
what's getting confused and i think this
 
02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:51.750 align:start position:0%
what's getting confused and i think this
was

02:46:51.750 --> 02:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:46:54.550 --> 02:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
discussed during 1608 earlier and i know
 
02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
that was passed in on the
 
02:46:59.429 --> 02:46:59.439 align:start position:0%
docket for this week in the house
 
02:47:02.630 --> 02:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
what happened with the covid vaccine
 
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
is very different than what the normal
 
02:47:09.110 --> 02:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccine process is um and
 
02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
1608 as you know there's now going to if
 
02:47:14.950 --> 02:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
this bill were to become law that will
 
02:47:17.429 --> 02:47:17.439 align:start position:0%
require a notification by the department
 
02:47:19.510 --> 02:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
to notify people that they have an
 
02:47:22.630 --> 02:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
opt-out opportunity covid19 that was
 
02:47:25.349 --> 02:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
just an extraordinary process as you all
 
02:47:25.359 --> 02:47:26.150 align:start position:0%
just an extraordinary process as you all
know

02:47:26.150 --> 02:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:47:27.190 --> 02:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
but yes
 
02:47:30.309 --> 02:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccines etc there is an
 
02:47:32.309 --> 02:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
02:47:35.110 --> 02:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
opt out um and that's what um as i
 
02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
stated that's
 
02:47:39.510 --> 02:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
at wherever it is offered
 
02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:40.469 align:start position:0%
at wherever it is offered
yep

02:47:40.469 --> 02:47:40.479 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:47:43.190 --> 02:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative cushman so could i have
 
02:47:48.070 --> 02:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:51.030 --> 02:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
so as much as i support opt-out rather
 
02:47:52.469 --> 02:47:52.479 align:start position:0%
than opt-in
 
02:47:53.910 --> 02:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
02:47:56.630 --> 02:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
if you could explain how having an
 
02:47:58.550 --> 02:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
opt-in system
 
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
is more onerous than the current opt-out
 
02:48:04.790 --> 02:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
system if the opt-out system were
 
02:48:06.630 --> 02:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
working as the opt-out system is
 
02:48:09.429 --> 02:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
supposed to be working and i need to ask
 
02:48:09.439 --> 02:48:10.309 align:start position:0%
supposed to be working and i need to ask
um

02:48:10.309 --> 02:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:11.830 --> 02:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
to defer to the department because they
 
02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
can explain it better but when you think
 
02:48:17.590 --> 02:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
about it if we have 99 or whatever it is
 
02:48:19.110 --> 02:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
of individuals
 
02:48:22.550 --> 02:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
are currently opting in so the process
 
02:48:25.030 --> 02:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
you do it once you do the opt out once
 
02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:26.070 align:start position:0%
you do it once you do the opt out once
request

02:48:26.070 --> 02:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:26.790 align:start position:0%
request
or

02:48:26.790 --> 02:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:27.750 align:start position:0%
or
discuss

02:48:27.750 --> 02:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
02:48:29.510 --> 02:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
and then if they choose to the
 
02:48:31.910 --> 02:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
individual can opt out if you're going
 
02:48:34.790 --> 02:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
to do the opt-in every single time that
 
02:48:36.870 --> 02:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
is that is really cumbersome so i'm
 
02:48:38.550 --> 02:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
thinking of 99
 
02:48:40.469 --> 02:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
versus the one percent that would want
 
02:48:43.670 --> 02:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
to opt out you know what i'm saying
 
02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
now representative cushman thank you mr
 
02:48:47.750 --> 02:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:49.510 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

02:48:49.510 --> 02:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:48:51.990 --> 02:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
um concerning the
 
02:48:54.230 --> 02:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
the opt-out requirement only once it's
 
02:48:56.830 --> 02:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding that that's in rules
 
02:48:59.030 --> 02:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:49:01.830 --> 02:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
it's not really a true opt-out if you're
 
02:49:04.950 --> 02:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
only alerted one time and not with every
 
02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:07.830 align:start position:0%
only alerted one time and not with every
vaccination

02:49:07.830 --> 02:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:09.910 --> 02:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
years could go by at the same practice
 
02:49:12.070 --> 02:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
where you receive something and then
 
02:49:14.230 --> 02:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
maybe at that time you don't want it so
 
02:49:16.150 --> 02:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
i do think that it needs to be done
 
02:49:18.469 --> 02:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
every time anyway our constitution
 
02:49:20.309 --> 02:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
requires that
 
02:49:20.319 --> 02:49:21.190 align:start position:0%
requires that
um

02:49:21.190 --> 02:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:23.429 --> 02:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
but my question
 
02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
is um what are the processes that the
 
02:49:28.230 --> 02:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
hospital systems have in place i know
 
02:49:30.710 --> 02:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
that you you speak to all the hospitals
 
02:49:33.190 --> 02:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
pretty frequently what are their
 
02:49:35.910 --> 02:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures for ensuring
 
02:49:39.750 --> 02:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
that the opt out information is being
 
02:49:42.230 --> 02:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
given to every patient
 
02:49:44.550 --> 02:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
um it's really more in the physician
 
02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:45.670 align:start position:0%
um it's really more in the physician
offices

02:49:45.670 --> 02:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
offices
 
02:49:47.830 --> 02:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
and they do have processes i don't know
 
02:49:50.230 --> 02:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
specifically what they are but they are
 
02:49:53.750 --> 02:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
aware um and i think it's cl and again
 
02:49:56.870 --> 02:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
the department um can clarify um miss
 
02:49:58.070 --> 02:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
tilly can
 
02:50:01.429 --> 02:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
clarify but there is a next it doesn't
 
02:50:03.830 --> 02:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
explicitly say out opt out in the in the
 
02:50:06.710 --> 02:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
law in 141 but it does talk about the
 
02:50:09.269 --> 02:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
02:50:10.870 --> 02:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
they don't again doesn't use the word
 
02:50:13.110 --> 02:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
opt out but it is in the statute as well
 
02:50:15.910 --> 02:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:18.070 --> 02:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:50:19.590 --> 02:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:50:22.469 --> 02:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
thank you how does the data get into the
 
02:50:24.630 --> 02:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
database how does anybody know that a
 
02:50:27.830 --> 02:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
person got a vaccine and which one it is
 
02:50:27.840 --> 02:50:29.510 align:start position:0%
person got a vaccine and which one it is
etc

02:50:29.510 --> 02:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
etc
 
02:50:32.870 --> 02:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
it is the requirement of the provider to
 
02:50:35.510 --> 02:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
get it into the vaccine so
 
02:50:35.520 --> 02:50:36.550 align:start position:0%
get it into the vaccine so
again

02:50:36.550 --> 02:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:50:38.070 --> 02:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
the mechanics are really the
 
02:50:40.230 --> 02:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
department's responsibility i will defer
 
02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
to them to answer that
 
02:50:45.990 --> 02:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's like logging in to
 
02:50:48.469 --> 02:50:48.479 align:start position:0%
the system so the provider that
 
02:50:50.389 --> 02:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
provides a vaccine
 
02:50:54.710 --> 02:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
does that so the provider must do it yes
 
02:50:56.389 --> 02:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
i think there are pediatricians that
 
02:50:59.750 --> 02:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
might be testifying that can explain it
 
02:51:01.590 --> 02:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
because it's a lot of most of these are
 
02:51:03.190 --> 02:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccines when you think about
 
02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:05.510 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccines when you think about
it

02:51:05.510 --> 02:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:51:06.550 --> 02:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
one more
 
02:51:09.349 --> 02:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
so opting out would mean they don't put
 
02:51:11.670 --> 02:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
the data in they it gets taken out
 
02:51:13.429 --> 02:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
there's a form again how did the
 
02:51:13.439 --> 02:51:15.110 align:start position:0%
there's a form again how did the
department

02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:51:17.190 --> 02:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
if they have to take it out how did it
 
02:51:18.950 --> 02:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
get in
 
02:51:21.110 --> 02:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
i will have the department explain it
 
02:51:23.750 --> 02:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
but if they opt out at a later date then
 
02:51:25.750 --> 02:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
it gets there's a form that then the
 
02:51:25.760 --> 02:51:27.750 align:start position:0%
it gets there's a form that then the
department

02:51:27.750 --> 02:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:51:29.750 --> 02:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
how did it get in to start with when
 
02:51:31.750 --> 02:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
they're giving them the shot and they
 
02:51:33.590 --> 02:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
have to
 
02:51:35.910 --> 02:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you say the provider puts
 
02:51:37.190 --> 02:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
it in
 
02:51:39.590 --> 02:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay so we're not talking about later
 
02:51:41.269 --> 02:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about right then if they
 
02:51:43.590 --> 02:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
opted out right then
 
02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
then maybe it's in there i am not sure
 
02:51:48.389 --> 02:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
again the mechanics because i don't work
 
02:51:50.870 --> 02:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
in a physician's office i will defer to
 
02:51:52.870 --> 02:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
the department or to a pedia
 
02:51:55.429 --> 02:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
pediatrician's office to try to explain
 
02:51:57.269 --> 02:51:57.279 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more clearly than i
 
02:51:57.279 --> 02:51:58.469 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more clearly than i
can

02:51:58.469 --> 02:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:52:00.230 --> 02:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you miss minihan the chair now

02:52:04.950 --> 02:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
mccurry who might be able to answer some
 
02:52:08.230 --> 02:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
of these questions that uh
 
02:52:21.750 --> 02:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:23.269 --> 02:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you my name is
 
02:52:25.030 --> 02:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
patricia tilly i'm the director of the
 
02:52:26.710 --> 02:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
division of public health services at
 
02:52:28.150 --> 02:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of health
 
02:52:30.389 --> 02:52:30.399 align:start position:0%
and human services thank you chair thank
 
02:52:32.150 --> 02:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
you committee for hearing our testimony
 
02:52:34.710 --> 02:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
today the department is here today to
 
02:52:36.830 --> 02:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose hb
 
02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:38.550 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose hb
1606

02:52:38.550 --> 02:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
1606
 
02:52:40.790 --> 02:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
as you have heard throughout the session
 
02:52:42.389 --> 02:52:42.399 align:start position:0%
immunization is considered one of the
 
02:52:43.830 --> 02:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
most important public health
 
02:52:45.830 --> 02:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
achievements of the last century
 
02:52:47.990 --> 02:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
immunizations are a safe
 
02:52:50.630 --> 02:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
effective way to protect your children
 
02:52:53.429 --> 02:52:53.439 align:start position:0%
and adults from disease including some
 
02:52:55.349 --> 02:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
cancers as we've heard about the impact
 
02:52:58.550 --> 02:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
of cancer earlier this morning
 
02:52:59.910 --> 02:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
it helps
 
02:53:02.550 --> 02:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
are because of childhood vaccines we no
 
02:53:05.670 --> 02:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
longer lose our children to diseases
 
02:53:09.349 --> 02:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
like measles polio or whooping cough but
 
02:53:11.510 --> 02:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is not about those life-saving
 
02:53:13.750 --> 02:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines we're not here to talk about
 
02:53:17.349 --> 02:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
measles or chickenpox or even covid19
 
02:53:19.030 --> 02:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
we're here to talk about the backbone of
 
02:53:22.150 --> 02:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
the system the way the department and
 
02:53:24.389 --> 02:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers ensure
 
02:53:26.950 --> 02:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
that health records are accurate and
 
02:53:29.269 --> 02:53:29.279 align:start position:0%
that we have the best information to
 
02:53:32.389 --> 02:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
give to individuals and caregivers so
 
02:53:35.110 --> 02:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
that they can make the choices that are
 
02:53:37.030 --> 02:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
right for their families
 
02:53:40.230 --> 02:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
and right in our statute it says that no
 
02:53:43.910 --> 02:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
individual is required to participate in
 
02:53:46.469 --> 02:53:46.479 align:start position:0%
the immunization information system
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
no one is compelled
 
02:53:50.710 --> 02:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire immunization

the new hampshire iis does everything

that policy makers typically want it
 
02:55:13.030 --> 02:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
enables the department to effectively
 
02:55:15.429 --> 02:55:15.439 align:start position:0%
manage its resources it consolidates
 
02:55:17.269 --> 02:55:17.279 align:start position:0%
data from multiple places and it
 
02:55:19.110 --> 02:55:19.120 align:start position:0%

and
 
02:55:27.110 --> 02:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
if the individual doesn't want to
 
02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
participate there is an easy way to say
 
02:55:33.269 --> 02:55:33.279 align:start position:0%
no thank you your health care provider
 
02:55:35.750 --> 02:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
provides the information
 
02:55:37.990 --> 02:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
to have the
 
02:55:40.070 --> 02:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
opt out i have the opt-out form i will
 
02:55:41.269 --> 02:55:41.279 align:start position:0%
send it to you
 
02:55:42.950 --> 02:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
and they can provide that information to
 
02:55:45.110 --> 02:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
you and all of us can google it right
 
02:55:47.190 --> 02:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
now off our phones
 
02:55:50.150 --> 02:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
hb 1606 proposes to make
 
02:55:52.710 --> 02:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire iis opt in
 
02:55:54.790 --> 02:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
this will do exactly what policy makers
 
02:55:57.510 --> 02:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
have asked us repeatedly not to do it
 
02:55:59.670 --> 02:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
will make the process more cumbersome
 
02:56:02.950 --> 02:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
complicated and costly the current
 
02:56:06.309 --> 02:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
opt-out process respects an individual's
 
02:56:08.790 --> 02:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
right to privacy while ensuring that we
 
02:56:11.349 --> 02:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
can be accountable for our publicly
 
02:56:14.389 --> 02:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
purchased vaccines ensure that quality
 
02:56:16.550 --> 02:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
help ensure quality health care for kids
 
02:56:19.030 --> 02:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
and adults and give us the data needed
 
02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
to control those infectious disease
 
02:56:22.790 --> 02:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
outbreaks within our community
 
02:56:26.630 --> 02:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
again by rule no information can be
 
02:56:29.750 --> 02:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
submitted to the registry without the
 
02:56:32.630 --> 02:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to opt out
 
02:56:34.230 --> 02:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
on the other hand
 
02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
opt-in programs in other states have
 
02:56:39.269 --> 02:56:39.279 align:start position:0%
been costly they create unnecessary
 
02:56:41.269 --> 02:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
paperwork and lead to incomplete and
 
02:56:43.830 --> 02:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
lower quality data needed to protect the
 
02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:44.950 align:start position:0%
lower quality data needed to protect the
patient

02:56:44.950 --> 02:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
patient
 
02:56:46.710 --> 02:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
and the community
 
02:56:49.670 --> 02:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
however we are not like other states we
 
02:56:52.389 --> 02:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
deeply respect new hampshire's culture
 
02:56:54.389 --> 02:56:54.399 align:start position:0%
of privacy and choice
 
02:56:56.469 --> 02:56:56.479 align:start position:0%
and that is why opting out of the new
 
02:56:58.230 --> 02:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire iis has
 
02:57:00.550 --> 02:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
been designed to be straightforward
 
02:57:03.349 --> 02:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
administrative rules hep 307 outline the
 
02:57:05.670 --> 02:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
process for patients to opt out if a
 
02:57:07.830 --> 02:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine recipient indicates they want to
 
02:57:10.389 --> 02:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
opt out their health care provider is
 
02:57:12.790 --> 02:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
required to complete
 
02:57:15.750 --> 02:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:17.830 --> 02:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
that form is held by the health care
 
02:57:19.990 --> 02:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
provider and directs them to ensure that
 
02:57:22.389 --> 02:57:22.399 align:start position:0%
the information is not
 
02:57:24.790 --> 02:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
sent to the state
 
02:57:27.429 --> 02:57:27.439 align:start position:0%
public health should never know who has
 
02:57:28.870 --> 02:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
opted out
 
02:57:31.670 --> 02:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
privacy is protected
 
02:57:34.550 --> 02:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
the department urges policy makers to
 
02:57:37.269 --> 02:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
consider the experience of texas one of
 
02:57:39.190 --> 02:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
the only two or three states in the
 
02:57:42.230 --> 02:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
country with an opt-in policy
 
02:57:44.469 --> 02:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
texas right now is working to implement
 
02:57:47.190 --> 02:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
a change to become opt-out after
 
02:57:49.269 --> 02:57:49.279 align:start position:0%
conducting an evaluation of the cost of
 
02:57:52.070 --> 02:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
their opt in model that found that it
 
02:57:55.030 --> 02:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
cost two to two and a half dollars per
 
02:57:57.750 --> 02:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
child compared to the estimated cost of
 
02:58:01.590 --> 02:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
about 30 cents per child with an opt out
 
02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:02.630 align:start position:0%
about 30 cents per child with an opt out
model

02:58:02.630 --> 02:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
model
 
02:58:05.429 --> 02:58:05.439 align:start position:0%
the additional cost for texas's opt-in
 
02:58:08.630 --> 02:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
iis was estimated to be well over a
 
02:58:11.670 --> 02:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars annually new hampshire's
 
02:58:14.870 --> 02:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
health care providers cannot afford that
 
02:58:17.190 --> 02:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
additional burden
 
02:58:19.190 --> 02:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
fewer than five percent of new hampshire
 
02:58:21.910 --> 02:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine recipients are estimated to
 
02:58:25.110 --> 02:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
desire the added pro privacy of opting
 
02:58:27.429 --> 02:58:27.439 align:start position:0%
out of the new hampshire iis
 
02:58:30.630 --> 02:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of individuals value
 
02:58:34.389 --> 02:58:34.399 align:start position:0%
the benefits of full participation
 
02:58:36.309 --> 02:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
i will take a minute here to talk a
 
02:58:38.389 --> 02:58:38.399 align:start position:0%
little bit about covid because as you've
 
02:58:40.309 --> 02:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
heard from the hospital association
 
02:58:42.950 --> 02:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
covet 19 vaccine was a different sort of
 
02:58:42.960 --> 02:58:44.309 align:start position:0%
covet 19 vaccine was a different sort of
animal

02:58:44.309 --> 02:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
animal
 
02:58:46.630 --> 02:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
many of us many adults in this room
 
02:58:48.710 --> 02:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
received their vaccines within a
 
02:58:50.550 --> 02:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacy setting
 
02:58:52.550 --> 02:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
those vaccines were provided to the
 
02:58:54.950 --> 02:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
pharmacies by the federal government not
 
02:58:56.710 --> 02:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
02:58:59.349 --> 02:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
that data went directly to the federal
 
02:59:01.830 --> 02:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
government it did not pass go and enter
 
02:59:04.469 --> 02:59:04.479 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire iis system and
 
02:59:06.230 --> 02:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
therefore you were not given an
 
02:59:08.790 --> 02:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity in some cases to opt out
 
02:59:10.550 --> 02:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
because that data never went to us in
 
02:59:12.389 --> 02:59:12.399 align:start position:0%
the first place so i just want to make
 
02:59:13.990 --> 02:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
sure and if there are other questions
 
02:59:15.670 --> 02:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
about that i'm happy to answer those
 
02:59:15.680 --> 02:59:17.830 align:start position:0%
about that i'm happy to answer those
later

02:59:17.830 --> 02:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
later
 
02:59:20.870 --> 02:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
changing the new hampshire iis to an
 
02:59:23.670 --> 02:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
opt-in system will require healthcare
 
02:59:25.670 --> 02:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
providers to work harder
 
02:59:27.510 --> 02:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
not smarter
 
02:59:29.830 --> 02:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
an opt-in system will increase
 
02:59:32.230 --> 02:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
cost and unnecessary paperwork for
 
02:59:34.389 --> 02:59:34.399 align:start position:0%
everyone it will create additional
 
02:59:36.950 --> 02:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
burden for the majority of individuals
 
02:59:39.910 --> 02:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
that want the convenience and safety of
 
02:59:41.750 --> 02:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
a consolidated record
 
02:59:44.150 --> 02:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
the current opt-out system securely
 
02:59:46.630 --> 02:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
balances the need for choice
 
02:59:49.110 --> 02:59:49.120 align:start position:0%
and optimal convenience for individuals
 
02:59:51.349 --> 02:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
and health care providers
 
02:59:52.870 --> 02:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is not about what you think
 
02:59:55.990 --> 02:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
about covet or covid vaccines it's not
 
02:59:58.150 --> 02:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
about potential requirements for school
 
03:00:01.190 --> 03:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
or for work what this bill does is make
 
03:00:03.590 --> 03:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
things unnecessarily more complicated
 
03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
and costly for the vast majority of new
 
03:00:07.670 --> 03:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents
 
03:00:11.750 --> 03:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
we urge the committee to oppose hp 1606
 
03:00:14.710 --> 03:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
and i will provide examples for you of
 
03:00:16.630 --> 03:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
our opt out form
 
03:00:18.710 --> 03:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
and the sort of documentation that we
 
03:00:20.950 --> 03:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
have used in our latest booster blitz
 
03:00:23.590 --> 03:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
for covid that talks a little bit about
 
03:00:25.510 --> 03:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire iis and helps to
 
03:00:25.520 --> 03:00:26.710 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire iis and helps to
provide

03:00:26.710 --> 03:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
provide
 
03:00:29.269 --> 03:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
information for all vaccine recipients
 
03:00:30.710 --> 03:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
so they can make the choice that's right
 
03:00:33.510 --> 03:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
for them thank you chair
 
03:00:39.670 --> 03:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:42.550 --> 03:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative gay thank you mr chairman
 
03:00:44.870 --> 03:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you i will ask that same
 
03:00:46.870 --> 03:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
question that i just asked a few minutes
 
03:00:46.880 --> 03:00:48.150 align:start position:0%
question that i just asked a few minutes
ago

03:00:48.150 --> 03:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
ago
 
03:00:48.160 --> 03:00:49.110 align:start position:0%
ago
how

03:00:49.110 --> 03:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
how
 
03:00:52.150 --> 03:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
what's the nuts and bolts of the uh
 
03:00:55.269 --> 03:00:55.279 align:start position:0%
provider who gave the shot to the child
 
03:00:57.349 --> 03:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
i'll use that old-fashioned term
 
03:00:59.910 --> 03:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
i didn't get immunizations as a child i
 
03:01:01.110 --> 03:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
got shots
 
03:01:04.790 --> 03:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay so how do they input the fact that
 
03:01:07.510 --> 03:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
this patient either
 
03:01:09.830 --> 03:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
that they got that they got a shot how
 
03:01:12.710 --> 03:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
do they put that information in
 
03:01:14.710 --> 03:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative and i
 
03:01:16.790 --> 03:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
too do not work in a pediatrician's
 
03:01:18.469 --> 03:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
office so i know that some of the
 
03:01:20.150 --> 03:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
pediatricians that are coming up to
 
03:01:21.429 --> 03:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
speak can talk about how they
 
03:01:24.070 --> 03:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
operationalize that directly in their
 
03:01:26.790 --> 03:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
offices what we know from the department
 
03:01:28.870 --> 03:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
however is that information does not
 
03:01:31.830 --> 03:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
ever go into the iis they're offered the
 
03:01:34.630 --> 03:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to not participate in the
 
03:01:37.590 --> 03:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
iis and if the parent says no that
 
03:01:40.469 --> 03:01:40.479 align:start position:0%
information does not get sent to us they
 
03:01:42.070 --> 03:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
manage their own electronic health
 
03:01:44.230 --> 03:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
record within their own entity and i'm
 
03:01:45.830 --> 03:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
sure that they can talk more about how
 
03:01:47.670 --> 03:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
that process works but the most
 
03:01:49.190 --> 03:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
important information to understand is
 
03:01:50.550 --> 03:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
that the information does not get
 
03:01:52.070 --> 03:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
relayed to new to the department of
 
03:01:54.150 --> 03:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
03:01:55.590 --> 03:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
one follow-up
 
03:01:57.830 --> 03:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
does this information have to go to a
 
03:01:59.910 --> 03:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
federal collection i just heard that for
 
03:02:02.550 --> 03:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
the first time thank you for the
 
03:02:05.670 --> 03:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to clarify that covet 19 was
 
03:02:08.230 --> 03:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
totally different than anything else
 
03:02:11.110 --> 03:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
so um so the reason i was speaking about
 
03:02:12.550 --> 03:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
information going direct to the feds
 
03:02:14.790 --> 03:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
because it was about covid19 vaccine but
 
03:02:16.950 --> 03:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
for your typical measles mumps rubella
 
03:02:19.190 --> 03:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
polio that information does not go to
 
03:02:20.950 --> 03:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
the federal government we provide an
 
03:02:24.309 --> 03:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
aggregate amount okay thank you
 
03:02:27.830 --> 03:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:30.389 --> 03:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
after we've heard from miss mccurry
 
03:02:31.910 --> 03:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the record my name
 
03:02:33.349 --> 03:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
is anne marie mccurry i'm the
 
03:02:34.790 --> 03:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
immunization section chief for the
 
03:02:36.870 --> 03:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
03:02:39.670 --> 03:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
i also just wanted to provide further
 
03:02:41.910 --> 03:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
clarification that the department on
 
03:02:43.830 --> 03:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
covet vaccination any of the information
 
03:02:47.110 --> 03:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
that is in the nhiis that we are
 
03:02:49.830 --> 03:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
required to report to the cdc redacts
 
03:02:52.710 --> 03:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
any personal identifiable information
 
03:02:55.190 --> 03:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
therefore the cdc the federal government
 
03:02:58.230 --> 03:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
does not receive any identifiable
 
03:03:00.150 --> 03:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
information they would only have the
 
03:03:03.670 --> 03:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
information that for instance a male age
 
03:03:06.950 --> 03:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
35 living in manchester received a covet
 
03:03:06.960 --> 03:03:10.150 align:start position:0%
35 living in manchester received a covet
vaccination

03:03:10.150 --> 03:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:12.070 --> 03:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative canark thank you very
 
03:03:14.469 --> 03:03:14.479 align:start position:0%
much i'm still a little bit confused and
 
03:03:17.269 --> 03:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to clarify one thing so an
 
03:03:20.389 --> 03:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
opt out once a form is filed with one
 
03:03:20.399 --> 03:03:21.670 align:start position:0%
opt out once a form is filed with one
injection

03:03:21.670 --> 03:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
injection
 
03:03:23.830 --> 03:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
then that's captain file and
 
03:03:25.990 --> 03:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
the pediatrician's office or provider's
 
03:03:28.469 --> 03:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
office so they know that person is an
 
03:03:30.790 --> 03:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
opt-out and will be forever more until
 
03:03:32.950 --> 03:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
they change it they don't have to go
 
03:03:34.950 --> 03:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
through that each time is that first of
 
03:03:36.389 --> 03:03:36.399 align:start position:0%
all that's my first part and the second
 
03:03:38.469 --> 03:03:38.479 align:start position:0%
part then isn't the opt-in is it your
 
03:03:40.389 --> 03:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
impression that it would be different
 
03:03:42.389 --> 03:03:42.399 align:start position:0%
that the opt-in would have to be done
 
03:03:45.510 --> 03:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
for each immunization versus
 
03:03:47.670 --> 03:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
having it occur once and that would
 
03:03:49.269 --> 03:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
state to the pediatrician this is an
 
03:03:51.110 --> 03:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
opt-in person and everything is going to
 
03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:53.030 align:start position:0%
opt-in person and everything is going to
go

03:03:53.030 --> 03:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
go
 
03:03:54.389 --> 03:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
that is correct that is our
 
03:03:55.990 --> 03:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
understanding so again they're offered
 
03:03:57.910 --> 03:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to opt out the first
 
03:04:00.550 --> 03:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
time they have offered vaccine that i
 
03:04:03.349 --> 03:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
assume gets recorded within their ehr
 
03:04:04.950 --> 03:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
that information does not come to the
 
03:04:07.030 --> 03:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
03:04:07.040 --> 03:04:07.990 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
this

03:04:07.990 --> 03:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:04:10.230 --> 03:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
proposing to do an opt-in could
 
03:04:12.150 --> 03:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
potentially add increased burden to
 
03:04:13.510 --> 03:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
those healthcare providers by
 
03:04:16.230 --> 03:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
continually having to offer some sort of
 
03:04:18.950 --> 03:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
piece of paper and um process that both
 
03:04:20.870 --> 03:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
within their electronic record and
 
03:04:23.190 --> 03:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
certainly if it were a paper form that
 
03:04:25.030 --> 03:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
would certainly be additional burden to
 
03:04:26.710 --> 03:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
any healthcare provider
 
03:04:28.309 --> 03:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
a follow-up then please
 
03:04:30.230 --> 03:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
follow up would you be
 
03:04:32.469 --> 03:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
happier if this could be crafted such
 
03:04:34.630 --> 03:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
that if we were going to go with an
 
03:04:34.640 --> 03:04:35.910 align:start position:0%
that if we were going to go with an
opt-in

03:04:35.910 --> 03:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
opt-in
 
03:04:37.750 --> 03:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
that it would be instead that they would
 
03:04:39.590 --> 03:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
also fill it out once that would be kept
 
03:04:41.030 --> 03:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
on record of course it would have to be
 
03:04:43.590 --> 03:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
at each provider's place i understand
 
03:04:44.870 --> 03:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
but that would be once and they would
 
03:04:46.710 --> 03:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
keep it so it would work symmetrically
 
03:04:49.670 --> 03:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
with how the opt out works would that be
 
03:04:51.590 --> 03:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
less cumbersome or do you not foresee
 
03:04:53.510 --> 03:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
that that would be would solve that
 
03:04:53.520 --> 03:04:55.110 align:start position:0%
that that would be would solve that
problem

03:04:55.110 --> 03:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:04:57.830 --> 03:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
again the part of the problem or one of
 
03:04:59.510 --> 03:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
the concerns certainly not a problem but
 
03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns i think all of us
 
03:05:03.990 --> 03:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
will have to think about is we know that
 
03:05:07.030 --> 03:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of individuals
 
03:05:09.429 --> 03:05:09.439 align:start position:0%
will want to participate because it has
 
03:05:11.670 --> 03:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
benefits to them so right now you're
 
03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
looking at managing paper for a small
 
03:05:16.469 --> 03:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
proportion of people or your entire
 
03:05:19.830 --> 03:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
paper your entire patient population
 
03:05:22.309 --> 03:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
03:05:24.630 --> 03:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
03:05:26.950 --> 03:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:05:29.030 --> 03:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
and perhaps you can clarify something
 
03:05:31.269 --> 03:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
for me
 
03:05:33.349 --> 03:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
when the sponsor introduced this bill
 
03:05:35.349 --> 03:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
they um
 
03:05:38.309 --> 03:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
referred to child care agencies and
 
03:05:41.750 --> 03:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
schools and doctors offices
 
03:05:44.309 --> 03:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
um it sounded to me like they had
 
03:05:47.190 --> 03:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
general access to this database
 
03:05:49.190 --> 03:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
and could you explain
 
03:05:52.150 --> 03:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
if that is the case is it limited
 
03:05:54.870 --> 03:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
is do they have open access how it works
 
03:05:56.309 --> 03:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that question
 
03:05:58.630 --> 03:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative so as we've all heard we
 
03:06:01.030 --> 03:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
are launching the iis as we speak we are
 
03:06:02.550 --> 03:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
it is a new system we're moving it
 
03:06:05.830 --> 03:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
forward within the rules it gives us the
 
03:06:07.550 --> 03:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
authority to provide
 
03:06:10.550 --> 03:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
read-only access for child care
 
03:06:13.670 --> 03:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
providers and school nurses now you may
 
03:06:15.590 --> 03:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
ask why would those have an interest in
 
03:06:18.309 --> 03:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
looking at a read-only access of the
 
03:06:20.630 --> 03:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
patient or the students or the children
 
03:06:22.389 --> 03:06:22.399 align:start position:0%
that are within their care and that is
 
03:06:24.790 --> 03:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
because both school nurses and child
 
03:06:27.670 --> 03:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
care providers have a duty to ensure
 
03:06:30.150 --> 03:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
that immunizations are up-to-date for
 
03:06:32.710 --> 03:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
attendance when within either schools or
 
03:06:34.309 --> 03:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
child care so again this is not
 
03:06:35.910 --> 03:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly access
 
03:06:38.150 --> 03:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
this is access for the child care
 
03:06:39.830 --> 03:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
provider or the school nurse to
 
03:06:41.910 --> 03:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
determine if the children have
 
03:06:44.309 --> 03:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
up-to-date vaccine
 
03:06:44.319 --> 03:06:45.830 align:start position:0%
up-to-date vaccine
follow-up

03:06:45.830 --> 03:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:06:47.670 --> 03:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
so just to make sure i've got that
 
03:06:47.680 --> 03:06:50.230 align:start position:0%
so just to make sure i've got that
straight

03:06:50.230 --> 03:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:50.240 --> 03:06:51.750 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:06:51.750 --> 03:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:06:55.030 --> 03:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
family wants to send their children to a
 
03:06:56.389 --> 03:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
child care center
 
03:06:59.030 --> 03:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
the child care center in order to
 
03:07:01.269 --> 03:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
ascertain that the
 
03:07:03.990 --> 03:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
children have been vaccinated has some
 
03:07:06.550 --> 03:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
kind of access to this system can they
 
03:07:08.550 --> 03:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
see other people's information as well
 
03:07:13.110 --> 03:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:13.120 --> 03:07:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:07:13.990 --> 03:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:07:16.230 --> 03:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
authorized users are only out loud
 
03:07:18.630 --> 03:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
access to view the information that
 
03:07:20.710 --> 03:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
would be relevant for them so their
 
03:07:24.469 --> 03:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
their within their own patient profiles
 
03:07:25.830 --> 03:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
and i would just follow that up by
 
03:07:27.750 --> 03:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
saying so again if i brought my child to
 
03:07:30.309 --> 03:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
child care and i chose to opt out of the
 
03:07:33.349 --> 03:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
system i would be required to provide
 
03:07:36.309 --> 03:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
that documentation myself as opposed to
 
03:07:38.070 --> 03:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
the school nurse or the child care
 
03:07:40.309 --> 03:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
provider again looking at the group of
 
03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
individuals that they're authorized to
 
03:07:43.190 --> 03:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
look at
 
03:07:44.870 --> 03:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
and that they could determine if they
 
03:07:46.710 --> 03:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
are up to date with their vaccine so
 
03:07:48.550 --> 03:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
this is an opportunity for convenience
 
03:07:50.309 --> 03:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
for both the
 
03:07:55.590 --> 03:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:58.070 --> 03:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative shapiro
 
03:07:58.080 --> 03:07:59.830 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative shapiro
yes

03:07:59.830 --> 03:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:08:01.510 --> 03:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
so once again i just want to make sure i
 
03:08:05.670 --> 03:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
they have access to the students that
 
03:08:10.150 --> 03:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
are coming to their program
 
03:08:10.160 --> 03:08:11.990 align:start position:0%
are coming to their program
um

03:08:11.990 --> 03:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:15.670 --> 03:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
is that by um is there
 
03:08:18.550 --> 03:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
is that what's allowed or is there is
 
03:08:22.230 --> 03:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
the system actually not
 
03:08:24.230 --> 03:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
permit them to scroll through and see
 
03:08:25.910 --> 03:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
other information
 
03:08:27.830 --> 03:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
the authorized users are signing a
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and user provider
 
03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:31.269 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and user provider
agreement

03:08:31.269 --> 03:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
03:08:35.110 --> 03:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
that specifies their ability to look at
 
03:08:37.110 --> 03:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
specific records
 
03:08:40.309 --> 03:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative leon
 
03:08:42.150 --> 03:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you both
 
03:08:44.550 --> 03:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
for being here to take these questions
 
03:08:46.389 --> 03:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
with the child care providers are they
 
03:08:48.389 --> 03:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
providing a list of all the children who
 
03:08:50.389 --> 03:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
are in their care to the state in order
 
03:08:54.389 --> 03:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:54.399 --> 03:08:55.429 align:start position:0%
 
no

03:08:55.429 --> 03:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:08:56.950 --> 03:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you can i have a
 
03:08:58.469 --> 03:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up that one i had to ask you you
 
03:09:00.710 --> 03:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
may have a follow-up thank you my other
 
03:09:02.309 --> 03:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
question is we're hearing about people
 
03:09:03.750 --> 03:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
who who don't feel that they were
 
03:09:06.150 --> 03:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
informed about the opt-out process is
 
03:09:08.150 --> 03:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
there any recourse for them is are there
 
03:09:10.070 --> 03:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
any penalties for people who don't
 
03:09:12.389 --> 03:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
doctors who don't inform
 
03:09:14.950 --> 03:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
we do not have a penalties in place
 
03:09:17.510 --> 03:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
right now however there is a system also
 
03:09:20.309 --> 03:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
to withdraw your information so once you
 
03:09:20.319 --> 03:09:21.269 align:start position:0%
to withdraw your information so once you
agree

03:09:21.269 --> 03:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
agree
 
03:09:24.070 --> 03:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
to allow or you passively agree in this
 
03:09:26.630 --> 03:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
case um you don't opt out of the system
 
03:09:28.070 --> 03:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
but you have a change of heart and you
 
03:09:30.070 --> 03:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
would like to remove your information
 
03:09:31.510 --> 03:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
there's a process by which you can
 
03:09:35.190 --> 03:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:37.190 --> 03:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
and also if i may add
 
03:09:39.110 --> 03:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's very important for us to also be
 
03:09:41.030 --> 03:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
aware that not all immunization
 
03:09:43.030 --> 03:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
providers are required to report to the
 
03:09:44.710 --> 03:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire iaas
 
03:09:46.950 --> 03:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
so those providers who are not providing
 
03:09:50.309 --> 03:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
publicly funded vaccine would not be
 
03:09:52.070 --> 03:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
required it would be a voluntary
 
03:09:53.990 --> 03:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
participation so these conversations
 
03:09:55.750 --> 03:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
would only be taking place
 
03:09:58.790 --> 03:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
in those offices where a publicly funded
 
03:10:01.910 --> 03:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine were being administered so
 
03:10:03.510 --> 03:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
we just have to be very careful about
 
03:10:03.520 --> 03:10:04.710 align:start position:0%
we just have to be very careful about
knowing

03:10:04.710 --> 03:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
knowing
 
03:10:06.710 --> 03:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
when it is appropriate to have that
 
03:10:09.190 --> 03:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
conversation about iis and their
 
03:10:11.750 --> 03:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to opt out because it is not
 
03:10:14.309 --> 03:10:14.319 align:start position:0%
for every vaccination event
 
03:10:15.269 --> 03:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:10:19.110 --> 03:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:19.120 --> 03:10:19.990 align:start position:0%
 
she

03:10:19.990 --> 03:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
she
 
03:10:21.670 --> 03:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
eloquently answered the question i was
 
03:10:23.750 --> 03:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
going to ask thank you representative
 
03:10:26.070 --> 03:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
cushman thank you mr chairman thank you
 
03:10:27.750 --> 03:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:10:31.429 --> 03:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
um so uh just a quick clarifier um so
 
03:10:32.790 --> 03:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
are you saying that the covet
 
03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
vaccination information um is not
 
03:10:41.990 --> 03:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:45.110 --> 03:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
we made every attempt to get all
 
03:10:47.990 --> 03:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
information on covid into the iis during
 
03:10:50.309 --> 03:10:50.319 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency
 
03:10:52.870 --> 03:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
that was a requirement to do so the
 
03:10:55.349 --> 03:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to opt out was temporarily
 
03:10:57.910 --> 03:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
suspended under the emergency order
 
03:11:00.150 --> 03:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
the department is very much wanting to
 
03:11:02.950 --> 03:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
work with the legislation here to
 
03:11:05.750 --> 03:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
ensure that people do have the
 
03:11:08.389 --> 03:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
information and their ability to
 
03:11:10.229 --> 03:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
withdraw should they not want that
 
03:11:12.229 --> 03:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
information to be retained
 
03:11:15.750 --> 03:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
the department is also aware that
 
03:11:17.670 --> 03:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
not all providers such as federal
 
03:11:20.630 --> 03:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
pharmacies were participating in the iis
 
03:11:22.469 --> 03:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
at the time so they were not offering
 
03:11:24.630 --> 03:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
that opportunity to opt out we are
 
03:11:26.870 --> 03:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
working with our federal partners to go
 
03:11:28.150 --> 03:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
ahead and
 
03:11:29.990 --> 03:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
be able to give that information to us
 
03:11:33.670 --> 03:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
in the future but the department has
 
03:11:36.070 --> 03:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
specifically stated to them we will not
 
03:11:38.469 --> 03:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
accept your data because you did not
 
03:11:41.030 --> 03:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
provide that opportunity to opt out so
 
03:11:45.030 --> 03:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
not all data is in the iis for covid
 
03:11:47.269 --> 03:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
yes i'll just confirm that our data set
 
03:11:49.510 --> 03:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
is incomplete as many of you have heard
 
03:11:51.510 --> 03:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
in the media and for all of these
 
03:11:53.830 --> 03:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
complex reasons we received some during
 
03:11:56.309 --> 03:11:56.319 align:start position:0%
the emergency order so up until about
 
03:12:01.670 --> 03:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
june of 2021 from 20 early 21 to june we
 
03:12:02.870 --> 03:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
were receiving
 
03:12:05.590 --> 03:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of data then we received
 
03:12:08.710 --> 03:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
less data after july
 
03:12:10.229 --> 03:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:12:11.990 --> 03:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um
 
03:12:15.110 --> 03:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay so and i understand that the
 
03:12:16.229 --> 03:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
part of that
 
03:12:18.389 --> 03:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
problem was that the system was getting
 
03:12:21.110 --> 03:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
set up and you were working out the bugs
 
03:12:23.030 --> 03:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
um but i it's my also my understanding
 
03:12:24.309 --> 03:12:24.319 align:start position:0%
that that's been going on a very long
 
03:12:26.630 --> 03:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
time can you tell me exactly how many
 
03:12:29.030 --> 03:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
years and how much money
 
03:12:31.030 --> 03:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
and how many requests for increases in
 
03:12:33.269 --> 03:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
funding have been brought
 
03:12:35.349 --> 03:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
for this system
 
03:12:37.030 --> 03:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
since the beginning
 
03:12:38.790 --> 03:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's a very complicated question thank
 
03:12:40.710 --> 03:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
you and i cannot provide you off the top
 
03:12:42.550 --> 03:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
of my head a list of all those dollar
 
03:12:44.070 --> 03:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
amounts we have worked with the
 
03:12:47.190 --> 03:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
legislature as you notice for and as the
 
03:12:49.349 --> 03:12:49.359 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill noted for almost
 
03:12:51.830 --> 03:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
decades now to determine how we set up
 
03:12:55.269 --> 03:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
our immunization registry technology
 
03:12:58.469 --> 03:12:58.479 align:start position:0%
funding and concerns around privacy have
 
03:13:00.790 --> 03:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
always been drivers of how we move
 
03:13:02.950 --> 03:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
forward so we have had some stops and
 
03:13:05.190 --> 03:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
starts we have had funding over time
 
03:13:07.269 --> 03:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
that has not been available or been
 
03:13:10.469 --> 03:13:10.479 align:start position:0%
available and um we worked very closely
 
03:13:12.790 --> 03:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
with the with the legislature to ensure
 
03:13:15.269 --> 03:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
that our rulemaking
 
03:13:17.990 --> 03:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
provided the best privacy protections as
 
03:13:19.910 --> 03:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
possible so that's my roundabout way of
 
03:13:21.750 --> 03:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
saying to you i don't have the complete
 
03:13:24.150 --> 03:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
list of dollars right now
 
03:13:24.160 --> 03:13:24.950 align:start position:0%
list of dollars right now
with

03:13:24.950 --> 03:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:13:27.670 --> 03:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
the covid19 pandemic we received
 
03:13:30.870 --> 03:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
additional funding from cdc to support
 
03:13:33.670 --> 03:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
the development of the iis we were going
 
03:13:36.309 --> 03:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
down this path anyway at this time we
 
03:13:39.670 --> 03:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
were on track to implement in 20 and 21
 
03:13:42.150 --> 03:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic these things came
 
03:13:45.030 --> 03:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
together at the perfect confluence of
 
03:13:47.910 --> 03:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
both additional funds and the need to be
 
03:13:50.150 --> 03:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
able to have a system to track all of
 
03:13:52.229 --> 03:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
these complex vaccines that are take
 
03:13:54.070 --> 03:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
that took place over the past year and a
 
03:13:54.080 --> 03:13:58.070 align:start position:0%
that took place over the past year and a
half

03:13:58.070 --> 03:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:04.389 --> 03:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
chair calls laura condon from bedford
 
03:14:06.630 --> 03:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
she's asked to speak for three minutes
 
03:14:16.309 --> 03:14:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:18.630 --> 03:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much my name is laura
 
03:14:20.630 --> 03:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
condon i'm from bedford i'm a new
 
03:14:22.309 --> 03:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire director of advocacy with the
 
03:14:24.550 --> 03:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
national vaccine information center and
 
03:14:26.389 --> 03:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
i have served for five years as public
 
03:14:27.750 --> 03:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
member in the board of directors of the
 
03:14:29.830 --> 03:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire vaccine association there
 
03:14:32.870 --> 03:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
has been some repeated misinformation
 
03:14:34.950 --> 03:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
that i really need to correct before i
 
03:14:37.030 --> 03:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
get to my own testimony
 
03:14:39.110 --> 03:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
nowhere in current law is their mention
 
03:14:41.510 --> 03:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
of opt-in and opt-out
 
03:14:43.269 --> 03:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
and representative lang spoke to that
 
03:14:45.269 --> 03:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
but the intention of the law is clear
 
03:14:47.910 --> 03:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
that it was intended to be voluntary
 
03:14:51.349 --> 03:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
then very very importantly if you look
 
03:14:54.790 --> 03:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
at the statute for the immunization
 
03:14:58.070 --> 03:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
registry there is no mention anywheres
 
03:15:01.750 --> 03:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
of an iis or an immunization information
 
03:15:04.870 --> 03:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
system this is not a mincing of words
 
03:15:07.110 --> 03:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
they are two very completely different
 
03:15:07.120 --> 03:15:08.550 align:start position:0%
they are two very completely different
programs

03:15:08.550 --> 03:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
programs
 
03:15:10.950 --> 03:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
what statute does is statute has
 
03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
authorized a vaccination registry an iis
 
03:15:18.550 --> 03:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
is two components one component is a
 
03:15:21.190 --> 03:15:21.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine ordering an inventory program
 
03:15:23.990 --> 03:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
and the second component is the registry
 
03:15:26.309 --> 03:15:26.319 align:start position:0%
only the registry is provided for in
 
03:15:29.190 --> 03:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
statute and in fact the
 
03:15:31.030 --> 03:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
inventory and ordering program would
 
03:15:33.990 --> 03:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
never have even been anticipated in 1988
 
03:15:36.550 --> 03:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
1998 when this was enacted because at
 
03:15:39.110 --> 03:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
that point in time the state was not in
 
03:15:40.950 --> 03:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
the vaccine business
 
03:15:43.269 --> 03:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
vaccines were purchased and held in
 
03:15:45.510 --> 03:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
inventory by doctors who provided
 
03:15:48.150 --> 03:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines so this constant repeating of
 
03:15:51.349 --> 03:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
an iis attempts to stretch the law and
 
03:15:53.030 --> 03:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
incorporate something that is not
 
03:15:55.030 --> 03:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
provided in statute and you really need
 
03:15:56.389 --> 03:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:15:59.670 --> 03:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:02.309 --> 03:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
so then the points i i would make like
 
03:16:06.309 --> 03:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
to me is that privacy is is essential
 
03:16:06.319 --> 03:16:07.190 align:start position:0%
to me is that privacy is is essential
and

03:16:07.190 --> 03:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:16:10.469 --> 03:16:10.479 align:start position:0%
the opt in would protect privacy state
 
03:16:12.630 --> 03:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
law requires that vaccine providers keep
 
03:16:15.349 --> 03:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
a record of vaccinations they give your
 
03:16:17.510 --> 03:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
doctor has a record of your vaccines
 
03:16:19.190 --> 03:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
state law requires your doctor or
 
03:16:20.550 --> 03:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacist give you a record of
 
03:16:23.030 --> 03:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
vaccination the time of vaccination you
 
03:16:24.790 --> 03:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
have a record
 
03:16:26.950 --> 03:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
if your child is in school or daycare
 
03:16:29.110 --> 03:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
the school or daycare requires a record
 
03:16:31.510 --> 03:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
they have a record the state vaccination
 
03:16:34.630 --> 03:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
registry not an iis is a duplication of
 
03:16:36.950 --> 03:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
vaccination records already required
 
03:16:38.950 --> 03:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
multiple times
 
03:16:41.830 --> 03:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
the rules do not create an effective and
 
03:16:44.870 --> 03:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
cost efficient registry
 
03:16:47.190 --> 03:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
in statute it says as written the
 
03:16:49.830 --> 03:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination registry rules
 
03:16:52.469 --> 03:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
shall promote promote effective and cost
 
03:16:54.309 --> 03:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
efficient disease prevention and control
 
03:16:54.319 --> 03:16:55.429 align:start position:0%
efficient disease prevention and control
efforts

03:16:55.429 --> 03:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
03:16:57.269 --> 03:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
the question was asked how much money
 
03:16:58.469 --> 03:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
has been spent
 
03:17:00.790 --> 03:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
on this vaccination registry
 
03:17:00.800 --> 03:17:01.710 align:start position:0%
on this vaccination registry
in

03:17:01.710 --> 03:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:17:06.309 --> 03:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
2014 1.36 million was given to dhhs
 
03:17:08.150 --> 03:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
through the executive council for this
 
03:17:08.160 --> 03:17:09.269 align:start position:0%
through the executive council for this
registry

03:17:09.269 --> 03:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
registry
 
03:17:12.309 --> 03:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
an additional 15.5 million was given in
 
03:17:12.319 --> 03:17:13.830 align:start position:0%
an additional 15.5 million was given in
2019

03:17:13.830 --> 03:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
2019
 
03:17:15.510 --> 03:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
and at that point it threw the executive
 
03:17:17.830 --> 03:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
council from the cdc and at that point
 
03:17:19.590 --> 03:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
in time at that executive council
 
03:17:22.309 --> 03:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
hearing dhhs testified that their this
 
03:17:25.990 --> 03:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
was 2019 that their registry was active
 
03:17:28.309 --> 03:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
you heard today them admitting they're
 
03:17:30.790 --> 03:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
just getting it active now miss condon i
 
03:17:33.190 --> 03:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
will stretch it and give you one more
 
03:17:36.710 --> 03:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
minute i appreciate that mr chairman um
 
03:17:39.030 --> 03:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
the vaccination registry is not workable
 
03:17:40.790 --> 03:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
for doctors they are overwhelmed with
 
03:17:42.790 --> 03:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
the work this creates at the january
 
03:17:44.870 --> 03:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
19th vaccine association board meeting
 
03:17:47.349 --> 03:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
board member pediatrician dr pat edwards
 
03:17:50.710 --> 03:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
complained to dhhs board member and
 
03:17:52.870 --> 03:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
mccree mccreary that her practice is
 
03:17:54.389 --> 03:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
totally bogged down by the state
 
03:17:56.550 --> 03:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
vaccination registry and she fears she
 
03:17:58.710 --> 03:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
may not able to receive vaccines and her
 
03:18:04.389 --> 03:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:05.990 --> 03:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
there i you know people are being told
 
03:18:07.510 --> 03:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
they're given the opportunity to opt out
 
03:18:09.269 --> 03:18:09.279 align:start position:0%
in fact hannaford
 
03:18:11.590 --> 03:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
pharmacy is violating that provision
 
03:18:13.030 --> 03:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
when you look at their form to get a
 
03:18:15.269 --> 03:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
vaccination you consent to vaccination
 
03:18:16.870 --> 03:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
buried in tiny font in the middle of
 
03:18:19.269 --> 03:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
that says that you will participate in a
 
03:18:21.830 --> 03:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
state vaccination database makes no
 
03:18:23.910 --> 03:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't define it as a registry and
 
03:18:25.670 --> 03:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
there's no opportunity to opt out if you
 
03:18:27.910 --> 03:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
want a vaccine you must consent to the
 
03:18:30.229 --> 03:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
registry they are violating state law
 
03:18:32.630 --> 03:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
they have been for years
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
there is no evidence that this vaccine
 
03:18:38.630 --> 03:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
registry is useful for preventing
 
03:18:41.910 --> 03:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
disease or outbreaks
 
03:18:44.309 --> 03:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
it has become a marketing database and i
 
03:18:46.950 --> 03:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
urge consideration of requiring that
 
03:18:49.269 --> 03:18:49.279 align:start position:0%
there be a user fee for those that use
 
03:18:51.910 --> 03:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
this database doctors pharmacists that
 
03:18:54.229 --> 03:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
they fund this given thank you very much
 
03:18:55.830 --> 03:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
now thank you
 
03:19:04.229 --> 03:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:05.750 --> 03:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
we can do that
 
03:19:08.510 --> 03:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
rep you got to come back
 
03:19:10.710 --> 03:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
03:19:12.229 --> 03:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:19:14.229 --> 03:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:19:14.239 --> 03:19:15.110 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

03:19:15.110 --> 03:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:15.120 --> 03:19:15.910 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:19:15.910 --> 03:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:19:18.389 --> 03:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that
 
03:19:20.469 --> 03:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
many people are not being made aware
 
03:19:22.630 --> 03:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
that they have the opportunity to opt
 
03:19:22.640 --> 03:19:23.590 align:start position:0%
that they have the opportunity to opt
out

03:19:23.590 --> 03:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:19:25.429 --> 03:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
for those
 
03:19:27.110 --> 03:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with
 
03:19:29.510 --> 03:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
some stories about some practices
 
03:19:31.269 --> 03:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
sending out an email saying you have
 
03:19:34.229 --> 03:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
until this date to opt out and
 
03:19:37.030 --> 03:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
checking off that that was providing the
 
03:19:40.309 --> 03:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity and in that situation isn't
 
03:19:42.550 --> 03:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
it likely that many would have missed
 
03:19:45.429 --> 03:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
that message and then unconstitutionally
 
03:19:47.670 --> 03:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
had their data swept into a government
 
03:19:47.680 --> 03:19:52.630 align:start position:0%
had their data swept into a government
database

03:19:52.630 --> 03:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:53.990 --> 03:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question
 
03:19:55.590 --> 03:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative cushman in fact i'm well
 
03:19:56.950 --> 03:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
aware of that
 
03:19:58.790 --> 03:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
because as an advocate parents send me
 
03:20:01.750 --> 03:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
those letters and those were sent out
 
03:20:03.990 --> 03:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
last year to parents from a few
 
03:20:05.750 --> 03:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
different practices that i got them from
 
03:20:07.750 --> 03:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
and parents were given 10 days to opt
 
03:20:10.229 --> 03:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
out so if they happen to be on vacation
 
03:20:12.150 --> 03:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
miss that email whatever they were
 
03:20:14.150 --> 03:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
automatically swept in there's no
 
03:20:15.990 --> 03:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
provision and statute or rules that
 
03:20:18.150 --> 03:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
limits you to a 10-day opt-out period
 
03:20:19.830 --> 03:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
but in fact they were given a 10-day
 
03:20:21.590 --> 03:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
opt-out they were scrambling couldn't
 
03:20:23.590 --> 03:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
find the forms as we've heard before the
 
03:20:25.750 --> 03:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
forms are very difficult to find they're
 
03:20:28.469 --> 03:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
not provided by doctors so yes i would
 
03:20:29.990 --> 03:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
say very much so that there probably
 
03:20:32.229 --> 03:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
many people got swept into this registry
 
03:20:33.990 --> 03:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
had no intentions of being part of the
 
03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:39.190 align:start position:0%
had no intentions of being part of the
registry

03:20:39.190 --> 03:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:41.590 --> 03:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
let me ask a question
 
03:20:44.150 --> 03:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
medical practices and the
 
03:20:47.269 --> 03:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
increased amount of work paperwork that
 
03:20:49.510 --> 03:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
they will be facing has been cited
 
03:20:51.349 --> 03:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
several times
 
03:20:54.070 --> 03:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
i cannot speak for every group in new
 
03:20:55.670 --> 03:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire but i can speak for the one of
 
03:20:58.550 --> 03:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
which i'm ceo
 
03:21:00.950 --> 03:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
i while i really don't want my people to
 
03:21:02.950 --> 03:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
have to do more work
 
03:21:04.710 --> 03:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
i have actually discussed this issue
 
03:21:06.469 --> 03:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
with my staff
 
03:21:08.630 --> 03:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
and the general consensus is this is the
 
03:21:12.070 --> 03:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
price we got to pay for freedom
 
03:21:14.550 --> 03:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
would you believe that
 
03:21:16.469 --> 03:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the price is that
 
03:21:19.349 --> 03:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
you're referring to extra work and more
 
03:21:21.830 --> 03:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
cost on the part of the
 
03:21:24.389 --> 03:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
local provider if you would stipulate as
 
03:21:26.870 --> 03:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
others have said that if we have an
 
03:21:28.870 --> 03:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
opt-in program
 
03:21:31.269 --> 03:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
it'll take more paperwork
 
03:21:33.590 --> 03:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
my staff says more paperwork as much as
 
03:21:35.190 --> 03:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
they don't want to do it
 
03:21:38.550 --> 03:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
is the price that we need to pay to keep
 
03:21:39.990 --> 03:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
our freedoms
 
03:21:42.550 --> 03:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
well i i think they misunderstand that
 
03:21:44.389 --> 03:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
um as i have testified it was
 
03:21:46.630 --> 03:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
pediatrician patricia
 
03:21:48.950 --> 03:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
edwards who did um speak to the vaccine
 
03:21:51.269 --> 03:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
association that her practice is
 
03:21:53.990 --> 03:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
actually overwhelmed by this registry um
 
03:21:56.309 --> 03:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
she fears her staff will quit it is very
 
03:21:58.630 --> 03:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
burdensome for the enter the the
 
03:22:00.790 --> 03:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
information and in fact if a patient
 
03:22:02.070 --> 03:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
opts out
 
03:22:04.950 --> 03:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
the doctor only gets the um excuse me if
 
03:22:07.349 --> 03:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
the patient didn't opt in the doctor
 
03:22:09.349 --> 03:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to do anything i will not
 
03:22:11.670 --> 03:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
attempt to restate my question right
 
03:22:13.269 --> 03:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
they don't need to enter representative
 
03:22:13.279 --> 03:22:14.389 align:start position:0%
they don't need to enter representative

03:22:14.389 --> 03:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
gay
 
03:22:16.710 --> 03:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you so much
 
03:22:17.990 --> 03:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
03:22:20.790 --> 03:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
if i understand this properly just what
 
03:22:24.070 --> 03:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
you said is the absolute truth if you
 
03:22:26.070 --> 03:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
choose not to be
 
03:22:28.389 --> 03:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
have your child or yourself
 
03:22:31.110 --> 03:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
entered into the registry it means the
 
03:22:34.389 --> 03:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
doctor or provider doesn't have to do
 
03:22:37.590 --> 03:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
anything right so no work less work not
 
03:22:37.600 --> 03:22:39.030 align:start position:0%
anything right so no work less work not
more

03:22:39.030 --> 03:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:22:43.590 --> 03:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative king
 
03:22:48.469 --> 03:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh thank you
 
03:22:51.349 --> 03:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
miss condra for the taking this question
 
03:22:51.359 --> 03:22:52.790 align:start position:0%
miss condra for the taking this question
um

03:22:52.790 --> 03:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:55.110 --> 03:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
i'm a little perplexed on one of the
 
03:22:58.630 --> 03:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
examples you gave of a provider that
 
03:23:01.110 --> 03:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't actually following the rules
 
03:23:02.389 --> 03:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
is is that
 
03:23:04.389 --> 03:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
kind of set up because the bill doesn't
 
03:23:06.469 --> 03:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
say opt-in or opt-out so they're kind of
 
03:23:08.469 --> 03:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
doing their own thing or
 
03:23:09.670 --> 03:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
is it
 
03:23:11.429 --> 03:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
or are there actually rules that they're
 
03:23:13.030 --> 03:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
following there are rules if you look at
 
03:23:18.150 --> 03:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
the rules you know written and approved
 
03:23:19.750 --> 03:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
by by gelcar
 
03:23:21.269 --> 03:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
um and and i
 
03:23:22.550 --> 03:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
posed those rules i don't think that
 
03:23:24.870 --> 03:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
there was full disclosure um it does
 
03:23:26.710 --> 03:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
require that you know and i will use
 
03:23:29.110 --> 03:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
hannaford as an example i do have their
 
03:23:32.229 --> 03:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
their form that a a customer must
 
03:23:34.950 --> 03:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
consent to to receive a vaccination
 
03:23:36.790 --> 03:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely no disclosure made in
 
03:23:39.349 --> 03:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
fact it refers to it as a state database
 
03:23:41.830 --> 03:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
it is does not identify it as a state
 
03:23:45.429 --> 03:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
vaccination registry so it um it muddies
 
03:23:47.750 --> 03:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
the waters and really misinforms
 
03:23:50.630 --> 03:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
consumers so they're not being properly
 
03:23:53.510 --> 03:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
informed as required in rules
 
03:23:56.830 --> 03:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:59.110 --> 03:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
you and thank you very much for your
 
03:24:01.990 --> 03:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you the chair calls uh
 
03:24:05.110 --> 03:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
jake berry from new futures
 
03:24:07.750 --> 03:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
he has handouts written testimony he
 
03:24:09.750 --> 03:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
wants to speak for two to three minutes
 
03:24:23.910 --> 03:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:25.590 --> 03:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's my mistake mr chairman i
 
03:24:27.269 --> 03:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
certainly meant to suggest that uh i
 
03:24:29.830 --> 03:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
meant to uh say that we opposed the bill
 
03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:30.870 align:start position:0%
meant to uh say that we opposed the bill
uh

03:24:30.870 --> 03:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:24:32.950 --> 03:24:32.960 align:start position:0%

behalf of new futures today but on
 
03:25:02.070 --> 03:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
thousands of people who feel they can't
 
03:25:04.229 --> 03:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
safely and securely access
 
03:25:05.830 --> 03:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
these hearings or proceedings today
 
03:25:08.389 --> 03:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
under the current pandemic
 
03:25:10.550 --> 03:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
to that and i have passed around uh
 
03:25:12.150 --> 03:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
testimony not only my own written
 
03:25:14.870 --> 03:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
testimony but testimony uh from
 
03:25:16.550 --> 03:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
several community members several public
 
03:25:18.389 --> 03:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
health professionals in opposition to
 
03:25:19.349 --> 03:25:19.359 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:25:21.429 --> 03:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh as well as several others before the
 
03:25:21.439 --> 03:25:22.389 align:start position:0%
uh as well as several others before the
committee

03:25:22.389 --> 03:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:25:23.670 --> 03:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
i don't want to repeat too much of
 
03:25:25.030 --> 03:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
what's been said here this morning but i
 
03:25:26.389 --> 03:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
do want to emphasize our strong
 
03:25:28.229 --> 03:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
03:25:30.229 --> 03:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
i simply put the state vaccine registry
 
03:25:32.150 --> 03:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
isn't it is a critical public health
 
03:25:34.710 --> 03:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
tool to get life-saving vaccines to
 
03:25:36.309 --> 03:25:36.319 align:start position:0%
individuals families and communities
 
03:25:37.990 --> 03:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
that need and want them
 
03:25:40.070 --> 03:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
i say public health tool because it
 
03:25:41.670 --> 03:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
helps to protect the health and safety
 
03:25:43.349 --> 03:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
of our entire state of our entire
 
03:25:46.950 --> 03:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
population especially children
 
03:25:49.349 --> 03:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
it's in place to help people access
 
03:25:51.349 --> 03:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
their vaccination records it helps them
 
03:25:53.590 --> 03:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
to it helps to identify any coverage
 
03:25:56.710 --> 03:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
gaps and reduce duplicative doses
 
03:25:58.870 --> 03:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
and it helps to generate reminders of
 
03:26:00.790 --> 03:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
any recall notices or
 
03:26:03.030 --> 03:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
needed reminders
 
03:26:04.469 --> 03:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
in short it helps to
 
03:26:06.309 --> 03:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
increase access to vaccines to those
 
03:26:07.590 --> 03:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
again who want them and those who need
 
03:26:07.600 --> 03:26:08.469 align:start position:0%
again who want them and those who need
them

03:26:08.469 --> 03:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:26:10.550 --> 03:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh and it only works the vaccine
 
03:26:12.550 --> 03:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
registry really only works when people
 
03:26:14.389 --> 03:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
participate as you've heard today to
 
03:26:17.429 --> 03:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
shift to an opt-in system would insert
 
03:26:19.349 --> 03:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily and harmful barriers to
 
03:26:19.359 --> 03:26:20.790 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily and harmful barriers to
participation

03:26:20.790 --> 03:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
participation
 
03:26:21.990 --> 03:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
this would limit the impact of the
 
03:26:24.150 --> 03:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
registry and would leave certain people
 
03:26:26.229 --> 03:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
more exposed to deadly to deadly
 
03:26:26.239 --> 03:26:27.990 align:start position:0%
more exposed to deadly to deadly
diseases

03:26:27.990 --> 03:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
03:26:31.030 --> 03:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
with that in mind we ask you to to
 
03:26:33.190 --> 03:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill by voting at itl and
 
03:26:34.870 --> 03:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
 
03:26:37.030 --> 03:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your uh brevity uh any
 
03:26:39.670 --> 03:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
questions mr barry
 
03:26:41.990 --> 03:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative king
 
03:26:43.990 --> 03:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:26:45.590 --> 03:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:26:47.830 --> 03:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused because this is
 
03:26:49.910 --> 03:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
about opt-in and yet
 
03:26:51.590 --> 03:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
as i'm going through the testimonies
 
03:26:53.429 --> 03:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
it's about
 
03:26:55.590 --> 03:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
requiring vaccinations and actually
 
03:26:57.830 --> 03:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
following vaccinations
 
03:26:59.429 --> 03:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if there's a disconnect
 
03:26:59.439 --> 03:27:00.710 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if there's a disconnect
here

03:27:00.710 --> 03:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:27:03.590 --> 03:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
certainly i i i the testimony is not
 
03:27:05.110 --> 03:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
intended to advocate for requiring
 
03:27:07.990 --> 03:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinations it is again intended to
 
03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:08.870 align:start position:0%
vaccinations it is again intended to
uh

03:27:08.870 --> 03:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:27:10.870 --> 03:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
or just to maintain the opt out system
 
03:27:12.630 --> 03:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
that we current have to encourage access
 
03:27:14.229 --> 03:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
to vaccinations again we're not talking
 
03:27:15.830 --> 03:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
about it requiring anybody but we do
 
03:27:17.590 --> 03:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
want to ensure that
 
03:27:19.670 --> 03:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
vaccinations are available to to those
 
03:27:23.429 --> 03:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:26.950 --> 03:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:28.469 --> 03:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
question is one who is myself paperwork
 
03:27:30.960 --> 03:27:32.150 align:start position:0%
question is one who is myself paperwork
challenged

03:27:32.150 --> 03:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
challenged
 
03:27:32.160 --> 03:27:33.750 align:start position:0%
challenged
um

03:27:33.750 --> 03:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:35.429 --> 03:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
is it
 
03:27:38.150 --> 03:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
not a concern
 
03:27:38.160 --> 03:27:39.269 align:start position:0%
not a concern
that

03:27:39.269 --> 03:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:27:40.870 --> 03:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
those people
 
03:27:43.910 --> 03:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
whose lives are more chaotic than others
 
03:27:46.389 --> 03:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
and who are more in need of various
 
03:27:48.550 --> 03:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
kinds of services
 
03:27:48.560 --> 03:27:49.349 align:start position:0%
kinds of services
are

03:27:49.349 --> 03:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:27:51.750 --> 03:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
precisely the people who might not be
 
03:27:54.950 --> 03:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
able to keep track themselves
 
03:27:57.110 --> 03:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
of vaccinations and other medical
 
03:27:57.120 --> 03:27:58.389 align:start position:0%
of vaccinations and other medical
records

03:27:58.389 --> 03:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
records
 
03:28:02.070 --> 03:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
and yet they are exactly the same sort
 
03:28:03.830 --> 03:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
of people who when faced with the
 
03:28:07.510 --> 03:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
paperwork requiring an opt-out
 
03:28:07.520 --> 03:28:08.389 align:start position:0%
paperwork requiring an opt-out
uh

03:28:08.389 --> 03:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:28:08.399 --> 03:28:09.670 align:start position:0%
uh
sorry

03:28:09.670 --> 03:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:28:11.510 --> 03:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
when faced with the sort of paperwork
 
03:28:14.070 --> 03:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
required for an opt-in each time a
 
03:28:15.990 --> 03:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine is given
 
03:28:18.710 --> 03:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
are going to have a hard time
 
03:28:20.710 --> 03:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
filling out that paperwork and making
 
03:28:23.269 --> 03:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
sure that their records get capped
 
03:28:26.950 --> 03:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
so thus making it harder for them
 
03:28:28.950 --> 03:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
03:28:31.269 --> 03:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
when they need the records
 
03:28:32.550 --> 03:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
certainly representative and thank you
 
03:28:34.630 --> 03:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
very much for the question um i think
 
03:28:35.990 --> 03:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
that certainly applies to me i can tell
 
03:28:38.150 --> 03:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
you i have a hard time sort of following
 
03:28:40.469 --> 03:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
my own vaccination records and i think
 
03:28:43.670 --> 03:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
that that absolutely does apply to
 
03:28:46.070 --> 03:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
many individuals uh you know those
 
03:28:47.910 --> 03:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
who we are uh uh you know very much
 
03:28:49.030 --> 03:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about those who face
 
03:28:51.190 --> 03:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic challenges who have
 
03:28:52.790 --> 03:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
complicated family lives at home
 
03:28:52.800 --> 03:28:53.830 align:start position:0%
complicated family lives at home
certainly

03:28:53.830 --> 03:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
03:28:55.510 --> 03:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
have a hard time uh
 
03:28:57.110 --> 03:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
maintaining their their own medical
 
03:28:58.469 --> 03:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
records and i think that this would
 
03:28:59.420 --> 03:28:59.430 align:start position:0%
certainly be uh
 
03:28:59.430 --> 03:29:00.630 align:start position:0%
certainly be uh
[Music]

03:29:00.630 --> 03:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:29:02.630 --> 03:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
additional challenges for them as well
 
03:29:04.630 --> 03:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:29:06.790 --> 03:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up
 
03:29:09.349 --> 03:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
are these people not also
 
03:29:12.790 --> 03:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
often folks who have to seek medical
 
03:29:12.800 --> 03:29:13.670 align:start position:0%
often folks who have to seek medical
care

03:29:13.670 --> 03:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:29:16.550 --> 03:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
in different locations different
 
03:29:19.429 --> 03:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
practices they are less likely
 
03:29:19.439 --> 03:29:21.110 align:start position:0%
practices they are less likely
than

03:29:21.110 --> 03:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
than
 
03:29:23.190 --> 03:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
maybe some others to have
 
03:29:24.950 --> 03:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
a primary care
 
03:29:28.309 --> 03:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
health care provider or a medical home
 
03:29:30.229 --> 03:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
of some kind where all of their records
 
03:29:32.550 --> 03:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
are centralized they may be getting they
 
03:29:34.630 --> 03:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
may be either moving from place to place
 
03:29:37.429 --> 03:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
or from clinic clinic in their pursuit
 
03:29:37.439 --> 03:29:38.150 align:start position:0%
or from clinic clinic in their pursuit
of

03:29:38.150 --> 03:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:29:39.590 --> 03:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh health care
 
03:29:41.030 --> 03:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
yes certainly once again thank you for
 
03:29:42.550 --> 03:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
the question representative uh some of
 
03:29:43.910 --> 03:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
these individuals were many of these
 
03:29:45.349 --> 03:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
individuals that we're talking about who
 
03:29:47.190 --> 03:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
face again these socioeconomic
 
03:29:49.030 --> 03:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
challenges and others are ones who face
 
03:29:51.030 --> 03:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh they experience many complicated
 
03:29:52.710 --> 03:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
medical conditions they have to you know
 
03:29:55.110 --> 03:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
they're having to see uh specialists
 
03:29:56.710 --> 03:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
they're having to uh
 
03:29:56.720 --> 03:29:57.429 align:start position:0%
they're having to uh
uh

03:29:57.429 --> 03:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:29:59.110 --> 03:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
go as you say different places see
 
03:30:00.630 --> 03:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
different people and again i think that
 
03:30:02.630 --> 03:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
adds to the complications and
 
03:30:02.640 --> 03:30:03.750 align:start position:0%
adds to the complications and
maintaining

03:30:03.750 --> 03:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
maintaining
 
03:30:05.190 --> 03:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
and organizing their own records and so
 
03:30:08.630 --> 03:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:12.469 --> 03:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:13.830 --> 03:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much for your
 
03:30:18.469 --> 03:30:18.479 align:start position:0%

opposition to hb 1606 which will change
 
03:31:03.030 --> 03:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
the current vaccines registries policy
 
03:31:04.229 --> 03:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
from out
 
03:31:06.469 --> 03:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
excuse me opt out to opt in by forcing
 
03:31:08.870 --> 03:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
patients and parents of children to opt
 
03:31:10.469 --> 03:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
into the program rather than allowing
 
03:31:12.630 --> 03:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
them to opt out as is the case under
 
03:31:13.990 --> 03:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
current law
 
03:31:14.950 --> 03:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
and i
 
03:31:17.830 --> 03:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize the child health
 
03:31:20.070 --> 03:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
mission that we're all on here you know
 
03:31:21.910 --> 03:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's not just our experience as adults
 
03:31:24.469 --> 03:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
with vaccinations and our responsibility
 
03:31:26.630 --> 03:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
to protect the children of new hampshire
 
03:31:28.469 --> 03:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
the registry was designed with multiple
 
03:31:30.550 --> 03:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
security protocols so all patient
 
03:31:32.950 --> 03:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
information is private and secure this
 
03:31:34.790 --> 03:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
information is protected by hipaa which
 
03:31:36.790 --> 03:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
means the information cannot be accessed
 
03:31:38.870 --> 03:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
by anyone except your health care
 
03:31:41.190 --> 03:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
providers plus these providers must
 
03:31:42.630 --> 03:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
complete a training before they are
 
03:31:45.110 --> 03:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
given access to the system to ensure
 
03:31:47.429 --> 03:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
they understand how to use a system and
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
how to keep your information secure the
 
03:31:51.990 --> 03:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
registry uses the same security measures
 
03:31:53.990 --> 03:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
as other electronic medical records you
 
03:31:55.030 --> 03:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
may have
 
03:31:57.429 --> 03:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
and i consulted with
 
03:31:57.439 --> 03:31:58.550 align:start position:0%
and i consulted with
the

03:31:58.550 --> 03:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:32:00.389 --> 03:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
association of school nurses to find out
 
03:32:01.830 --> 03:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
what that training was about and they
 
03:32:03.590 --> 03:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
provided me a lot of information on that
 
03:32:05.110 --> 03:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
particular statement
 
03:32:06.710 --> 03:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is the last state in the
 
03:32:09.269 --> 03:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
country to implement a vaccine registry
 
03:32:11.190 --> 03:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
after years of planning the rollout of
 
03:32:13.190 --> 03:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
the immunization information system
 
03:32:15.190 --> 03:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
coincided with the pandemic
 
03:32:17.030 --> 03:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
in spite of this providers have been
 
03:32:19.429 --> 03:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
uploading immunizations into the system
 
03:32:21.030 --> 03:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
since last april
 
03:32:22.870 --> 03:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
under an opt-in model they would have to
 
03:32:24.710 --> 03:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
get signed permission from each patient
 
03:32:27.349 --> 03:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
for each immunization it slows down the
 
03:32:29.269 --> 03:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
process tremendously creating extra
 
03:32:31.670 --> 03:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
paperwork and red tape for families and
 
03:32:34.150 --> 03:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
busy clinicians changing the program to
 
03:32:36.389 --> 03:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
opt in would only slow down the progress
 
03:32:38.389 --> 03:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
that has been made and does nothing to
 
03:32:41.030 --> 03:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
protect individual rights it is a very
 
03:32:42.870 --> 03:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
small percentage of parents who choose
 
03:32:44.150 --> 03:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
to opt out
 
03:32:45.990 --> 03:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
as an example of the value of state
 
03:32:48.550 --> 03:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
registry vaccines excuse me state
 
03:32:51.030 --> 03:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine registries i will briefly share
 
03:32:53.030 --> 03:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
with you the following information
 
03:32:55.830 --> 03:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
in 2010 63 confirmed measles cases were
 
03:33:00.070 --> 03:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
reported to the cdc by 2019 1282 cases
 
03:33:02.790 --> 03:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
of measles were confirmed in 31 states
 
03:33:04.469 --> 03:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
that was the greatest number of cases in
 
03:33:07.550 --> 03:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
the us since 1992. of the
 
03:33:10.630 --> 03:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
1282-128 needed hospitalization 61 had
 
03:33:12.870 --> 03:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
complications such as pneumonia and
 
03:33:15.670 --> 03:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
encephalitis it was the state's vaccine
 
03:33:17.510 --> 03:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
registries that provided data and
 
03:33:19.510 --> 03:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
support to the public and private sector
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
efforts to protect their populations and
 
03:33:24.150 --> 03:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
limit contagion the current opt-out
 
03:33:25.750 --> 03:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
status of the new hampshire registry
 
03:33:27.750 --> 03:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
allows families an easy way to choose
 
03:33:29.190 --> 03:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
not to participate
 
03:33:31.110 --> 03:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
ensuring optimization of the registry
 
03:33:33.269 --> 03:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
which is designed by the cdc as a best
 
03:33:33.279 --> 03:33:34.309 align:start position:0%
which is designed by the cdc as a best
practice

03:33:34.309 --> 03:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
practice
 
03:33:36.870 --> 03:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
hb 1606 would weaken new hampshire's
 
03:33:39.510 --> 03:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
newly established vaccine registry a
 
03:33:41.590 --> 03:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
critical tool in increasing vaccination
 
03:33:44.389 --> 03:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
rates and combating infectious disease
 
03:33:47.269 --> 03:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
in conclusion the nha is asking this
 
03:33:49.670 --> 03:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
committee to vote this bill inexpedient
 
03:33:50.950 --> 03:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
03:33:52.550 --> 03:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and service to
 
03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire thank you
 
03:33:56.790 --> 03:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
very much and for your time management
 
03:33:59.269 --> 03:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
as well i think that's something nurses
 
03:34:02.389 --> 03:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
know a question from representative
 
03:34:02.399 --> 03:34:06.870 align:start position:0%
know a question from representative
delemus

03:34:06.870 --> 03:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:08.710 --> 03:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:34:12.469 --> 03:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:16.070 --> 03:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
i obviously must be missing something
 
03:34:19.670 --> 03:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
what why isn't the um opt out
 
03:34:21.590 --> 03:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
option offered every time there's a
 
03:34:21.600 --> 03:34:23.830 align:start position:0%
option offered every time there's a
vaccination

03:34:23.830 --> 03:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
03:34:27.510 --> 03:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
pardon me why why isn't the opt out
 
03:34:27.520 --> 03:34:28.389 align:start position:0%
pardon me why why isn't the opt out
option

03:34:28.389 --> 03:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
option
 
03:34:28.399 --> 03:34:29.670 align:start position:0%
option
offered

03:34:29.670 --> 03:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
offered
 
03:34:32.469 --> 03:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
every time there's a vaccination
 
03:34:34.150 --> 03:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i understand what you mean
 
03:34:36.469 --> 03:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
well i've been i've been listening and
 
03:34:39.110 --> 03:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
and i hear that the opt-out is offered
 
03:34:41.670 --> 03:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
once and then you're automatically in
 
03:34:41.680 --> 03:34:42.469 align:start position:0%
once and then you're automatically in
the

03:34:42.469 --> 03:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:34:44.469 --> 03:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
opt out
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
category you put in that
 
03:34:47.040 --> 03:34:48.229 align:start position:0%
category you put in that
that

03:34:48.229 --> 03:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:34:48.239 --> 03:34:49.510 align:start position:0%
that
group

03:34:49.510 --> 03:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
group
 
03:34:52.389 --> 03:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
why why is that why why isn't the opt
 
03:34:52.399 --> 03:34:53.349 align:start position:0%
why why is that why why isn't the opt
out

03:34:53.349 --> 03:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:34:56.870 --> 03:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
option offered every time that there is
 
03:34:58.630 --> 03:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
a vaccination
 
03:35:01.110 --> 03:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'm really not clear and um or prepared
 
03:35:02.790 --> 03:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
to answer that question
 
03:35:05.030 --> 03:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
it must be
 
03:35:05.040 --> 03:35:05.910 align:start position:0%
it must be
okay

03:35:05.910 --> 03:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:35:07.830 --> 03:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
well i can can i have another question
 
03:35:11.830 --> 03:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
yeah you try again thank you i'm sorry
 
03:35:14.150 --> 03:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
if the if the opt out
 
03:35:17.030 --> 03:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
option isn't offered every time that
 
03:35:20.710 --> 03:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
there's a vaccination administered
 
03:35:23.510 --> 03:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't wouldn't that actually add to
 
03:35:24.469 --> 03:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
the small
 
03:35:24.479 --> 03:35:25.510 align:start position:0%
the small
numbers

03:35:25.510 --> 03:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
03:35:25.520 --> 03:35:26.389 align:start position:0%
numbers
of

03:35:26.389 --> 03:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:35:29.190 --> 03:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
you've got these this registry and
 
03:35:30.469 --> 03:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
you're saying that there are a lot of
 
03:35:33.030 --> 03:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
people who are not
 
03:35:35.910 --> 03:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
opting out but if you're not offering
 
03:35:38.710 --> 03:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
opt-out and they people are unaware that
 
03:35:40.950 --> 03:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
there's the option of opting out
 
03:35:44.229 --> 03:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that add to the small numbers
 
03:35:47.030 --> 03:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead go ahead yeah possibly you know
 
03:35:49.429 --> 03:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
i can't really predict the future but
 
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
what i feel is that you know to
 
03:35:55.110 --> 03:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
expedient to make the estate registries
 
03:35:57.990 --> 03:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
a useful tool an accurate tool that we
 
03:35:59.910 --> 03:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
can base decisions on protecting the
 
03:36:01.349 --> 03:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
public you have to have the most
 
03:36:03.429 --> 03:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
participation possible i don't think
 
03:36:05.590 --> 03:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
anyone was malignantly in
 
03:36:07.990 --> 03:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
intended to deprive people of their
 
03:36:12.229 --> 03:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:13.830 --> 03:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:36:17.429 --> 03:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:19.510 --> 03:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
 
03:36:21.670 --> 03:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:36:24.229 --> 03:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
question um i do want to point out
 
03:36:26.309 --> 03:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
because you did say in your testimony
 
03:36:28.870 --> 03:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
that the law states that it's an opt-out
 
03:36:30.469 --> 03:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
program and that's not true it doesn't
 
03:36:32.070 --> 03:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
say that anywhere
 
03:36:34.150 --> 03:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
but i would like to know um how
 
03:36:34.160 --> 03:36:35.510 align:start position:0%
but i would like to know um how
specifically

03:36:35.510 --> 03:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:36:38.229 --> 03:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
would we use this data in the event of
 
03:36:40.550 --> 03:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
an outbreak would we then target people
 
03:36:44.710 --> 03:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
who are unvaccinated and you know go
 
03:36:45.750 --> 03:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:36:47.750 --> 03:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
try to tell them door-to-door and tell
 
03:36:49.910 --> 03:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
them that they need to be
 
03:36:51.670 --> 03:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
i would leave that to the public health
 
03:36:53.349 --> 03:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
in this state to answer you know the
 
03:36:55.269 --> 03:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
mechanics of that but right now if you
 
03:36:57.910 --> 03:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
have access to good accurate data
 
03:36:59.510 --> 03:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know which the registries did
 
03:37:02.309 --> 03:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
provide they were able to strategize and
 
03:37:05.190 --> 03:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
you know isolate populations notify
 
03:37:07.110 --> 03:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
practices that may have had more people
 
03:37:09.590 --> 03:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
at risk and this tool i think would be
 
03:37:16.469 --> 03:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:18.070 --> 03:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you so
 
03:37:19.670 --> 03:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
much for coming for your testimony and
 
03:37:22.550 --> 03:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:24.229 --> 03:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
and dr eric
 
03:37:25.750 --> 03:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to look at the second letter
 
03:37:33.990 --> 03:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:35.990 --> 03:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
my wife's a doctor she writes well he's
 
03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
he's not bad there's just one letter and
 
03:37:39.670 --> 03:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
that's my eyesight actually
 
03:37:41.110 --> 03:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
somebody else filled up the card for me
 
03:37:43.429 --> 03:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
so that isn't my writing
 
03:37:45.110 --> 03:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
so it is possible you might not be able
 
03:37:49.429 --> 03:37:49.439 align:start position:0%

and in bedford
 
03:38:01.429 --> 03:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:03.269 --> 03:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely i'm dr eric sessler i'm a
 
03:38:04.630 --> 03:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
practicing pediatrician general
 
03:38:05.990 --> 03:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
pediatrician in manchester and in
 
03:38:07.830 --> 03:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
bedford i'm the current president of the
 
03:38:09.269 --> 03:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
american academy of pediatrics new
 
03:38:10.630 --> 03:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire chapter
 
03:38:12.070 --> 03:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm also speaking on behalf of the
 
03:38:13.750 --> 03:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire medical society and i'm
 
03:38:15.590 --> 03:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
going to ask the person at the table
 
03:38:18.950 --> 03:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
also to fill out a pink card please
 
03:38:21.269 --> 03:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
we could absolutely do that
 
03:38:27.269 --> 03:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:28.870 --> 03:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
so while she's filling that out i'll be
 
03:38:31.269 --> 03:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
able to kind of go first briefly so
 
03:38:33.269 --> 03:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
vaccine registries are an important tool
 
03:38:35.030 --> 03:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
for us as medical professionals to be
 
03:38:36.389 --> 03:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
able to help out with the care that
 
03:38:38.469 --> 03:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
we're doing as it's been stated before
 
03:38:40.389 --> 03:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
we're the last state um in the us and
 
03:38:42.150 --> 03:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
district columbia to be able to set one
 
03:38:42.160 --> 03:38:43.189 align:start position:0%
district columbia to be able to set one
up

03:38:43.189 --> 03:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:38:45.830 --> 03:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
and so the opt out is an important part
 
03:38:47.110 --> 03:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
of that to make sure that we actually
 
03:38:49.590 --> 03:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
have that tool be as robust and useful
 
03:38:51.349 --> 03:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
as we can and it's a tool that's
 
03:38:53.830 --> 03:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
important both for families with regards
 
03:38:55.269 --> 03:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
to the organization stuff that we've
 
03:38:57.110 --> 03:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
talked about previously as well as
 
03:38:58.550 --> 03:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
medical professionals so that we're more
 
03:39:00.150 --> 03:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
likely to have the information that we
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
need at the time to make the best
 
03:39:03.990 --> 03:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
decisions for the care of our patients
 
03:39:05.510 --> 03:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
and for the families
 
03:39:07.030 --> 03:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
and so for those reasons that's why we
 
03:39:08.550 --> 03:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
noticed that these are most effective
 
03:39:10.710 --> 03:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
for us as a setup as a practicing
 
03:39:12.070 --> 03:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
pediatrician i will be able to tell you
 
03:39:15.189 --> 03:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
that we do talk about opt out every
 
03:39:17.590 --> 03:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
single time we give a vaccine
 
03:39:19.349 --> 03:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
and so we have that you know discussion
 
03:39:21.030 --> 03:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
with families the forms are sitting in
 
03:39:23.030 --> 03:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
our offices available for families to be
 
03:39:25.510 --> 03:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
able to sign so our rooming staff for
 
03:39:27.429 --> 03:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
example will bring it up as part of that
 
03:39:30.309 --> 03:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
initial piece johnny's eligible for
 
03:39:32.630 --> 03:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine x y and z
 
03:39:34.309 --> 03:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
we are now registering or where now
 
03:39:35.830 --> 03:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
there is now a vaccine registry within
 
03:39:37.110 --> 03:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
the state if you would like to be able
 
03:39:39.269 --> 03:39:39.279 align:start position:0%
to opt out we have that as a scenario
 
03:39:41.030 --> 03:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
the rooming staff will then talk to me
 
03:39:42.710 --> 03:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
for example i'll answer the family's
 
03:39:43.910 --> 03:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
questions and we have the form right
 
03:39:45.189 --> 03:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
there that they can fill out as a
 
03:39:45.199 --> 03:39:46.309 align:start position:0%
there that they can fill out as a
process

03:39:46.309 --> 03:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:39:47.670 --> 03:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
it did come up previously that there
 
03:39:49.830 --> 03:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
were pediatricians that that mentioned
 
03:39:52.229 --> 03:39:52.239 align:start position:0%
about the registering being difficult
 
03:39:53.590 --> 03:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
that actually is more the ordering
 
03:39:55.510 --> 03:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
system and the fact that there isn't a
 
03:39:57.110 --> 03:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
computer interface yet between the
 
03:39:59.110 --> 03:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
registry and the form not because
 
03:40:00.710 --> 03:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
actually the process is that difficult
 
03:40:02.150 --> 03:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's that we're still working on the
 
03:40:04.309 --> 03:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
electronic interface and that's actually
 
03:40:05.590 --> 03:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
what's causing a lot of pediatric
 
03:40:07.189 --> 03:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
practices difficulty with regards to
 
03:40:10.630 --> 03:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:12.630 --> 03:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
so in the interest of time i wanted to
 
03:40:12.640 --> 03:40:13.990 align:start position:0%
so in the interest of time i wanted to
express

03:40:13.990 --> 03:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
express
 
03:40:16.150 --> 03:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
why i personally think that the vaccine
 
03:40:18.950 --> 03:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
registry is vital to medical care not
 
03:40:20.950 --> 03:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
only on the primary care level but also
 
03:40:22.950 --> 03:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
on the critical care level
 
03:40:25.269 --> 03:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
i recently this past weekend working a
 
03:40:28.870 --> 03:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
24-hour shift had a patient come in who
 
03:40:30.309 --> 03:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
essentially came in for an asthma
 
03:40:30.319 --> 03:40:31.990 align:start position:0%
essentially came in for an asthma
exacerbation

03:40:31.990 --> 03:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
exacerbation
 
03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:33.269 align:start position:0%
exacerbation
their

03:40:33.269 --> 03:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:40:34.950 --> 03:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
their care was initially just
 
03:40:37.189 --> 03:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
transferred to our practice actually and
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
we had no records of their vaccination
 
03:40:41.830 --> 03:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
status considering that they had most of
 
03:40:43.830 --> 03:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
their vaccines prior
 
03:40:45.670 --> 03:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
to the initiation of our vaccine
 
03:40:48.150 --> 03:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
registry not only did this complicate
 
03:40:51.269 --> 03:40:51.279 align:start position:0%
kind of our management style but it also
 
03:40:53.510 --> 03:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
led to kind of unnecessary
 
03:40:55.510 --> 03:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
testing and other kind of medical
 
03:40:57.670 --> 03:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
considerations given that we did not
 
03:40:59.990 --> 03:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
have these records at hand and i think
 
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
the important part here is that care
 
03:41:04.229 --> 03:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
management does not change unless
 
03:41:06.389 --> 03:41:06.399 align:start position:0%
there's a big kind of consideration to
 
03:41:08.710 --> 03:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
make and without these records and this
 
03:41:10.630 --> 03:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
being complete records it made a
 
03:41:13.429 --> 03:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
severely significant kind of change in
 
03:41:15.110 --> 03:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
our medical management and that is not
 
03:41:16.710 --> 03:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
something that we take lightly
 
03:41:16.720 --> 03:41:18.150 align:start position:0%
something that we take lightly
necessarily

03:41:18.150 --> 03:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
03:41:19.910 --> 03:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
so i think this speaks links to how the
 
03:41:21.910 --> 03:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry can be critical to our
 
03:41:23.990 --> 03:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
management style itself
 
03:41:26.710 --> 03:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
as having these records complete will
 
03:41:30.469 --> 03:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:31.590 --> 03:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and i just wanted to add one
 
03:41:33.830 --> 03:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
other quick story our families who move
 
03:41:35.990 --> 03:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
from state to state are surprised that
 
03:41:37.510 --> 03:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire doesn't have a functioning
 
03:41:39.189 --> 03:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry it comes up on a
 
03:41:41.030 --> 03:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
regular basis for us with regards to
 
03:41:42.630 --> 03:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
families who struggle to get the records
 
03:41:44.550 --> 03:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
that they would like for the care that
 
03:41:46.229 --> 03:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
they would need and i want to be able to
 
03:41:47.670 --> 03:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that i can make that first
 
03:41:50.469 --> 03:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
visit as effective as i possibly can
 
03:41:51.590 --> 03:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
and when we don't always have that
 
03:41:52.870 --> 03:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
records it's actually quite difficult
 
03:41:54.309 --> 03:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately we've all had the
 
03:41:56.389 --> 03:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
experience where trying to get records
 
03:41:57.910 --> 03:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
from various different health systems
 
03:41:59.590 --> 03:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't go as smoothly as you might like
 
03:42:00.469 --> 03:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
it to
 
03:42:02.389 --> 03:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
and having a vaccine registry makes it a
 
03:42:04.870 --> 03:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
much smoother process for us to be able
 
03:42:06.150 --> 03:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
to get all the records that we need for
 
03:42:07.510 --> 03:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
families to have the records that they
 
03:42:07.520 --> 03:42:08.309 align:start position:0%
families to have the records that they
need

03:42:08.309 --> 03:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:42:10.469 --> 03:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
at their fingertips
 
03:42:12.429 --> 03:42:12.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:42:12.439 --> 03:42:14.150 align:start position:0%
thank you

weber

03:42:16.950 --> 03:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:21.030 --> 03:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and um
 
03:42:23.990 --> 03:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
doctor i'm sorry the pediatric resident
 
03:42:26.469 --> 03:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
i didn't get your name properly but
 
03:42:29.429 --> 03:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
could you detail for us some of the
 
03:42:29.439 --> 03:42:30.389 align:start position:0%
could you detail for us some of the
medical

03:42:30.389 --> 03:42:30.399 align:start position:0%
medical
 
03:42:33.670 --> 03:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
interventions that you were required
 
03:42:36.150 --> 03:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
that you felt were necessary because you
 
03:42:39.349 --> 03:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
did not have vaccination records
 
03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
available to us what what was
 
03:42:45.269 --> 03:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
the consequences for the patient
 
03:42:50.790 --> 03:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:53.830 --> 03:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
so i think um otherwise speaking
 
03:42:57.110 --> 03:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
it would it would really or result in
 
03:42:59.590 --> 03:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
extra testing particularly to make sure
 
03:43:01.990 --> 03:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
that our patients if they do have these
 
03:43:04.870 --> 03:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines on borders or not
 
03:43:06.870 --> 03:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
other considerations would be medication
 
03:43:08.150 --> 03:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
management changing what kind of
 
03:43:09.670 --> 03:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
medications we might need to treat these
 
03:43:11.110 --> 03:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
patients with
 
03:43:12.630 --> 03:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:43:14.550 --> 03:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
apologies the whisper was just to remind
 
03:43:15.670 --> 03:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
her to be careful with private
 
03:43:17.030 --> 03:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
information with regards to how we
 
03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%

representative leon
 
03:43:27.349 --> 03:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you both
 
03:43:29.910 --> 03:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
for being here today um i
 
03:43:33.030 --> 03:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
have a two-part question the first is it
 
03:43:34.790 --> 03:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
sounds like a lot of families see the
 
03:43:37.349 --> 03:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
value and i'm curious if making it
 
03:43:38.950 --> 03:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
opt-in would be a burden to those
 
03:43:41.429 --> 03:43:41.439 align:start position:0%
families who want this system and then
 
03:43:43.349 --> 03:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
the second part of my question is i had
 
03:43:45.750 --> 03:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
to go to the emergency room with my
 
03:43:47.750 --> 03:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
very young child when we were unable to
 
03:43:49.189 --> 03:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
get into the doctor for any of the
 
03:43:49.199 --> 03:43:50.550 align:start position:0%
get into the doctor for any of the
immunizations

03:43:50.550 --> 03:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
immunizations
 
03:43:52.630 --> 03:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
before that visit so we were stuck in
 
03:43:54.469 --> 03:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
the ambulance bay as bit of an airlock
 
03:43:56.790 --> 03:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
chamber and they just they just did all
 
03:43:59.830 --> 03:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
those different diagnoses if that is
 
03:44:01.590 --> 03:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
a risk that a family is willing to take
 
03:44:03.349 --> 03:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
if their information isn't in there
 
03:44:05.590 --> 03:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
because they choose not to opt in
 
03:44:09.990 --> 03:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:11.670 --> 03:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
i guess the question is
 
03:44:13.030 --> 03:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
that that's just the consequence of
 
03:44:15.830 --> 03:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
somebody choosing not to opt in
 
03:44:17.110 --> 03:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
03:44:19.030 --> 03:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative um so i'm gonna start
 
03:44:20.469 --> 03:44:20.479 align:start position:0%
with the second one and then go back i
 
03:44:21.830 --> 03:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
may need a quick reminder on the first
 
03:44:24.150 --> 03:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
question but the second uh piece is that
 
03:44:25.510 --> 03:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
families should always have the right to
 
03:44:27.590 --> 03:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
be able to refuse a vaccine and that
 
03:44:29.349 --> 03:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
happens with regards to my conversations
 
03:44:31.030 --> 03:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
with families on a regular basis as well
 
03:44:33.110 --> 03:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
as the vaccine registry so i'll often
 
03:44:35.189 --> 03:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
talk to families about the idea that you
 
03:44:37.110 --> 03:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
know you're advocating for your child if
 
03:44:38.630 --> 03:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
you choose and not to vaccinate that is
 
03:44:39.990 --> 03:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
completely your right to be able to
 
03:44:41.910 --> 03:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
choose that i just remind families just
 
03:44:43.189 --> 03:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
make sure you tell the medical
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
professionals you're working with in the
 
03:44:46.870 --> 03:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
emergency room or any other sessions so
 
03:44:48.630 --> 03:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
that they can have that consideration in
 
03:44:51.110 --> 03:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
mind in case it were to alter care
 
03:44:52.710 --> 03:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
with regards to the decisions that you
 
03:44:55.030 --> 03:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
might make and it might have to do with
 
03:44:57.030 --> 03:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
if a child has a fever in the emergency
 
03:45:00.389 --> 03:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
room the list of things that it could be
 
03:45:02.229 --> 03:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
is different if you've had the different
 
03:45:04.229 --> 03:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccines versus if you hadn't
 
03:45:05.750 --> 03:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
so absolutely that's a family's right to
 
03:45:07.590 --> 03:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
make that decision and so it's important
 
03:45:08.870 --> 03:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
that there should be an ability for
 
03:45:10.630 --> 03:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
folks to not be in that registry if they
 
03:45:12.389 --> 03:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
would choose not to be
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
and that's why we want to make sure we
 
03:45:14.790 --> 03:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
have that option and i apologize what
 
03:45:17.189 --> 03:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
was the first question again mine well
 
03:45:19.590 --> 03:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
my baby was unvaccinated just because of
 
03:45:22.070 --> 03:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
when he was born thanks to carvid
 
03:45:24.630 --> 03:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
but this first question was you have so
 
03:45:26.229 --> 03:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
many families that want to have this
 
03:45:28.790 --> 03:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
information in a database is having to
 
03:45:31.110 --> 03:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
just check a box and say i opt in an
 
03:45:32.790 --> 03:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
undue burden for them
 
03:45:34.710 --> 03:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
um it's not necessarily a burden for
 
03:45:36.389 --> 03:45:36.399 align:start position:0%
them as the piece of from a family
 
03:45:38.389 --> 03:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
perspective the vaccine registry still
 
03:45:40.630 --> 03:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
functions as far as an opt-in with
 
03:45:43.110 --> 03:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
regards to an individual family the
 
03:45:44.870 --> 03:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
problem becomes is how well it works
 
03:45:46.550 --> 03:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about the aggregate
 
03:45:48.309 --> 03:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
data in general
 
03:45:51.030 --> 03:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
so for example as a provider
 
03:45:52.950 --> 03:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
when you're creating that initial opt-in
 
03:45:54.309 --> 03:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
you don't know what's going to happen to
 
03:45:55.750 --> 03:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
you down the line with regards to if
 
03:45:56.950 --> 03:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
you're in an emergency room and you
 
03:45:58.710 --> 03:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
can't have the records at the fingertips
 
03:46:00.469 --> 03:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
at the times that you necessarily want
 
03:46:03.349 --> 03:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
it so the opt-out process allows us to
 
03:46:05.750 --> 03:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
have a much more effective tool
 
03:46:07.510 --> 03:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
as a whole with we've got more families
 
03:46:08.710 --> 03:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
involved because again there's the vast
 
03:46:10.469 --> 03:46:10.479 align:start position:0%
majority of families will choose to opt
 
03:46:13.590 --> 03:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:15.349 --> 03:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
i would like to say from the resident
 
03:46:17.910 --> 03:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
perspective the logistics of kind of
 
03:46:19.429 --> 03:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
working through that
 
03:46:22.790 --> 03:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
often comes at the um
 
03:46:25.189 --> 03:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
at the expense of our time so it might
 
03:46:27.910 --> 03:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
help it might delay care
 
03:46:32.309 --> 03:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:35.590 --> 03:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:37.269 --> 03:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:46:38.880 --> 03:46:39.910 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

03:46:39.910 --> 03:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:42.070 --> 03:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing from at least i think i'm
 
03:46:44.790 --> 03:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
hearing from you as pediatricians
 
03:46:49.349 --> 03:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
is you're concentrating on just those
 
03:46:49.359 --> 03:46:50.389 align:start position:0%
is you're concentrating on just those
immunizations

03:46:50.389 --> 03:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
immunizations
 
03:46:51.750 --> 03:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
that are given
 
03:46:55.189 --> 03:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
to children and are required for school
 
03:46:57.349 --> 03:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
and things like that
 
03:47:00.750 --> 03:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
you're not necessarily speaking to
 
03:47:03.830 --> 03:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
immunizations that people can choose to
 
03:47:03.840 --> 03:47:04.630 align:start position:0%
immunizations that people can choose to
have

03:47:04.630 --> 03:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:47:07.030 --> 03:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
or not have later in in
 
03:47:09.830 --> 03:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
as they get older
 
03:47:11.189 --> 03:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
for the most part i thank you for your
 
03:47:12.389 --> 03:47:12.399 align:start position:0%
question you're correct because in this
 
03:47:14.309 --> 03:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
case the vaccine registry is focused on
 
03:47:16.790 --> 03:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
the state-supplied vaccines so depending
 
03:47:17.990 --> 03:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
on which age range we're talking about
 
03:47:19.189 --> 03:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
at which vaccines we're talking about
 
03:47:20.950 --> 03:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
not all of them end up being supplied in
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
the same way
 
03:47:23.990 --> 03:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
so yes the majority of these the vaccine
 
03:47:25.990 --> 03:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
registries historically were started
 
03:47:27.910 --> 03:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
back in the late 90s
 
03:47:29.830 --> 03:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
and the early 2000s across the the
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
country were for the school documented
 
03:47:34.710 --> 03:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines so with regards to the
 
03:47:36.550 --> 03:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
conversation before schools day cares
 
03:47:39.429 --> 03:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:40.710 --> 03:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:47:42.389 --> 03:47:42.399 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
03:47:44.950 --> 03:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
most of these were set up just to follow
 
03:47:47.349 --> 03:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
those childhood vaccines
 
03:47:51.110 --> 03:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
um adding in now the the covid19 people
 
03:47:53.670 --> 03:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
that have gotten their immunizations
 
03:47:56.150 --> 03:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't necessarily the original intent
 
03:47:58.150 --> 03:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
of these registries
 
03:48:00.070 --> 03:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
that is correct these uh the registries
 
03:48:01.830 --> 03:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
were set up as an idea
 
03:48:03.110 --> 03:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
essentially before and even in new
 
03:48:04.790 --> 03:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire this first came up basically
 
03:48:07.189 --> 03:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
long before covid is with regards to
 
03:48:08.870 --> 03:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
being a useful tool for us as healthcare
 
03:48:12.950 --> 03:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:14.309 --> 03:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
we would like the cove i mean the more
 
03:48:16.309 --> 03:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
information in the tool the better but
 
03:48:18.150 --> 03:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
with regards to vaccines but it was set
 
03:48:20.150 --> 03:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
up not with regards to covenant 19 in
 
03:48:20.160 --> 03:48:23.670 align:start position:0%
up not with regards to covenant 19 in
mind

03:48:23.670 --> 03:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:24.950 --> 03:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:48:26.870 --> 03:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
03:48:28.389 --> 03:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
you raised a
 
03:48:32.150 --> 03:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
point about the pain point being
 
03:48:34.550 --> 03:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
the ordering side more than the
 
03:48:36.790 --> 03:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
registry itself
 
03:48:39.189 --> 03:48:39.199 align:start position:0%
can you speak to or someone can speak to
 
03:48:41.189 --> 03:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
is the data that goes in when you
 
03:48:43.269 --> 03:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
register the vaccine
 
03:48:45.189 --> 03:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
used on the ordering side in other words
 
03:48:47.590 --> 03:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
if you don't put the ordering
 
03:48:50.950 --> 03:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
the vaccine into the information system
 
03:48:52.870 --> 03:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
it won't have that data to order a
 
03:48:54.550 --> 03:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
replacement vaccine can you kind of
 
03:48:55.910 --> 03:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
speak to that do you have that knowledge
 
03:48:57.830 --> 03:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
to help me understand this i i thank you
 
03:48:59.030 --> 03:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
very much for your question i do have
 
03:49:00.309 --> 03:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
some of that knowledge and can give a
 
03:49:02.309 --> 03:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
little bit of shed light on that so is
 
03:49:05.110 --> 03:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
from a practice perspective those two
 
03:49:08.389 --> 03:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
systems work hand in hand in that i have
 
03:49:10.870 --> 03:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
to supply the state either kind of the
 
03:49:13.189 --> 03:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
data within the vaccine registry or an
 
03:49:13.199 --> 03:49:14.389 align:start position:0%
data within the vaccine registry or an
opt-out

03:49:14.389 --> 03:49:14.399 align:start position:0%
opt-out
 
03:49:16.229 --> 03:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
with regards to this is how much vaccine
 
03:49:17.189 --> 03:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
i need
 
03:49:18.630 --> 03:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
and so the state doesn't necessarily
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
know which families opt out they just
 
03:49:22.150 --> 03:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
have the information that i did one of
 
03:49:23.910 --> 03:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
two things i either supplied the
 
03:49:25.030 --> 03:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
information as part of the vaccine
 
03:49:27.429 --> 03:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
registry or gave them an opt-out form
 
03:49:29.429 --> 03:49:29.439 align:start position:0%
for the families that chose to opt out
 
03:49:31.429 --> 03:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
and that's how much vaccine i used
 
03:49:32.870 --> 03:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
during and so it's part of the tracking
 
03:49:34.550 --> 03:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
system from that standpoint
 
03:49:36.150 --> 03:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
so the difficulty we're having is the
 
03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
documentation is it has to be all by
 
03:49:40.870 --> 03:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
hand so someone from our staff has to
 
03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
actually enter in that data because
 
03:49:44.469 --> 03:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
we're still working on with the state on
 
03:49:45.830 --> 03:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
making sure that there's an electronic
 
03:49:47.750 --> 03:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
interface so that my electronic medical
 
03:49:50.870 --> 03:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
record will supply the data needed with
 
03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
button push as opposed to manually
 
03:49:54.150 --> 03:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
entering that's actually been the
 
03:49:56.469 --> 03:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
difficulty not that the system itself
 
03:49:58.229 --> 03:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
the registry is difficult
 
03:49:59.510 --> 03:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
and it's a hurdle that all the states
 
03:50:00.790 --> 03:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
have had to go through with regards to
 
03:50:02.950 --> 03:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
like electronic medical records but
 
03:50:04.070 --> 03:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's the part we're still working and
 
03:50:07.590 --> 03:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
that's where it's been difficult
 
03:50:09.510 --> 03:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
anything further uh representative
 
03:50:09.520 --> 03:50:10.550 align:start position:0%
anything further uh representative

03:50:11.990 --> 03:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:50:14.309 --> 03:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question so i i just keep
 
03:50:16.309 --> 03:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
hearing the the argument that um there
 
03:50:17.750 --> 03:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
will be lower participation in the
 
03:50:19.510 --> 03:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
registry and we won't have as much data
 
03:50:23.030 --> 03:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
if it's an opt-in but if the opt-out is
 
03:50:23.040 --> 03:50:23.830 align:start position:0%
if it's an opt-in but if the opt-out is
being

03:50:23.830 --> 03:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
being
 
03:50:25.670 --> 03:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for an opt-out is being
 
03:50:27.590 --> 03:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
provided as it's required by law
 
03:50:31.910 --> 03:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:34.070 --> 03:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
when we think about vaccines in general
 
03:50:35.269 --> 03:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
i apologize thank you very much for the
 
03:50:37.189 --> 03:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
question when we think about vaccine
 
03:50:38.870 --> 03:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
processes in general
 
03:50:41.189 --> 03:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
the presumptive approach that that
 
03:50:42.870 --> 03:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
someone is going to be able to do a
 
03:50:44.389 --> 03:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine so i apologize i'm going to use
 
03:50:46.630 --> 03:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
the example of a vaccine a family that's
 
03:50:48.790 --> 03:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
uncertain about doing a vaccine if i
 
03:50:51.910 --> 03:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
present the choice to a family as a
 
03:50:54.790 --> 03:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
you your billy is due for these vaccines
 
03:50:55.910 --> 03:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
for today
 
03:50:58.150 --> 03:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
is different than would you like to do
 
03:51:00.790 --> 03:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
these vaccines for today the acceptance
 
03:51:02.469 --> 03:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
rate of a vaccine process is a little
 
03:51:04.070 --> 03:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
bit different depending on a presumptive
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
approach versus one that's you know so
 
03:51:07.110 --> 03:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
opt-in versus opt-out from that
 
03:51:09.110 --> 03:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
standpoint so that's why we suspect if
 
03:51:11.750 --> 03:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't opt-in our utilization of that
 
03:51:13.910 --> 03:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
system would drop significantly it's
 
03:51:15.990 --> 03:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
still extremely important for a family
 
03:51:17.510 --> 03:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
to have an option to opt out they always
 
03:51:17.520 --> 03:51:18.630 align:start position:0%
to have an option to opt out they always
should

03:51:18.630 --> 03:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
should
 
03:51:20.309 --> 03:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
but that's why we're worried that going
 
03:51:22.389 --> 03:51:22.399 align:start position:0%
to an opt-in system would decrease the
 
03:51:24.550 --> 03:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
utilization of that system completely
 
03:51:26.469 --> 03:51:26.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you that sounds quite
 
03:51:26.479 --> 03:51:28.389 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you that sounds quite
manipulative

03:51:28.389 --> 03:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
manipulative
 
03:51:30.469 --> 03:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
my question is on the researchers who
 
03:51:33.349 --> 03:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
have access to the database
 
03:51:35.429 --> 03:51:35.439 align:start position:0%
so under the administrative rules and i
 
03:51:37.830 --> 03:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
understand you're here representing um
 
03:51:40.309 --> 03:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire medical society and
 
03:51:40.319 --> 03:51:41.110 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire medical society and
you

03:51:41.110 --> 03:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:51:41.120 --> 03:51:42.229 align:start position:0%
you
are

03:51:42.229 --> 03:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:51:44.710 --> 03:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
a doctor at dartmouth-hitchcock so you
 
03:51:46.630 --> 03:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
probably are familiar with some of the
 
03:51:49.030 --> 03:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
research that goes on um
 
03:51:52.229 --> 03:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
my question is under the rules for this
 
03:51:54.870 --> 03:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
researchers can have access
 
03:51:54.880 --> 03:51:56.550 align:start position:0%
researchers can have access
to

03:51:56.550 --> 03:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:51:58.389 --> 03:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
the information it says to persons
 
03:52:01.110 --> 03:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
conducting health related research upon
 
03:52:03.110 --> 03:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
receipt of approval
 
03:52:05.349 --> 03:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
so they they submit a
 
03:52:05.359 --> 03:52:07.590 align:start position:0%
so they they submit a
request

03:52:07.590 --> 03:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
request
 
03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
are you aware if there's any limitations
 
03:52:10.870 --> 03:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
of whether that
 
03:52:13.349 --> 03:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
is only is it scientific research is it
 
03:52:16.630 --> 03:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
political research um do you know
 
03:52:18.150 --> 03:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
any of the rules that i've got
 
03:52:20.469 --> 03:52:20.479 align:start position:0%
by training um so i have not not aware
 
03:52:21.750 --> 03:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
of how that would be used in that
 
03:52:23.830 --> 03:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
utility in that instance thank you okay
 
03:52:25.349 --> 03:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:28.229 --> 03:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:52:28.239 --> 03:52:29.269 align:start position:0%
any other questions
doctor

03:52:29.269 --> 03:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
03:52:31.510 --> 03:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
sorry representative kenner just a quick
 
03:52:33.670 --> 03:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
one um is it your impression
 
03:52:34.870 --> 03:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
particularly with this issue about
 
03:52:36.550 --> 03:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
03:52:36.560 --> 03:52:37.990 align:start position:0%
concern about
participation

03:52:37.990 --> 03:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
participation
 
03:52:38.000 --> 03:52:39.030 align:start position:0%
participation
that

03:52:39.030 --> 03:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:52:41.429 --> 03:52:41.439 align:start position:0%
many patients or parents do not
 
03:52:43.750 --> 03:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily understand the implications
 
03:52:46.550 --> 03:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
of how their care in future could be
 
03:52:48.950 --> 03:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
compromised by not being involved with
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
having a data set that's useful
 
03:52:53.189 --> 03:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
03:52:55.189 --> 03:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
yes that would be my concern that it
 
03:52:57.750 --> 03:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
requires more effort to explain what it
 
03:52:57.760 --> 03:52:58.550 align:start position:0%
requires more effort to explain what it
is

03:52:58.550 --> 03:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:53:00.070 --> 03:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
um as we kind of go through i want
 
03:53:02.229 --> 03:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
families to be able to ask questions and
 
03:53:04.229 --> 03:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
understand the process but that would be
 
03:53:05.990 --> 03:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
the concern that an opt-in would make it
 
03:53:07.910 --> 03:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
more onerous for us to make this a
 
03:53:11.030 --> 03:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:16.070 --> 03:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:17.510 --> 03:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and also thank you
 
03:53:20.309 --> 03:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my second question
 
03:53:21.670 --> 03:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of things about what's
 
03:53:24.070 --> 03:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
going into the database as a
 
03:53:24.080 --> 03:53:25.830 align:start position:0%
going into the database as a
pediatrician

03:53:25.830 --> 03:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
pediatrician
 
03:53:27.349 --> 03:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
one of both of you
 
03:53:29.349 --> 03:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
what data is absolutely necessary to be
 
03:53:32.229 --> 03:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
in that database in order for you to do
 
03:53:34.150 --> 03:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
and care for the patient in this case
 
03:53:36.710 --> 03:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
obviously be a child what actually has
 
03:53:39.110 --> 03:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
to go into the database because
 
03:53:40.790 --> 03:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing is it seems to be extra
 
03:53:42.389 --> 03:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
data going in there that may not be
 
03:53:46.070 --> 03:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:47.510 --> 03:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question i
 
03:53:49.750 --> 03:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
would say in this case i need to make
 
03:53:52.070 --> 03:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
sure that it is actually billy smith so
 
03:53:53.110 --> 03:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
all the different things that would
 
03:53:54.710 --> 03:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
require to make sure that it's this
 
03:53:56.389 --> 03:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
billy smith not that billy smith that
 
03:53:58.710 --> 03:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
i'm getting the information on so that
 
03:53:59.830 --> 03:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
would be the key piece and then the
 
03:54:01.990 --> 03:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
immunization piece so from a medical
 
03:54:03.830 --> 03:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
perspective that's the pieces i need is
 
03:54:05.830 --> 03:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
the immunization information and
 
03:54:07.670 --> 03:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
whatever is required true to me you know
 
03:54:09.269 --> 03:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
to be 100 certain that that's the
 
03:54:14.790 --> 03:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:16.469 --> 03:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
seeing no more hands thank you so much
 
03:54:18.389 --> 03:54:18.399 align:start position:0%
for your testimony appreciate your
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:26.309 --> 03:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes
 
03:54:29.670 --> 03:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
the honorable neil kirk
 
03:54:31.910 --> 03:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
long member of the house sometime
 
03:54:35.910 --> 03:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:38.790 --> 03:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
good afternoon to you mr chairman and
 
03:54:42.309 --> 03:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
punster now emeritus of the house
 
03:54:44.870 --> 03:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh i take second to you in that category
 
03:54:47.830 --> 03:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
sir i hope your committee is fully aware
 
03:54:50.630 --> 03:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
of your talents and have benefited from
 
03:54:52.309 --> 03:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
their exercise there have been more
 
03:54:55.790 --> 03:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:01.110 --> 03:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:04.150 --> 03:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
i was at the conception of the uh
 
03:55:07.269 --> 03:55:07.279 align:start position:0%
registry in 1998
 
03:55:10.469 --> 03:55:10.479 align:start position:0%
and indeed it is an opt-out registry the
 
03:55:13.030 --> 03:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
statute is very clear in section three
 
03:55:14.710 --> 03:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
although it doesn't use the words opt
 
03:55:14.720 --> 03:55:16.150 align:start position:0%
although it doesn't use the words opt
out

03:55:16.150 --> 03:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:55:18.870 --> 03:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
that this is an opt-out registry and the
 
03:55:20.389 --> 03:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
reason for that is important for this
 
03:55:23.429 --> 03:55:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:26.150 --> 03:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
i think the prior witness indicated
 
03:55:30.070 --> 03:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
something which i call human inertia
 
03:55:32.229 --> 03:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
most people tend to do nothing
 
03:55:34.950 --> 03:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
when faced with
 
03:55:34.960 --> 03:55:36.150 align:start position:0%
when faced with
life

03:55:36.150 --> 03:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
life
 
03:55:38.790 --> 03:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
and activities so if you set up a system
 
03:55:41.110 --> 03:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
where doing nothing has one result
 
03:55:42.870 --> 03:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to get that result
 
03:55:44.389 --> 03:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
if you set up the opposite system you're
 
03:55:46.469 --> 03:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
going to get that result
 
03:55:48.710 --> 03:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
at the time we put this into effect it
 
03:55:51.030 --> 03:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
was the judgment of all folks at the
 
03:55:53.349 --> 03:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
table that most people really either
 
03:55:55.429 --> 03:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
didn't care whether their information
 
03:55:57.269 --> 03:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
was in the registry or affirmatively
 
03:55:59.510 --> 03:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
would want to be there and a very small
 
03:55:59.520 --> 03:56:00.870 align:start position:0%
would want to be there and a very small
minority

03:56:00.870 --> 03:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
minority
 
03:56:03.189 --> 03:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
would be very concerned about privacy
 
03:56:04.870 --> 03:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
and not want it there
 
03:56:06.550 --> 03:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
i personally am one of that small
 
03:56:08.710 --> 03:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
minority but i recognize that there is a
 
03:56:11.030 --> 03:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
social benefit to having this
 
03:56:11.040 --> 03:56:12.229 align:start position:0%
social benefit to having this
information

03:56:12.229 --> 03:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:56:14.389 --> 03:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
from a public health point of view
 
03:56:16.150 --> 03:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
and so the agreement was we'd create an
 
03:56:18.389 --> 03:56:18.399 align:start position:0%
opt-out system basically if you did
 
03:56:22.229 --> 03:56:22.239 align:start position:0%
nothing you were in and if you wanted to
 
03:56:24.950 --> 03:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
be excluded you had to take an action
 
03:56:27.510 --> 03:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
the intention was that you would be
 
03:56:29.110 --> 03:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
presented with that opportunity
 
03:56:31.189 --> 03:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
literally a piece of paper right before
 
03:56:33.269 --> 03:56:33.279 align:start position:0%
you before the jab
 
03:56:34.630 --> 03:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
the first time at least with each
 
03:56:36.710 --> 03:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
provider that was the concept
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:44.630 --> 03:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
the representatives from the department
 
03:56:45.830 --> 03:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
of health and human
 
03:56:48.150 --> 03:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
services are extraordinarily hardworking
 
03:56:49.990 --> 03:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned people
 
03:56:52.790 --> 03:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
and they took the legislative directive
 
03:56:54.229 --> 03:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
public health when it comes to the
 
03:56:57.910 --> 03:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry very seriously
 
03:57:00.150 --> 03:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
they still haven't grasped
 
03:57:03.269 --> 03:57:03.279 align:start position:0%
the concept of privacy
 
03:57:04.830 --> 03:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
that should be embedded in that
 
03:57:07.030 --> 03:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
department and is embedded in the
 
03:57:10.870 --> 03:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
constitution you have house bill 1622 by
 
03:57:13.429 --> 03:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
representative edwards which attempts to
 
03:57:15.830 --> 03:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
put the department on record by
 
03:57:17.750 --> 03:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
establishing a privacy
 
03:57:20.150 --> 03:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
organization within the department to
 
03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
change the thinking of the department
 
03:57:23.990 --> 03:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
because right now the thinking is public
 
03:57:26.469 --> 03:57:26.479 align:start position:0%
health is absolutely imperative and
 
03:57:28.630 --> 03:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
privacy takes second place
 
03:57:31.030 --> 03:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
i think that's changing
 
03:57:32.870 --> 03:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
and representative edwards bill will do
 
03:57:34.790 --> 03:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
that but now you're faced with the
 
03:57:37.830 --> 03:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
dilemma in representative lang's bill
 
03:57:39.429 --> 03:57:39.439 align:start position:0%
how do we go about dealing with the
 
03:57:41.830 --> 03:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
balance between public health
 
03:57:43.269 --> 03:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
and privacy
 
03:57:45.189 --> 03:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
i can assure you that the constitutional
 
03:57:48.309 --> 03:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
amendment is really not in play here the
 
03:57:49.910 --> 03:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment would not be
 
03:57:52.950 --> 03:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
violated in the current system opt-in
 
03:57:55.110 --> 03:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh sorry opt-out or in the proposed
 
03:57:57.750 --> 03:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
system opt-in because in both cases
 
03:57:59.750 --> 03:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
people have a choice
 
03:58:02.870 --> 03:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
that's the key thing
 
03:58:04.950 --> 03:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
with the chair's permission
 
03:58:07.429 --> 03:58:07.439 align:start position:0%
i'd like to suggest an amendment which
 
03:58:09.830 --> 03:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
threads the needle
 
03:58:11.670 --> 03:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
before you do a representative just for
 
03:58:14.070 --> 03:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
the record the bill in question i i
 
03:58:17.189 --> 03:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
believe is 1662.
 
03:58:17.199 --> 03:58:18.389 align:start position:0%
believe is 1662.
representative

03:58:18.389 --> 03:58:18.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:58:20.309 --> 03:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i apologize that's all right i just
 
03:58:21.910 --> 03:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to get it
 
03:58:23.590 --> 03:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
on and yes proceed please with the
 
03:58:34.070 --> 03:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:56.070 --> 03:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:00.229 --> 03:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
the world has changed since uh 1998
 
03:59:00.239 --> 03:59:02.070 align:start position:0%
the world has changed since uh 1998
and

03:59:02.070 --> 03:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:04.469 --> 03:59:04.479 align:start position:0%
covet 19 has changed
 
03:59:06.309 --> 03:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
um some of the issues that we thought we
 
03:59:10.469 --> 03:59:10.479 align:start position:0%
had decided well in 1998.
 
03:59:12.790 --> 03:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
covert 19 has brought privacy to the
 
03:59:15.349 --> 03:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
fore with opt-out opponents increasingly
 
03:59:17.990 --> 03:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
vocal and possibly more numerous than
 
03:59:18.000 --> 03:59:19.429 align:start position:0%
vocal and possibly more numerous than
before

03:59:19.429 --> 03:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:59:22.229 --> 03:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
that is it's less clear to me now that
 
03:59:25.990 --> 03:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
fewer people would opt out
 
03:59:27.670 --> 03:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
i'd like to suggest a compromise for the
 
03:59:29.110 --> 03:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
committee's consideration and that's
 
03:59:34.950 --> 03:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:37.269 --> 03:59:37.279 align:start position:0%
it requires a person
 
03:59:38.790 --> 03:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
and although it doesn't say this and it
 
03:59:40.389 --> 03:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
should the first time
 
03:59:43.590 --> 03:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
a provider proposes to
 
03:59:45.990 --> 03:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
inoculate or immunize or vaccinate the
 
03:59:48.469 --> 03:59:48.479 align:start position:0%
person that the person choose and you
 
03:59:50.870 --> 03:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
see that right in front of you i choose
 
03:59:53.429 --> 03:59:53.439 align:start position:0%
either to participate or not to
 
03:59:56.309 --> 03:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
participate in the registry
 
03:59:58.309 --> 03:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
so there would be a conscious
 
04:00:00.870 --> 04:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
option before everyone not opt-in or
 
04:00:03.590 --> 04:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
opt-out but you choose
 
04:00:05.510 --> 04:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
it would be done once
 
04:00:07.990 --> 04:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
for each provider so if i went to
 
04:00:09.910 --> 04:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
hannaford's as
 
04:00:11.910 --> 04:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
was suggested hannafords would have to
 
04:00:13.830 --> 04:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
give me this option
 
04:00:15.670 --> 04:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
only the first time
 
04:00:17.830 --> 04:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
if i went back and back and back
 
04:00:19.110 --> 04:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
they would not have to give it to me
 
04:00:21.670 --> 04:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
again the only time they and if i didn't
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
want to participate i could fill out the
 
04:00:25.189 --> 04:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
department's form by the way one of the
 
04:00:26.870 --> 04:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
problems with the department's forms is
 
04:00:28.630 --> 04:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
because they really want to get
 
04:00:30.550 --> 04:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
everybody in the registry is they made
 
04:00:33.030 --> 04:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
it difficult for people to opt out they
 
04:00:35.510 --> 04:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
made it difficult to withdraw
 
04:00:36.950 --> 04:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
because you have to get a provider
 
04:00:39.590 --> 04:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
signature but gee i've changed providers
 
04:00:41.510 --> 04:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
or i no longer have a provider what do i
 
04:00:43.830 --> 04:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
do how much time does it take come on i
 
04:00:45.910 --> 04:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
want to watch the football game i'm not
 
04:00:48.229 --> 04:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
going to do this so the department needs
 
04:00:49.990 --> 04:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
to recognize that everything has to be
 
04:00:52.150 --> 04:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
as easy as possible up front no
 
04:00:54.309 --> 04:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
unnecessary hurdles
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
one other thing
 
04:00:58.070 --> 04:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
i think the committee should focus on
 
04:01:00.389 --> 04:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
the opt-in opt-out there are a lot of
 
04:01:02.630 --> 04:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
questions raised about the kind of
 
04:01:04.630 --> 04:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
information that's in the registry who
 
04:01:06.630 --> 04:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
has access to it and things like this
 
04:01:08.630 --> 04:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
these are important questions
 
04:01:10.950 --> 04:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
but they deserve bills of their own
 
04:01:13.030 --> 04:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
because this bill really focuses on one
 
04:01:14.790 --> 04:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
part of it there are problems with the
 
04:01:16.229 --> 04:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
registry that this committee should
 
04:01:18.550 --> 04:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
address but not necessarily through this
 
04:01:18.560 --> 04:01:20.309 align:start position:0%
address but not necessarily through this
bill

04:01:20.309 --> 04:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:01:22.469 --> 04:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
going on with this
 
04:01:22.479 --> 04:01:24.229 align:start position:0%
going on with this
amendment

04:01:24.229 --> 04:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:01:25.590 --> 04:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
those are the only two things that you
 
04:01:26.790 --> 04:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
04:01:30.389 --> 04:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
choose and there's a check off box
 
04:01:31.750 --> 04:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
it says
 
04:01:33.269 --> 04:01:33.279 align:start position:0%
i understand this decision will not
 
04:01:35.349 --> 04:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
prevent me or my child from receiving
 
04:01:37.189 --> 04:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
immunizations and i understand i can
 
04:01:39.349 --> 04:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
reverse my decision at any time and then
 
04:01:42.309 --> 04:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:43.990 --> 04:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
it also says that if you sign it you're
 
04:01:45.510 --> 04:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
still not relieved from your obligation
 
04:01:47.269 --> 04:01:47.279 align:start position:0%
to get vaccinations
 
04:01:50.150 --> 04:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
in statute okay and that's all it does
 
04:01:52.469 --> 04:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
notice a doctor signature isn't required
 
04:01:53.429 --> 04:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have anything
 
04:01:57.349 --> 04:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
notarized it's very easy very simple
 
04:01:58.710 --> 04:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to point out the things at
 
04:02:00.150 --> 04:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the page because they're
 
04:02:01.990 --> 04:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
equally important
 
04:02:03.750 --> 04:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
number one no other substantive
 
04:02:06.550 --> 04:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
information shall appear on the form
 
04:02:08.710 --> 04:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
it's important that
 
04:02:10.790 --> 04:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
the department not add other things to
 
04:02:13.349 --> 04:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
this which would complicate things
 
04:02:14.790 --> 04:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
number two this form shall be on a
 
04:02:16.710 --> 04:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
separate piece of paper or on a separate
 
04:02:18.309 --> 04:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
electronic screen
 
04:02:20.630 --> 04:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
it can't be buried
 
04:02:23.189 --> 04:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
number three c
 
04:02:25.349 --> 04:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
no one shall administer
 
04:02:27.349 --> 04:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
a vaccination immunization until the
 
04:02:29.110 --> 04:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
form is completed at least for the first
 
04:02:30.469 --> 04:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
time and i admit
 
04:02:32.469 --> 04:02:32.479 align:start position:0%
that first time doesn't appear here and
 
04:02:33.590 --> 04:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
needs to
 
04:02:36.790 --> 04:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:38.229 --> 04:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
if the patient
 
04:02:40.150 --> 04:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
elects not to participate
 
04:02:42.790 --> 04:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
then no information about this form goes
 
04:02:49.269 --> 04:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:51.590 --> 04:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
the reason for putting the form in
 
04:02:51.600 --> 04:02:52.950 align:start position:0%
the reason for putting the form in
statute

04:02:52.950 --> 04:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:02:55.110 --> 04:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
rather than going through jail car
 
04:02:57.590 --> 04:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
two reasons gel cart takes forever it'll
 
04:02:59.830 --> 04:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
take you six months at least to get it
 
04:03:02.550 --> 04:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
through and during the process
 
04:03:04.150 --> 04:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps the department will change the
 
04:03:05.670 --> 04:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
form in a way that the legislature
 
04:03:07.429 --> 04:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
hadn't intended and gel card doesn't
 
04:03:07.439 --> 04:03:12.710 align:start position:0%
hadn't intended and gel card doesn't
catch

04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:15.030 --> 04:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
so for those two reasons time and making
 
04:03:16.790 --> 04:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
sure that what the legislator sets as
 
04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
policy in fact occurs requires this form
 
04:03:22.550 --> 04:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
to be in statute
 
04:03:24.150 --> 04:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
there was one other disturbing info
 
04:03:25.750 --> 04:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
piece of information that you folks had
 
04:03:27.189 --> 04:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
that needs to be dealt with but again
 
04:03:28.550 --> 04:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
not in this bill and that's the
 
04:03:30.309 --> 04:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
vaccination event
 
04:03:32.309 --> 04:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
because that definition which is in
 
04:03:35.269 --> 04:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
rules not in statute
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
allows the department to get a huge
 
04:03:38.630 --> 04:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
amount of information that was not the
 
04:03:38.640 --> 04:03:39.830 align:start position:0%
amount of information that was not the
legislation

04:03:39.830 --> 04:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:03:42.389 --> 04:03:42.399 align:start position:0%
certainly not at the time in 1998 was
 
04:03:45.030 --> 04:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature's intent so
 
04:03:47.590 --> 04:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
to sum up
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
let's make sure that everybody makes an
 
04:03:51.030 --> 04:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
informed decision let's make sure that
 
04:03:52.870 --> 04:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
this informed decision is made the first
 
04:03:54.950 --> 04:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
time you go for a vaccination
 
04:03:56.710 --> 04:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
and let's assume the legislature sets
 
04:03:59.349 --> 04:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
policy not the department and that
 
04:04:02.070 --> 04:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
privacy and choice is very important
 
04:04:04.870 --> 04:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
even in this area where we all agree
 
04:04:07.429 --> 04:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
that a vaccination registry contains
 
04:04:09.990 --> 04:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
very important information for providers
 
04:04:11.670 --> 04:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
it's very important for individual
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
families and people and it's very
 
04:04:15.830 --> 04:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
important for public health
 
04:04:17.590 --> 04:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
and the statute is clear as to what uses
 
04:04:19.429 --> 04:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
will be made of this to prov to protect
 
04:04:21.189 --> 04:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
public health
 
04:04:23.189 --> 04:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't denigrate the registry we
 
04:04:25.189 --> 04:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
shouldn't try to denude it but we should
 
04:04:27.269 --> 04:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
allow individuals to choose whether or
 
04:04:29.910 --> 04:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
not they want their information to to be
 
04:04:32.710 --> 04:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
in there even if it means at the end of
 
04:04:35.349 --> 04:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
the day that the registry is not as
 
04:04:38.550 --> 04:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
useful as it would otherwise be
 
04:04:40.070 --> 04:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'd be pleased to
 
04:04:41.750 --> 04:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if there are if
 
04:04:43.990 --> 04:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
there are any
 
04:04:45.750 --> 04:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative connect
 
04:04:47.670 --> 04:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much just a quick one um
 
04:04:49.189 --> 04:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
you made a comment about so that the
 
04:04:50.550 --> 04:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
department could not add any other
 
04:04:52.150 --> 04:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
further information
 
04:04:56.229 --> 04:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
but um i was wondering because we again
 
04:04:58.710 --> 04:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
a person or a parent or a patient may
 
04:05:01.510 --> 04:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
not be aware of some of the downsides of
 
04:05:03.429 --> 04:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
not having this information available as
 
04:05:05.429 --> 04:05:05.439 align:start position:0%
we just heard for the from the previous
 
04:05:05.439 --> 04:05:06.630 align:start position:0%
we just heard for the from the previous
testimony

04:05:06.630 --> 04:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:05:08.630 --> 04:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
would it be reasonable to at least
 
04:05:11.429 --> 04:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
modify this to say that this could
 
04:05:11.439 --> 04:05:13.030 align:start position:0%
modify this to say that this could
compromise

04:05:13.030 --> 04:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
04:05:15.590 --> 04:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
the ability of a provider to access
 
04:05:17.429 --> 04:05:17.439 align:start position:0%
needed information for care in the
 
04:05:17.439 --> 04:05:19.510 align:start position:0%
needed information for care in the
future

04:05:19.510 --> 04:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
future
 
04:05:22.150 --> 04:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative knurk you've
 
04:05:24.070 --> 04:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
come across as usual with one of the
 
04:05:27.189 --> 04:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
problems with all these forms
 
04:05:28.790 --> 04:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
if you put that down you're going to
 
04:05:30.710 --> 04:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
have a major battle as to what you
 
04:05:32.550 --> 04:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
should be saying there because one side
 
04:05:34.150 --> 04:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
will say you've gone too far and the
 
04:05:35.510 --> 04:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
other side will say you haven't gone far
 
04:05:35.520 --> 04:05:36.630 align:start position:0%
other side will say you haven't gone far
enough

04:05:36.630 --> 04:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
enough
 
04:05:39.030 --> 04:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
if you can thread that needle more power
 
04:05:41.910 --> 04:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
to you but please it's the legislature
 
04:05:43.590 --> 04:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
that needs to thread that needle do not
 
04:05:45.510 --> 04:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
leave it to the department because no
 
04:05:47.189 --> 04:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
one will be satisfied with what the
 
04:05:48.870 --> 04:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
department does
 
04:05:50.950 --> 04:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
it you should include the department in
 
04:05:53.349 --> 04:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
consultation so you get the information
 
04:05:54.550 --> 04:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
and they're pretty good at presenting
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
good information to you but ultimately
 
04:05:58.790 --> 04:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's a policy decision it shouldn't be
 
04:06:00.550 --> 04:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
left to rules
 
04:06:04.309 --> 04:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:06.229 --> 04:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
04:06:10.150 --> 04:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
it's really simple you had said
 
04:06:13.189 --> 04:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
the first time someone goes to hannaford
 
04:06:14.790 --> 04:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
then they're presented with this form
 
04:06:17.189 --> 04:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
what if they go after going to hannaford
 
04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
they go to you know dr
 
04:06:19.680 --> 04:06:20.710 align:start position:0%
they go to you know dr
oz

04:06:20.710 --> 04:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
oz
 
04:06:23.590 --> 04:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
does he present this the form again is
 
04:06:26.070 --> 04:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
there is there so is it the first time
 
04:06:29.910 --> 04:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
you go to a different provider for okay
 
04:06:32.229 --> 04:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
um just just so you know i don't think
 
04:06:34.150 --> 04:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
you want to use dr oz's name he's
 
04:06:35.830 --> 04:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
running for senate i don't believe he's
 
04:06:37.750 --> 04:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
practicing at the moment he certainly is
 
04:06:40.550 --> 04:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
not writing his column anymore thank you
 
04:06:45.429 --> 04:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:47.349 --> 04:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm i'm following up
 
04:06:49.510 --> 04:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
because i'm i'm intrigued by the forum
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
because it's simple which i really like
 
04:06:55.830 --> 04:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
and simple and the same for everybody i
 
04:06:59.429 --> 04:06:59.439 align:start position:0%
think is a very good idea
 
04:07:02.469 --> 04:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
my question has to do with the timing
 
04:07:04.389 --> 04:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
it's clear
 
04:07:07.349 --> 04:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
because what it says is prior to
 
04:07:10.950 --> 04:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
receiving any immunization which would
 
04:07:13.189 --> 04:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
say to me that
 
04:07:14.950 --> 04:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
each time
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
johnny comes in
 
04:07:19.590 --> 04:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know if the doctor says okay johnny
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
is due for a b and c this time
 
04:07:24.790 --> 04:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
and the parent says yes we want to go
 
04:07:28.950 --> 04:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
ahead with that they get the form and
 
04:07:28.960 --> 04:07:30.469 align:start position:0%
ahead with that they get the form and
and

04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
in your testimony that doesn't sound
 
04:07:34.389 --> 04:07:34.399 align:start position:0%
like it's your intent
 
04:07:36.630 --> 04:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
but i wonder
 
04:07:38.630 --> 04:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:07:40.950 --> 04:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
i i i thank you for the question i i
 
04:07:43.110 --> 04:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
04:07:43.120 --> 04:07:43.990 align:start position:0%
understand that
so

04:07:43.990 --> 04:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
what i'm grappling with is
 
04:07:48.000 --> 04:07:49.429 align:start position:0%
what i'm grappling with is
the

04:07:49.429 --> 04:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
i mean part of me says that it's
 
04:07:54.070 --> 04:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
probably best to do that each time
 
04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
simply because somebody has to think
 
04:07:57.030 --> 04:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
about it
 
04:08:01.030 --> 04:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
and we seem to be encouraging that
 
04:08:03.349 --> 04:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
and it's a simple form so it's not a
 
04:08:05.830 --> 04:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
huge roadblock
 
04:08:05.840 --> 04:08:07.429 align:start position:0%
huge roadblock
but

04:08:07.429 --> 04:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:08:09.269 --> 04:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
could you
 
04:08:12.149 --> 04:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
if that was not your intent
 
04:08:14.149 --> 04:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
which you said it wasn't could you also
 
04:08:18.550 --> 04:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
propose to us the exact language to use
 
04:08:18.560 --> 04:08:19.670 align:start position:0%
propose to us the exact language to use
for

04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:08:21.990 --> 04:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
this the first time you go to the
 
04:08:24.550 --> 04:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
provider and then you will be provided
 
04:08:27.349 --> 04:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
by for the the form by each subsequent
 
04:08:29.189 --> 04:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
provider if you would think about that
 
04:08:32.229 --> 04:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
and let us know that would be helpful um
 
04:08:33.670 --> 04:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weber i have
 
04:08:35.750 --> 04:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
thought about it and i do have the
 
04:08:37.830 --> 04:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
language i've modified the form i will
 
04:08:39.990 --> 04:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
send the language to you folks
 
04:08:41.990 --> 04:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
the the intent is
 
04:08:42.000 --> 04:08:43.189 align:start position:0%
the the intent is
that

04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:08:45.429 --> 04:08:45.439 align:start position:0%
the first time you go to a provider you
 
04:08:47.590 --> 04:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
get the form you make your decision
 
04:08:49.510 --> 04:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
after that let's make life easy for all
 
04:08:51.189 --> 04:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
of us you don't have to be asked 16
 
04:08:51.199 --> 04:08:52.229 align:start position:0%
of us you don't have to be asked 16
times

04:08:52.229 --> 04:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
times
 
04:08:54.149 --> 04:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
but if you go to a second provider a
 
04:08:55.750 --> 04:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
different provider that's the first time
 
04:08:57.830 --> 04:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
you've gone to the second provider then
 
04:08:59.349 --> 04:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
that second provider needs to give you
 
04:09:00.389 --> 04:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
the form
 
04:09:02.550 --> 04:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
just for the first time so you may fill
 
04:09:04.790 --> 04:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
out this form many times during your
 
04:09:07.110 --> 04:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
child's medical career if you change
 
04:09:09.269 --> 04:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
doctors during that period of time or
 
04:09:12.830 --> 04:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
get your vaccinations from different
 
04:09:16.710 --> 04:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
agencies i have a question um
 
04:09:19.110 --> 04:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
where would you put this in the bill are
 
04:09:21.750 --> 04:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
you replacing something or adding a new
 
04:09:24.149 --> 04:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
section um
 
04:09:25.990 --> 04:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
i would delete the language that
 
04:09:29.189 --> 04:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
representative lang has which is 2a
 
04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
and this is simply an amendment to
 
04:09:31.680 --> 04:09:32.710 align:start position:0%
and this is simply an amendment to
section

04:09:32.710 --> 04:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:09:32.720 --> 04:09:33.670 align:start position:0%
section
um

04:09:33.670 --> 04:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:38.070 --> 04:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
141 c 20 f roman 2 by adding the bolded
 
04:09:40.550 --> 04:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
language all of my bolded language here
 
04:09:42.469 --> 04:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
is in addition to
 
04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
the existing language in section roman 2
 
04:09:47.670 --> 04:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
which says no patient etc shall be
 
04:09:49.110 --> 04:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
required to participate in the
 
04:09:51.910 --> 04:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
immunization registry
 
04:09:56.550 --> 04:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:56.560 --> 04:09:57.990 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:09:57.990 --> 04:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:09:58.000 --> 04:10:02.710 align:start position:0%

04:10:02.710 --> 04:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:05.510 --> 04:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair chairman and also was
 
04:10:07.030 --> 04:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
good to see you
 
04:10:10.309 --> 04:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
former representative neil kirk the
 
04:10:13.590 --> 04:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
honorable the honorable now yes um in
 
04:10:17.189 --> 04:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
regards to the forums
 
04:10:18.469 --> 04:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
is there
 
04:10:21.110 --> 04:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
your opinion if you will of instead of
 
04:10:23.110 --> 04:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
relying upon the paper form which goes
 
04:10:24.790 --> 04:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
in the provider's office and it doesn't
 
04:10:26.630 --> 04:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
trans travel with the patient from
 
04:10:28.950 --> 04:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
provider to provider to provider
 
04:10:31.670 --> 04:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
of putting in the registry
 
04:10:33.990 --> 04:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
the patient's name with a notation i
 
04:10:36.309 --> 04:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
have opted out
 
04:10:36.319 --> 04:10:39.189 align:start position:0%
have opted out
uh um

04:10:39.189 --> 04:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:40.309 --> 04:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question but i
 
04:10:41.670 --> 04:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
personally would have a problem with
 
04:10:41.680 --> 04:10:42.790 align:start position:0%
personally would have a problem with
that

04:10:42.790 --> 04:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:44.630 --> 04:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
it's none of the state's business to
 
04:10:44.640 --> 04:10:45.510 align:start position:0%
it's none of the state's business to
know

04:10:45.510 --> 04:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:10:47.110 --> 04:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
that i've opted out
 
04:10:48.870 --> 04:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
that's a private matter
 
04:10:50.389 --> 04:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
the only thing that the registry is
 
04:10:52.229 --> 04:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
supposed to contain is my vaccination
 
04:10:53.830 --> 04:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
history if i choose not to give it to
 
04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
the state they shouldn't get that
 
04:10:57.830 --> 04:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
information we went
 
04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
we were head to head on this issue 20
 
04:11:05.429 --> 04:11:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:07.269 --> 04:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
that perhaps would
 
04:11:09.030 --> 04:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
would violate the privacy amendment
 
04:11:11.110 --> 04:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
because this is unnecessary information
 
04:11:13.269 --> 04:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
that the state is collecting
 
04:11:15.990 --> 04:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
that they know my vaccination status so
 
04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
in effect
 
04:11:19.349 --> 04:11:19.359 align:start position:0%
your suggestion would mean that i
 
04:11:21.110 --> 04:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't opt out they would at least
 
04:11:22.870 --> 04:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
know that i had opted out and they want
 
04:11:24.870 --> 04:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
to know that for very valid public
 
04:11:26.309 --> 04:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
health reasons after all there's an
 
04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
emergency there's a another pandemic
 
04:11:29.990 --> 04:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
they need to know who's vaccinated who
 
04:11:32.550 --> 04:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
isn't uh where the clusters are they'd
 
04:11:34.550 --> 04:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
love to have that information but i
 
04:11:36.790 --> 04:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
think it goes beyond what they should
 
04:11:36.800 --> 04:11:38.070 align:start position:0%
think it goes beyond what they should
have

04:11:38.070 --> 04:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:11:39.670 --> 04:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
especially with respect to the privacy
 
04:11:39.680 --> 04:11:41.510 align:start position:0%
especially with respect to the privacy
amendment

04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:11:41.520 --> 04:11:43.110 align:start position:0%
amendment
follow-up

04:11:43.110 --> 04:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
i hear the concern
 
04:11:49.030 --> 04:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:51.110 --> 04:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
by st making the statement you opted out
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
of the registry does not mean that you
 
04:11:54.389 --> 04:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
actually are
 
04:11:56.070 --> 04:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
saying you have or have not received a
 
04:11:57.670 --> 04:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine it's just a question at that
 
04:12:00.309 --> 04:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
point in time if i'm a medical provider
 
04:12:02.950 --> 04:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
and trying to find out if therefore be
 
04:12:05.349 --> 04:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
able to ask the parent or the
 
04:12:05.359 --> 04:12:06.469 align:start position:0%
able to ask the parent or the
patient

04:12:06.469 --> 04:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
patient
 
04:12:08.309 --> 04:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
about the status of the vaccines because
 
04:12:09.750 --> 04:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
right now if
 
04:12:11.910 --> 04:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in there for the medical
 
04:12:11.920 --> 04:12:12.950 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in there for the medical
provider

04:12:12.950 --> 04:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
provider
 
04:12:14.550 --> 04:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
to know whether the patient even opted
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
out of it doesn't mean they didn't get
 
04:12:17.670 --> 04:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
the vaccine just means they didn't want
 
04:12:19.590 --> 04:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
to opt into the registry there's two
 
04:12:20.790 --> 04:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
separate things going on one's the
 
04:12:22.149 --> 04:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
information the other was just not
 
04:12:24.309 --> 04:12:24.319 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment that i opted out of the
 
04:12:24.319 --> 04:12:25.990 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment that i opted out of the
registry

04:12:25.990 --> 04:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
registry
 
04:12:27.189 --> 04:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question my
 
04:12:28.630 --> 04:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the physician's
 
04:12:30.550 --> 04:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
office keeps a record
 
04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
his own medical records of the
 
04:12:34.630 --> 04:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
vaccinations he's given to you
 
04:12:35.830 --> 04:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
and regardless of whether that
 
04:12:37.670 --> 04:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
information stays in the office because
 
04:12:40.229 --> 04:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
you've opted out or goes stays in the
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
office and goes to the registry because
 
04:12:46.469 --> 04:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:50.710 --> 04:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
has has no impact on on that information
 
04:12:53.349 --> 04:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
if you look at d here it's very clear if
 
04:12:56.830 --> 04:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
the patient elects not to participate
 
04:12:59.349 --> 04:12:59.359 align:start position:0%
um no personally identifiable
 
04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
information about the patient's guard
 
04:13:03.110 --> 04:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
shall be disclosed indirectly or
 
04:13:05.670 --> 04:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
directly to the state of new hampshire
 
04:13:07.990 --> 04:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
if you choose not to participate in the
 
04:13:10.710 --> 04:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
registry no information about you your
 
04:13:12.309 --> 04:13:12.319 align:start position:0%
name your address whether you were
 
04:13:17.349 --> 04:13:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:20.630 --> 04:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
just to be clear so this amendment would
 
04:13:24.950 --> 04:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
be a replace all yes from the original
 
04:13:27.030 --> 04:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
bill thank you
 
04:13:30.149 --> 04:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:32.710 --> 04:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you thank
 
04:13:32.720 --> 04:13:33.429 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you thank
you

04:13:33.429 --> 04:13:33.439 align:start position:0%

04:13:35.349 --> 04:13:35.359 align:start position:0%
your honorable
 
04:13:37.429 --> 04:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
i've i'm going to disagree with you i
 
04:13:40.070 --> 04:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
love the form i think it's wonderful but
 
04:13:42.870 --> 04:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
i think the intent is not written into
 
04:13:45.110 --> 04:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
the form and therefore i think if the
 
04:13:47.110 --> 04:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
combination is better
 
04:13:50.710 --> 04:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
my opinion is also that
 
04:13:52.389 --> 04:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
in a busy office you're supposed to
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
remember if this patient has been here
 
04:13:57.750 --> 04:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
before what if it's a different person
 
04:14:00.870 --> 04:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
why not just use the form every single
 
04:14:04.710 --> 04:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
time it's very easy to check yes or no
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
and that way
 
04:14:08.229 --> 04:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
it still goes in the record for every
 
04:14:10.309 --> 04:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
single vaccination somewhere on here it
 
04:14:13.750 --> 04:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
has to say which vaccination it was
 
04:14:17.510 --> 04:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
um because the doctor's going to keep it
 
04:14:19.189 --> 04:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
i know this is supposed to be a question
 
04:14:21.349 --> 04:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm working on that i i think i
 
04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
understand the question yeah so that's
 
04:14:25.429 --> 04:14:25.439 align:start position:0%
two two issues here
 
04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
every time put the name on
 
04:14:28.399 --> 04:14:29.349 align:start position:0%
every time put the name on
and

04:14:29.349 --> 04:14:29.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:29.359 --> 04:14:30.149 align:start position:0%
and
okay

04:14:30.149 --> 04:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:14:32.149 --> 04:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
the yeah
 
04:14:34.469 --> 04:14:34.479 align:start position:0%
there's a price that we pay
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
for bureaucracy there's a price that we
 
04:14:38.389 --> 04:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
pay for privacy
 
04:14:40.710 --> 04:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
filling out these forms is going to be
 
04:14:42.550 --> 04:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
somewhat onerous it will as the
 
04:14:43.990 --> 04:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
department told you it's going to cost
 
04:14:45.910 --> 04:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
some money
 
04:14:48.229 --> 04:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
from my point of view that's not an
 
04:14:51.269 --> 04:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
unreasonable price to pay for protecting
 
04:14:53.910 --> 04:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
privacy however
 
04:14:56.070 --> 04:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
and this is in direct response to your
 
04:14:58.469 --> 04:14:58.479 align:start position:0%
question representative gay
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
if you do it every time
 
04:15:03.189 --> 04:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
is the extra benefit from that worth the
 
04:15:04.870 --> 04:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
extra cost
 
04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
and that's a policy question for this
 
04:15:07.439 --> 04:15:08.389 align:start position:0%
and that's a policy question for this
committee

04:15:08.389 --> 04:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:15:10.469 --> 04:15:10.479 align:start position:0%
personally i think it's not
 
04:15:12.149 --> 04:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
but i certainly wouldn't be a verse if
 
04:15:14.309 --> 04:15:14.319 align:start position:0%
the committee said no we think every
 
04:15:21.110 --> 04:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:23.189 --> 04:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions and and
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:15:26.389 --> 04:15:26.399 align:start position:0%

04:19:05.030 --> 04:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:05.040 --> 04:19:38.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:19:38.790 --> 04:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:54.790 --> 04:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:54.800 --> 04:20:00.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:20:00.630 --> 04:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:23.590 --> 04:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:27.349 --> 04:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:38.830 --> 04:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:55.990 --> 04:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:56.000 --> 04:21:12.309 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:21:12.309 --> 04:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:12.319 --> 04:21:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
pharmacies

04:21:23.510 --> 04:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:23.520 --> 04:21:39.510 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:21:39.510 --> 04:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:16.870 --> 04:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:16.880 --> 04:22:22.149 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:22:22.149 --> 04:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:22.159 --> 04:22:37.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:22:37.510 --> 04:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:37.520 --> 04:22:49.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:22:49.510 --> 04:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:49.520 --> 04:23:03.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:23:03.030 --> 04:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:14.790 --> 04:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:16.309 --> 04:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know what's going to happen with
 
04:23:17.590 --> 04:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
that that's probably a build for the
 
04:23:19.269 --> 04:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
next session
 
04:23:21.349 --> 04:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
but something like that
 
04:23:31.830 --> 04:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.840 --> 04:23:53.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:23:53.910 --> 04:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:56.950 --> 04:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's dead thank you for that
 
04:23:56.960 --> 04:24:24.550 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's dead thank you for that
advice

04:24:24.550 --> 04:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:24.560 --> 04:24:26.309 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:24:26.309 --> 04:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:51.030 --> 04:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:53.110 --> 04:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
some of that has extended to
 
04:25:18.070 --> 04:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:32.880 --> 04:25:44.149 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:25:44.149 --> 04:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:44.159 --> 04:25:47.110 align:start position:0%
 
thank

04:25:47.110 --> 04:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:47.120 --> 04:26:01.110 align:start position:0%
 
all you

04:26:01.110 --> 04:26:01.120 align:start position:0%

even

04:26:02.990 --> 04:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
even
 
04:26:47.110 --> 04:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:47.120 --> 04:27:35.349 align:start position:0%
 
things

04:27:35.349 --> 04:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:35.359 --> 04:28:40.710 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:28:40.710 --> 04:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:40.720 --> 04:29:02.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:29:02.830 --> 04:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:48.469 --> 04:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:48.479 --> 04:30:07.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:30:07.110 --> 04:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:46.070 --> 04:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:46.080 --> 04:31:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
regulated

04:31:10.790 --> 04:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:10.800 --> 04:31:42.229 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:31:42.229 --> 04:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:42.239 --> 04:33:28.150 align:start position:0%
 
paulie

04:33:28.150 --> 04:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:28.160 --> 04:35:01.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:35:01.670 --> 04:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:01.680 --> 04:35:13.029 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:35:13.029 --> 04:35:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:13.039 --> 04:35:33.429 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:35:33.429 --> 04:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:33.439 --> 04:35:36.789 align:start position:0%
 
mmm

04:35:36.789 --> 04:35:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:36.799 --> 04:35:53.029 align:start position:0%
 
itself

04:35:53.029 --> 04:35:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:53.039 --> 04:36:41.189 align:start position:0%
 
questions

04:36:41.189 --> 04:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:41.199 --> 04:36:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:36:57.830 --> 04:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:57.840 --> 04:37:06.869 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:37:06.869 --> 04:37:06.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:50.551 --> 04:37:50.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:50.561 --> 04:38:16.551 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:38:16.551 --> 04:38:16.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:24.150 --> 04:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:25.990 --> 04:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
this believe me is not a housekeeping
 
04:38:26.000 --> 04:38:28.070 align:start position:0%
this believe me is not a housekeeping
bill

04:38:28.070 --> 04:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:38:30.070 --> 04:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
but you know what when lucy ever jumped
 
04:38:32.150 --> 04:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
in as she did it led me to have a
 
04:38:33.750 --> 04:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
lengthy conversation with the
 
04:38:36.551 --> 04:38:36.561 align:start position:0%
commissioner of dhhs
 
04:38:38.949 --> 04:38:38.959 align:start position:0%
who said there's a lot of people
 
04:38:40.869 --> 04:38:40.879 align:start position:0%
appointed by title
 
04:38:43.349 --> 04:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
to the ethics committee
 
04:38:45.429 --> 04:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
and she said they may be ethical people
 
04:38:46.869 --> 04:38:46.879 align:start position:0%
but i don't think they've ever studied
 
04:38:49.269 --> 04:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
athletes so if i went to them for advice
 
04:38:52.390 --> 04:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
it would just be economic
 
04:38:55.029 --> 04:38:55.039 align:start position:0%
constituent group or whatever i said
 
04:38:56.709 --> 04:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
let's put together what an ethics
 
04:38:58.390 --> 04:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
committee should be
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
six to eight people at most
 
04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
all trained in ethics that when you have
 
04:39:05.109 --> 04:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
an ethical question they won't give you
 
04:39:07.029 --> 04:39:07.039 align:start position:0%
a political answer
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
so we're rewriting the bill so
 
04:39:12.150 --> 04:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
housekeeping turned into a complete redo
 
04:39:48.390 --> 04:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:48.400 --> 04:40:02.948 align:start position:0%
 
sure

04:40:02.948 --> 04:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:06.150 --> 04:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
it's odds what we tell our patients
 
04:40:06.160 --> 04:40:07.270 align:start position:0%
it's odds what we tell our patients
is

04:40:07.270 --> 04:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:40:09.830 --> 04:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
if you get the vaccines
 
04:40:11.430 --> 04:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
here are the odds
 
04:40:14.390 --> 04:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
of you still getting covered and the
 
04:40:16.310 --> 04:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
severity these are odds these are
 
04:40:16.320 --> 04:40:17.510 align:start position:0%
severity these are odds these are
generalized

04:40:17.510 --> 04:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
generalized
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
and if you don't
 
04:40:22.150 --> 04:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
you won't have horrible reactions to the
 
04:40:24.230 --> 04:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine by definition
 
04:40:25.350 --> 04:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
which the
 
04:40:27.430 --> 04:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
two daughters of one of my providers had
 
04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:33.270 --> 04:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
so let's tell you
 
04:40:34.948 --> 04:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
all the truth
 
04:40:37.670 --> 04:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
and if you want to go on this podcast or
 
04:40:38.948 --> 04:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
that blog
 
04:40:41.590 --> 04:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
and get ideology
 
04:40:41.600 --> 04:40:42.470 align:start position:0%
and get ideology
any

04:40:42.470 --> 04:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:40:47.350 --> 04:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:49.350 --> 04:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
so we have to say we don't know
 
04:40:51.750 --> 04:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
this is uncharted territory
 
04:40:53.830 --> 04:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
how many years did it take to figure to
 
04:40:56.230 --> 04:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
get the little bugs out of the polio
 
04:40:58.868 --> 04:40:58.878 align:start position:0%
vaccine system because yeah it was odds
 
04:41:00.310 --> 04:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
and my parents
 
04:41:03.350 --> 04:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
in 1955 when it first came out
 
04:41:05.430 --> 04:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
knew that there were a few kids that had
 
04:41:06.868 --> 04:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
harmed for life
 
04:41:08.470 --> 04:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
there were also a lot of kids that
 
04:41:09.910 --> 04:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
didn't get polio
 
04:41:13.110 --> 04:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
so they knew it was ours
 
04:41:14.868 --> 04:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
then you work to see what you can do
 
04:41:28.230 --> 04:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:28.240 --> 04:41:55.430 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:41:55.430 --> 04:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:55.440 --> 04:42:49.030 align:start position:0%
 
interesting

04:42:49.030 --> 04:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:49.040 --> 04:42:49.708 align:start position:0%
 
how

04:42:49.708 --> 04:42:49.718 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:43:03.990 --> 04:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:04.000 --> 04:43:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:43:23.030 --> 04:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:23.040 --> 04:43:33.190 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:43:33.190 --> 04:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:48.708 --> 04:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:48.718 --> 04:44:27.350 align:start position:0%

is

04:45:26.470 --> 04:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:26.480 --> 04:45:42.628 align:start position:0%
 
um

is

04:45:57.350 --> 04:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:57.360 --> 04:46:08.150 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:46:08.150 --> 04:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:08.160 --> 04:46:49.590 align:start position:0%

the bill
 
05:02:02.150 --> 05:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:04.868 --> 05:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
05:02:07.030 --> 05:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
i remember watching public service
 
05:02:07.040 --> 05:02:08.628 align:start position:0%
i remember watching public service
announcements

05:02:08.628 --> 05:02:08.638 align:start position:0%
announcements
 
05:02:11.590 --> 05:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
on the boston tv stations
 
05:02:13.670 --> 05:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
talking about repression
 
05:02:15.670 --> 05:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
of conscience
 
05:02:18.390 --> 05:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
around the world
 
05:02:20.310 --> 05:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
as i recall
 
05:02:22.628 --> 05:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
they were sponsored by a liberal
 
05:02:25.430 --> 05:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
protestant church denomination that my
 
05:02:28.470 --> 05:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
parents and i belonged to
 
05:02:30.868 --> 05:02:30.878 align:start position:0%
it made quite an impression on me
 
05:02:32.230 --> 05:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
to see how
 
05:02:34.628 --> 05:02:34.638 align:start position:0%
this one or that one
 
05:02:37.590 --> 05:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
were compromised forced into violation
 
05:02:39.190 --> 05:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
of their conscience
 
05:02:42.150 --> 05:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
by persons of power
 
05:02:45.750 --> 05:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
the bill before us speaks to one group
 
05:02:48.310 --> 05:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
that i believe could use our help
 
05:02:51.590 --> 05:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
medical professionals
 
05:02:55.190 --> 05:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:56.868 --> 05:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
the bill is the
 
05:03:00.150 --> 05:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
health care freedom of conscience
 
05:03:00.160 --> 05:03:02.070 align:start position:0%

where this was also enacted
 
05:03:11.990 --> 05:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
i've learned it's considered model
 
05:03:12.000 --> 05:03:13.830 align:start position:0%
i've learned it's considered model
legislation

05:03:13.830 --> 05:03:13.840 align:start position:0%

05:03:25.430 --> 05:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
part
 
05:03:28.390 --> 05:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
by reading of the various emails that
 
05:03:31.590 --> 05:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
have come to all of us
 
05:03:33.830 --> 05:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
and while yes
 
05:03:37.990 --> 05:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
the issue of abortion is one issue
 
05:03:39.750 --> 05:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
that faces
 
05:03:42.230 --> 05:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
medical professionals this bill is not
 
05:03:46.470 --> 05:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:48.868 --> 05:03:48.878 align:start position:0%
what about for example
 
05:03:50.550 --> 05:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
the physician
 
05:03:52.788 --> 05:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
who is strongly
 
05:03:53.910 --> 05:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
05:03:53.920 --> 05:03:55.910 align:start position:0%
let's say
encouraged

05:03:55.910 --> 05:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
encouraged
 
05:03:59.270 --> 05:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
to prescribe medicine by the mba
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
who runs the medical facility she works
 
05:04:01.600 --> 05:04:03.670 align:start position:0%
who runs the medical facility she works
for

05:04:03.670 --> 05:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:04:05.670 --> 05:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
follow the money
 
05:04:09.110 --> 05:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
this is a real life example
 
05:04:13.510 --> 05:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:15.670 --> 05:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
what if the conscience
 
05:04:18.470 --> 05:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
of this medical provider says
 
05:04:22.230 --> 05:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
that's not nearly as good for my patient
 
05:04:26.310 --> 05:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:28.150 --> 05:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
you will
 
05:04:29.430 --> 05:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
wink wink
 
05:04:30.948 --> 05:04:30.958 align:start position:0%
nudge nudge
 
05:04:33.990 --> 05:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
just inside the line but the point is
 
05:04:34.000 --> 05:04:35.270 align:start position:0%
just inside the line but the point is
clear

05:04:35.270 --> 05:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
clear
 
05:04:37.830 --> 05:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
prescribe what we tell you
 
05:04:39.750 --> 05:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
always careful
 
05:04:42.628 --> 05:04:42.638 align:start position:0%
that you can't quite nail them on that
 
05:04:44.550 --> 05:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
statement what about the conscience of
 
05:04:46.470 --> 05:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
that person
 
05:04:48.628 --> 05:04:48.638 align:start position:0%

it's not from a blog i think i know what
 
05:05:10.628 --> 05:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
they are but i don't go to blogs
 
05:05:13.510 --> 05:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
as for tv news
 
05:05:15.910 --> 05:05:15.920 align:start position:0%

05:05:19.270 --> 05:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
one news program i will confess and it
 
05:05:21.590 --> 05:05:21.600 align:start position:0%

05:05:35.590 --> 05:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:39.270 --> 05:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
from local colleagues of theirs
 
05:05:41.750 --> 05:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
i like dr parties the shrimp is usually
 
05:05:43.990 --> 05:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
top of the line and there's interesting
 
05:05:44.000 --> 05:05:46.390 align:start position:0%
top of the line and there's interesting
conversation

05:05:46.390 --> 05:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
05:05:48.788 --> 05:05:48.798 align:start position:0%
i also get my information
 
05:05:48.798 --> 05:05:49.670 align:start position:0%
i also get my information
as

05:05:49.670 --> 05:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:05:52.150 --> 05:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
my three and those others go to
 
05:05:55.430 --> 05:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
conferences and come back
 
05:05:57.590 --> 05:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
05:06:00.788 --> 05:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
information out there that i'm not sure
 
05:06:03.110 --> 05:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
i can trust
 
05:06:04.948 --> 05:06:04.958 align:start position:0%
i trust the people that i've just
 
05:06:04.958 --> 05:06:07.350 align:start position:0%
i trust the people that i've just
mentioned

05:06:07.350 --> 05:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
05:06:09.510 --> 05:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
when primary medicine was mostly
 
05:06:13.110 --> 05:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
stand-alone practices
 
05:06:16.948 --> 05:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
the local doctor would set her or his
 
05:06:16.958 --> 05:06:18.868 align:start position:0%
the local doctor would set her or his
policies

05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
policies
 
05:06:20.708 --> 05:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
and they kind of swapped around on
 
05:06:22.550 --> 05:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
certain things and i was a little too
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
young to understand why that doctor
 
05:06:27.590 --> 05:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
on certain things
 
05:06:29.590 --> 05:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
another doctor in town did them but they
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
had some kind of an understanding
 
05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
so the good medical care could continue
 
05:06:37.270 --> 05:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
and yet their rights of conscience it
 
05:06:40.390 --> 05:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
would seem would be protected
 
05:06:42.868 --> 05:06:42.878 align:start position:0%
now most primary care providers work for
 
05:06:44.628 --> 05:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
large groups
 
05:06:48.070 --> 05:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
where the employers make decisions
 
05:06:49.830 --> 05:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
the young physician is three hundred
 
05:06:52.150 --> 05:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in debt and knows
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
better than to rock the system or bite
 
05:06:59.030 --> 05:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:00.708 --> 05:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
we hear laments
 
05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
from numbers of our physician friends
 
05:07:06.230 --> 05:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
and people begging to come to our
 
05:07:08.470 --> 05:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
medical facility because in there some
 
05:07:11.110 --> 05:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
of them are told you have 15 minutes to
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:18.628 --> 05:07:18.638 align:start position:0%
what if the patient needs 28 minutes
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
i know what it was like once to be
 
05:07:23.910 --> 05:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
rushed through something
 
05:07:26.470 --> 05:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
because the next one had to come in
 
05:07:29.270 --> 05:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
because the doctor was told the next one
 
05:07:31.990 --> 05:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
has to come in or the insurance company
 
05:07:34.628 --> 05:07:34.638 align:start position:0%
says you're going to get reimbursed
 
05:07:36.708 --> 05:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
for 15 minutes
 
05:07:38.788 --> 05:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
i know what it's like when we take 28
 
05:07:40.708 --> 05:07:40.718 align:start position:0%
minutes to do it we're a non-profit
 
05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
organization we have bake sales
 
05:07:45.270 --> 05:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
so that we can treat the patient the way
 
05:07:48.230 --> 05:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
the patient needs
 
05:07:48.240 --> 05:07:50.310 align:start position:0%
the patient needs
now

05:07:50.310 --> 05:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:07:51.990 --> 05:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
this is relevant
 
05:07:54.788 --> 05:07:54.798 align:start position:0%
to my bill because
 
05:07:59.110 --> 05:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
physicians are quitting medicine
 
05:08:01.350 --> 05:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons but some of it
 
05:08:03.350 --> 05:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
is i want to be treated as a
 
05:08:06.070 --> 05:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
professional not as an employee of a
 
05:08:09.510 --> 05:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
for-profit organization
 
05:08:12.390 --> 05:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
but also some are quitting
 
05:08:14.070 --> 05:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
some i've talked to
 
05:08:15.590 --> 05:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
because they've been asked to do things
 
05:08:18.628 --> 05:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
that violate their conscience
 
05:08:21.030 --> 05:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
now some email authors objected to the
 
05:08:23.750 --> 05:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
possibility that a doctor would refuse
 
05:08:25.670 --> 05:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
his or her patient
 
05:08:28.230 --> 05:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
some treatment meaning they would not
 
05:08:30.788 --> 05:08:30.798 align:start position:0%
have any care
 
05:08:33.670 --> 05:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
for that person
 
05:08:33.680 --> 05:08:36.470 align:start position:0%
for that person
well

05:08:36.470 --> 05:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:40.310 --> 05:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
as we heard actually articulated in this
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
very committee
 
05:08:44.070 --> 05:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
that if a doctor didn't want to treat
 
05:08:47.190 --> 05:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
somebody for lack of vaccination status
 
05:08:49.750 --> 05:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
another provider could be providing such
 
05:08:51.830 --> 05:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
a thing
 
05:08:54.310 --> 05:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's not that there's one doctor
 
05:08:56.150 --> 05:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
in town
 
05:08:57.910 --> 05:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
and it's not that that doctor is going
 
05:09:00.390 --> 05:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
to say i now refuse to treat you too bad
 
05:09:02.150 --> 05:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
to be you remember they can be
 
05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:08.230 --> 05:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
we know other people in our area who do
 
05:09:10.310 --> 05:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
things that perhaps certain physicians
 
05:09:12.708 --> 05:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
do not wish to do
 
05:09:14.868 --> 05:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
things get done the patient does not
 
05:09:14.878 --> 05:09:15.910 align:start position:0%
things get done the patient does not
suffer

05:09:15.910 --> 05:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
suffer
 
05:09:17.590 --> 05:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
and if it's a case of well there's not
 
05:09:19.350 --> 05:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
continuity of care have you ever heard
 
05:09:21.430 --> 05:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
of a hospitalist
 
05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
our facility was the last facility in
 
05:09:26.390 --> 05:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
south central rockingham county
 
05:09:28.150 --> 05:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
where the doctor would get up at three
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
in the morning trying not to wake me up
 
05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
to go to the hospital because one of our
 
05:09:37.590 --> 05:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:40.390 --> 05:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
hospitalists don't know the patient but
 
05:09:41.830 --> 05:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
they know medicine
 
05:09:43.510 --> 05:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
and so when somebody's in the hospital
 
05:09:45.430 --> 05:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
your family practice doctor probably
 
05:09:52.150 --> 05:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:54.788 --> 05:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
somebody else is there
 
05:09:57.910 --> 05:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
as we've heard in our committee
 
05:10:00.868 --> 05:10:00.878 align:start position:0%
giving what the patient
 
05:10:00.878 --> 05:10:02.708 align:start position:0%
giving what the patient
wants

05:10:02.708 --> 05:10:02.718 align:start position:0%
wants
 
05:10:04.708 --> 05:10:04.718 align:start position:0%
probably needs
 
05:10:07.030 --> 05:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
and honoring the conscience of the
 
05:10:07.040 --> 05:10:09.030 align:start position:0%
and honoring the conscience of the
provider

05:10:09.030 --> 05:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
provider
 
05:10:13.510 --> 05:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:15.670 --> 05:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
i've been told that this bill is not
 
05:10:17.510 --> 05:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
needed because there are provisions in
 
05:10:19.990 --> 05:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
the law now well if it's true
 
05:10:22.788 --> 05:10:22.798 align:start position:0%
then why are some providers finding
 
05:10:26.150 --> 05:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
themselves in serious difficulty with
 
05:10:29.750 --> 05:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:31.990 --> 05:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
someone i asked to provide research on
 
05:10:34.708 --> 05:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
this question told me
 
05:10:38.150 --> 05:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
that only in vermont and colorado
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
are their lacks of the kind of
 
05:10:43.270 --> 05:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
protection we seek here new hampshire
 
05:10:49.030 --> 05:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:51.270 --> 05:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
again back to that list of blue states
 
05:10:53.670 --> 05:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
i'm coming to like much to my surprise
 
05:10:56.470 --> 05:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
and to my humbling
 
05:11:01.670 --> 05:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:05.110 --> 05:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
this is getting a little scary
 
05:11:07.350 --> 05:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
i do not seek to deny a patient what
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
that person truly needs
 
05:11:13.190 --> 05:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
i am trying to recollect those rights of
 
05:11:17.110 --> 05:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
conscience ads i recall from my youth
 
05:11:21.270 --> 05:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
and protect the individual providers
 
05:11:24.390 --> 05:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
from the decisions of some increasingly
 
05:11:26.230 --> 05:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
finance driven
 
05:11:28.868 --> 05:11:28.878 align:start position:0%
big medicine operations
 
05:11:31.910 --> 05:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
and not at the expense of patient care
 
05:11:36.230 --> 05:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:38.390 --> 05:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pearson and
 
05:11:41.270 --> 05:11:41.280 align:start position:0%

05:11:56.390 --> 05:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
you have spoken well
 
05:12:00.948 --> 05:12:00.958 align:start position:0%
eloquently on the issue of the
 
05:12:00.958 --> 05:12:02.628 align:start position:0%
eloquently on the issue of the
pressures

05:12:02.628 --> 05:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
pressures
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
financial pressures and otherwise on the

05:12:14.390 --> 05:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
choices in practice
 
05:12:14.400 --> 05:12:15.270 align:start position:0%
choices in practice
but

05:12:15.270 --> 05:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:12:19.670 --> 05:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
am i clear that this bill in front of us
 
05:12:19.680 --> 05:12:20.948 align:start position:0%
am i clear that this bill in front of us
speaks

05:12:20.948 --> 05:12:20.958 align:start position:0%
speaks
 
05:12:20.958 --> 05:12:22.868 align:start position:0%
speaks
only

05:12:22.868 --> 05:12:22.878 align:start position:0%
only
 
05:12:25.510 --> 05:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
to the issues of
 
05:12:25.520 --> 05:12:27.830 align:start position:0%
to the issues of
provision

05:12:27.830 --> 05:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
provision
 
05:12:30.470 --> 05:12:30.480 align:start position:0%

care surrounding abortions
sterilization

05:12:32.150 --> 05:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
sterilization
 
05:12:34.868 --> 05:12:34.878 align:start position:0%
and artificial contraception and has
 
05:12:36.868 --> 05:12:36.878 align:start position:0%
nothing to do
 
05:12:39.190 --> 05:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
with the pressures that an insurance
 
05:12:41.830 --> 05:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
company brings on a physician when they
 
05:12:45.270 --> 05:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
say thou shalt see a patient for only 15
 
05:12:45.280 --> 05:12:46.470 align:start position:0%
say thou shalt see a patient for only 15
minutes

05:12:46.470 --> 05:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
05:12:51.670 --> 05:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
you are correct and as you seem to do so
 
05:12:53.910 --> 05:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
admirably with my bills
 
05:12:53.920 --> 05:12:55.110 align:start position:0%
admirably with my bills
have

05:12:55.110 --> 05:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:12:57.030 --> 05:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
suggested to me
 
05:12:59.430 --> 05:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh an amendment that i would like to
 
05:13:02.230 --> 05:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
broaden it from abortion i said it's not
 
05:13:04.708 --> 05:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
an abortion bill and you have correctly
 
05:13:06.868 --> 05:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
pointed out what's in the bill
 
05:13:09.350 --> 05:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
i would like to broaden it to
 
05:13:11.590 --> 05:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
matters of conscience
 
05:13:14.628 --> 05:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:18.150 --> 05:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:21.270 --> 05:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
may i suggest that if it is broadened to
 
05:13:23.910 --> 05:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
matters of conscience globally rather
 
05:13:26.470 --> 05:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
than the very specific limits of this
 
05:13:26.480 --> 05:13:27.910 align:start position:0%
than the very specific limits of this
bill

05:13:27.910 --> 05:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:13:29.750 --> 05:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
would you not agree with me that that
 
05:13:31.350 --> 05:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
should be the subject of a further
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
public hearing as nobody who wanted to
 
05:13:36.150 --> 05:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
comment beyond the issue of abortion
 
05:13:37.910 --> 05:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
would have noticed that they needed to
 
05:13:39.990 --> 05:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
be here and say something
 
05:13:43.110 --> 05:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
that would seem fair yes
 
05:13:44.550 --> 05:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weber
 
05:13:46.788 --> 05:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
05:13:48.868 --> 05:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um and
 
05:13:51.350 --> 05:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative pearson um
 
05:13:53.990 --> 05:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your eloquence i uh
 
05:13:56.470 --> 05:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
strongly support the conversation that
 
05:13:58.708 --> 05:13:58.718 align:start position:0%
you have just had with uh the
 
05:14:01.030 --> 05:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative from walpole strongly
 
05:14:02.310 --> 05:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
support that
 
05:14:05.030 --> 05:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
do you believe perhaps sir that at the
 
05:14:08.550 --> 05:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
same time physicians who make choices of
 
05:14:08.560 --> 05:14:09.990 align:start position:0%
same time physicians who make choices of
conscience

05:14:09.990 --> 05:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
05:14:14.150 --> 05:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
need to be protected from those who
 
05:14:16.788 --> 05:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
would punish them
 
05:14:20.390 --> 05:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
for making uh choices of conscience so
 
05:14:22.788 --> 05:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
perhaps if somebody is outside
 
05:14:22.798 --> 05:14:24.150 align:start position:0%
perhaps if somebody is outside
demonstrating

05:14:24.150 --> 05:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
demonstrating
 
05:14:27.190 --> 05:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
against a physician who has acted
 
05:14:29.110 --> 05:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
on matters of conscience
 
05:14:33.350 --> 05:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:35.750 --> 05:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
in what way sir
 
05:14:35.760 --> 05:14:36.628 align:start position:0%
in what way sir
um

05:14:36.628 --> 05:14:36.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:39.510 --> 05:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
i am aware of physicians
 
05:14:39.520 --> 05:14:41.430 align:start position:0%
i am aware of physicians
being

05:14:41.430 --> 05:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:14:41.440 --> 05:14:43.110 align:start position:0%
being
murdered

05:14:43.110 --> 05:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
murdered
 
05:14:46.390 --> 05:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
for their choices of conscience
 
05:14:48.708 --> 05:14:48.718 align:start position:0%
i would be against that
 
05:14:48.718 --> 05:14:49.510 align:start position:0%
i would be against that
um

05:14:49.510 --> 05:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:51.990 --> 05:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
and if the question is picketing outside
 
05:14:54.628 --> 05:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
i support free speech even if it's
 
05:14:57.350 --> 05:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
speech that i do not like
 
05:14:57.360 --> 05:14:58.310 align:start position:0%
speech that i do not like
okay

05:14:58.310 --> 05:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:15:00.310 --> 05:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:15:02.868 --> 05:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative shapiro
 
05:15:04.868 --> 05:15:04.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:15:07.670 --> 05:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question i understand i was a
 
05:15:09.110 --> 05:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
little confused at first and i
 
05:15:11.510 --> 05:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
understand that your intent is to
 
05:15:14.830 --> 05:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
broaden this to other issues that affect
 
05:15:17.830 --> 05:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
um health care providers and certainly
 
05:15:19.430 --> 05:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of them i got the wrong
 
05:15:21.910 --> 05:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
seat here i can never it's like i have a
 
05:15:25.430 --> 05:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
pole in front of me at the boston garden
 
05:15:28.470 --> 05:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
the chair has that when i sit there too
 
05:15:28.480 --> 05:15:29.670 align:start position:0%
the chair has that when i sit there too
yeah

05:15:29.670 --> 05:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:15:29.680 --> 05:15:30.868 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

05:15:30.868 --> 05:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:32.948 --> 05:15:32.958 align:start position:0%
so if we are going to broaden it or even
 
05:15:35.510 --> 05:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
if we aren't going to broaden it
 
05:15:38.788 --> 05:15:38.798 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that there might be
 
05:15:40.708 --> 05:15:40.718 align:start position:0%
as there frequently
 
05:15:40.718 --> 05:15:41.910 align:start position:0%
as there frequently
are

05:15:41.910 --> 05:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:15:41.920 --> 05:15:43.750 align:start position:0%
are
competing

05:15:43.750 --> 05:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
competing
 
05:15:46.708 --> 05:15:46.718 align:start position:0%
goods and in this case between the
 
05:15:49.510 --> 05:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
choice of a medical practitioner
 
05:15:49.520 --> 05:15:50.868 align:start position:0%
choice of a medical practitioner
and

05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:15:53.670 --> 05:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to run a business
 
05:15:55.350 --> 05:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
and there might be some trade-offs here
 
05:15:59.350 --> 05:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
so if i could just give you one example
 
05:15:59.360 --> 05:16:00.230 align:start position:0%
so if i could just give you one example
and

05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:16:01.910 --> 05:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
maybe you could tell me how this might
 
05:16:05.110 --> 05:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:06.948 --> 05:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
certainly there would be more examples
 
05:16:08.868 --> 05:16:08.878 align:start position:0%
if we broadened it but even with even
 
05:16:10.948 --> 05:16:10.958 align:start position:0%
with the way it's written now
 
05:16:15.350 --> 05:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
what if you were a provider who provided
 
05:16:18.070 --> 05:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
services for family planning
 
05:16:20.310 --> 05:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
worked at planned parenthood
 
05:16:22.470 --> 05:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
and you had a religious conversion and
 
05:16:24.868 --> 05:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
decided that you no longer believed in
 
05:16:24.878 --> 05:16:26.550 align:start position:0%
decided that you no longer believed in
um

05:16:26.550 --> 05:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:30.070 --> 05:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:32.868 --> 05:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
that exact case actually came up
 
05:16:35.590 --> 05:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
in a conference that my wife attended
 
05:16:37.590 --> 05:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
and there was someone who did have such
 
05:16:39.590 --> 05:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
a religious conversion
 
05:16:43.350 --> 05:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
and in this particular case that was the
 
05:16:45.910 --> 05:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
change of what the provider would no
 
05:16:47.110 --> 05:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
longer do
 
05:16:49.510 --> 05:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
went to the owners the owner said you're
 
05:16:53.110 --> 05:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
too felt too valuable to lose we have
 
05:16:55.430 --> 05:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
four other doctors here
 
05:16:58.470 --> 05:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
who do not have such a new belief as you
 
05:17:02.070 --> 05:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:03.990 --> 05:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
okay i would just
 
05:17:08.470 --> 05:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:11.430 --> 05:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
that that is a pretty unusual situation
 
05:17:14.550 --> 05:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
and i would also assume to be fair
 
05:17:16.310 --> 05:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
that if somebody had that religious
 
05:17:17.830 --> 05:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
conversion they'd probably leave that
 
05:17:19.830 --> 05:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
job and go find a job somewhere else on
 
05:17:21.270 --> 05:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
their own
 
05:17:23.510 --> 05:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
but if push came to shove
 
05:17:25.270 --> 05:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:17:25.280 --> 05:17:26.550 align:start position:0%
and the
owner

05:17:26.550 --> 05:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
owner
 
05:17:29.990 --> 05:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
or the operator of a medical
 
05:17:30.000 --> 05:17:33.110 align:start position:0%
or the operator of a medical
practice

05:17:33.110 --> 05:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:34.628 --> 05:17:34.638 align:start position:0%
couldn't have
 
05:17:37.030 --> 05:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't insist that someone provides
 
05:17:39.590 --> 05:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
certain services
 
05:17:42.550 --> 05:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be a
 
05:17:44.868 --> 05:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
burden on on a business or a burden on
 
05:17:46.550 --> 05:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
an organization
 
05:17:48.708 --> 05:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
it's kind of curious this year that all
 
05:17:51.270 --> 05:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
of us who one day argue for business
 
05:17:53.190 --> 05:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
argue against it the next day and then
 
05:17:57.910 --> 05:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:00.230 --> 05:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
i'll take that as your answer
 
05:18:02.070 --> 05:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you uh
 
05:18:06.310 --> 05:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:07.910 --> 05:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank grips
 
05:18:10.788 --> 05:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
that appears i'm taking my question
 
05:18:10.798 --> 05:18:11.510 align:start position:0%
that appears i'm taking my question
all

05:18:11.510 --> 05:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:18:13.510 --> 05:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
many bills we've heard
 
05:18:15.190 --> 05:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
before this committee seem to be a
 
05:18:18.070 --> 05:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
balancing act between rights
 
05:18:19.430 --> 05:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
the right to the parents rights of the
 
05:18:19.440 --> 05:18:20.390 align:start position:0%
the right to the parents rights of the
child

05:18:20.390 --> 05:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
child
 
05:18:21.750 --> 05:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
rights of the employer the rights of the
 
05:18:21.760 --> 05:18:23.030 align:start position:0%
rights of the employer the rights of the
employed

05:18:23.030 --> 05:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
employed
 
05:18:25.030 --> 05:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
and it it's a challenge trying to figure
 
05:18:27.830 --> 05:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
out where that line gets drawn
 
05:18:29.590 --> 05:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
in this whole thing
 
05:18:31.590 --> 05:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything about the rights of
 
05:18:33.910 --> 05:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
the patient what i'm trying to get to is
 
05:18:33.920 --> 05:18:36.310 align:start position:0%
the patient what i'm trying to get to is
that

05:18:36.310 --> 05:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:38.948 --> 05:18:38.958 align:start position:0%
if you are going to a provider
 
05:18:40.788 --> 05:18:40.798 align:start position:0%
and they don't want to do the procedure
 
05:18:42.310 --> 05:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
there's nothing here that says the
 
05:18:44.310 --> 05:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
provider should be required
 
05:18:46.470 --> 05:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
to inform the patient where they may go
 
05:18:48.150 --> 05:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
to get the provider you talked about
 
05:18:50.310 --> 05:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
before in a small town there was a way
 
05:18:52.070 --> 05:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
for it to kind of magically work its way
 
05:18:52.080 --> 05:18:53.110 align:start position:0%
for it to kind of magically work its way
through

05:18:53.110 --> 05:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:18:55.030 --> 05:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
but in doing it this way and things have
 
05:18:57.190 --> 05:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
changed now in 2020
 
05:18:59.270 --> 05:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
or 2022.
 
05:19:00.628 --> 05:19:00.638 align:start position:0%
what about the rights of the patient to
 
05:19:02.070 --> 05:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
be informed about where they could
 
05:19:04.550 --> 05:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
possibly go who could help them in a
 
05:19:06.230 --> 05:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
situation where the provider before them
 
05:19:08.550 --> 05:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
is not willing to do it
 
05:19:11.830 --> 05:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
i do know in some cases where a provider
 
05:19:16.310 --> 05:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
has the ability to exercise conscience
 
05:19:18.628 --> 05:19:18.638 align:start position:0%
said providers have
 
05:19:21.910 --> 05:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
said here are places where you could go
 
05:19:23.750 --> 05:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that's universal and it's
 
05:19:25.990 --> 05:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
certainly not in the law but that has
 
05:19:28.150 --> 05:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
been my experience more than it has not
 
05:19:28.160 --> 05:19:29.190 align:start position:0%
been my experience more than it has not
been

05:19:29.190 --> 05:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:19:29.200 --> 05:19:30.470 align:start position:0%
been
follow-up

05:19:30.470 --> 05:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:19:31.990 --> 05:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:19:33.430 --> 05:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
would you be opposed then to an
 
05:19:35.030 --> 05:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that would require the
 
05:19:35.040 --> 05:19:36.230 align:start position:0%
amendment that would require the
provider

05:19:36.230 --> 05:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
provider
 
05:19:38.948 --> 05:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
to exercise that right to inform the
 
05:19:41.590 --> 05:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
patient as part of their ability to
 
05:19:43.750 --> 05:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
object to it to inform the patient there
 
05:19:45.990 --> 05:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
is alternatives so the patient's
 
05:19:47.830 --> 05:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
informed at that point in time not left
 
05:19:51.030 --> 05:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:53.270 --> 05:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
my sympathy is to say i would not be
 
05:19:54.788 --> 05:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
opposed to that i don't want to give a
 
05:19:56.390 --> 05:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
final answer as i work through the
 
05:19:57.750 --> 05:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
amendment but thank you for that
 
05:19:59.670 --> 05:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
suggestion and i don't have a pen down
 
05:20:00.948 --> 05:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
here so i hope you're all writing it
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
down for me
 
05:20:05.110 --> 05:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:20:07.110 --> 05:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative canuck thank
 
05:20:09.110 --> 05:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
you very much sort of a two-parter one
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
is if we're going to broaden it
 
05:20:13.990 --> 05:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
then would you agree that or i should
 
05:20:14.000 --> 05:20:14.868 align:start position:0%
then would you agree that or i should
ask

05:20:14.868 --> 05:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
ask
 
05:20:16.788 --> 05:20:16.798 align:start position:0%
should it be broadened such it would
 
05:20:18.948 --> 05:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
protect a healthcare worker who might
 
05:20:20.628 --> 05:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
work at a facility
 
05:20:22.788 --> 05:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
which already prohibits abortion
 
05:20:24.868 --> 05:20:24.878 align:start position:0%
sterilization and contraception that
 
05:20:26.628 --> 05:20:26.638 align:start position:0%
would give them the right to do those
 
05:20:28.310 --> 05:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
procedures and still work at that
 
05:20:28.320 --> 05:20:29.990 align:start position:0%
procedures and still work at that
facility

05:20:29.990 --> 05:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
facility
 
05:20:31.270 --> 05:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
in other words they would still be able
 
05:20:32.628 --> 05:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
to follow their conscience if they think
 
05:20:34.470 --> 05:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
that is proper medical care and their
 
05:20:36.948 --> 05:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
institution normally does not allow that
 
05:20:39.510 --> 05:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
would that be acceptable to add to this
 
05:20:42.230 --> 05:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
as well when broadening it
 
05:20:44.708 --> 05:20:44.718 align:start position:0%
wow representative kirk was right about
 
05:20:48.628 --> 05:20:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:50.470 --> 05:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
let me think about that one too that
 
05:20:52.628 --> 05:20:52.638 align:start position:0%
that is totally not crossed my mind i
 
05:20:55.030 --> 05:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
would have to think about it
 
05:20:57.510 --> 05:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
okay seriously hoping to follow up a
 
05:20:59.750 --> 05:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative and follow up
 
05:21:01.590 --> 05:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
another hypothetical
 
05:21:03.030 --> 05:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
having to do with emergency care because
 
05:21:04.948 --> 05:21:04.958 align:start position:0%
where i live indeed
 
05:21:06.788 --> 05:21:06.798 align:start position:0%
for certain things there is only one
 
05:21:09.190 --> 05:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
provider so let's say a woman comes in
 
05:21:11.590 --> 05:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy
 
05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
it is late at night
 
05:21:15.110 --> 05:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
they are in
 
05:21:16.868 --> 05:21:16.878 align:start position:0%
the memorial hospital in conway the
 
05:21:19.110 --> 05:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
closest other facility is going to be at
 
05:21:21.430 --> 05:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
least an hour away and the person on
 
05:21:23.590 --> 05:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
call does not it's against their
 
05:21:23.600 --> 05:21:24.708 align:start position:0%
call does not it's against their
conscience

05:21:24.708 --> 05:21:24.718 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
05:21:24.718 --> 05:21:25.670 align:start position:0%
conscience
to

05:21:25.670 --> 05:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:21:28.310 --> 05:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
care for that patient and treat that
 
05:21:30.708 --> 05:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
ectopic pregnancy and that person will
 
05:21:33.190 --> 05:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
die before they get to huggins hospital
 
05:21:35.030 --> 05:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything here i don't i'm
 
05:21:36.868 --> 05:21:36.878 align:start position:0%
not sure that i saw anything about
 
05:21:39.030 --> 05:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
emergency care would
 
05:21:40.708 --> 05:21:40.718 align:start position:0%
that would prohibit the person from
 
05:21:43.030 --> 05:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
violating this or shall i say would this
 
05:21:45.110 --> 05:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
bill immunize that provider from the
 
05:21:47.030 --> 05:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
clear-cut malpractice that they would
 
05:21:49.030 --> 05:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
have done by not operating on that
 
05:21:50.788 --> 05:21:50.798 align:start position:0%
patient at two in the morning i would
 
05:21:53.190 --> 05:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
suggest my notetakers add that to the
 
05:21:56.070 --> 05:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
list because my statement would be in
 
05:21:57.990 --> 05:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
in situations where you're the sole
 
05:22:01.030 --> 05:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
provider and other alternatives are
 
05:22:01.040 --> 05:22:02.708 align:start position:0%
provider and other alternatives are
unrealistically

05:22:02.708 --> 05:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
unrealistically
 
05:22:05.110 --> 05:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
far away
 
05:22:07.030 --> 05:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
don't go there to work
 
05:22:08.470 --> 05:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
well then could i maybe make one more
 
05:22:10.230 --> 05:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up because that was for emergency
 
05:22:11.830 --> 05:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
care but actually that same situation
 
05:22:14.230 --> 05:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
was unrealistically far away
 
05:22:14.240 --> 05:22:15.110 align:start position:0%
was unrealistically far away
again

05:22:15.110 --> 05:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:22:17.270 --> 05:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh for many of us we have to travel a
 
05:22:19.110 --> 05:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
very long way up in my neck of the woods
 
05:22:21.430 --> 05:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
to obtain health care and so it might
 
05:22:23.510 --> 05:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
not even be an emergency and you might
 
05:22:26.390 --> 05:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
have to travel for an hour and a half to
 
05:22:28.070 --> 05:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
05:22:30.150 --> 05:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
fill a prescription if somebody has an
 
05:22:32.150 --> 05:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
aversion to something or well probably
 
05:22:34.150 --> 05:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
prescription not there's more pharmacies
 
05:22:37.030 --> 05:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
but for other care because the only
 
05:22:37.040 --> 05:22:38.470 align:start position:0%
but for other care because the only
provider

05:22:38.470 --> 05:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
provider
 
05:22:40.948 --> 05:22:40.958 align:start position:0%
might not have met a problem i think
 
05:22:42.708 --> 05:22:42.718 align:start position:0%
maybe you just confine it to emergency i
 
05:22:42.718 --> 05:22:44.788 align:start position:0%
maybe you just confine it to emergency i
suppose

05:22:44.788 --> 05:22:44.798 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
05:22:48.310 --> 05:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
i like that yeah representative leon has
 
05:22:50.708 --> 05:22:50.718 align:start position:0%
some guidance for us on that subject
 
05:22:52.708 --> 05:22:52.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh would you
 
05:22:55.430 --> 05:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
believe that on page one
 
05:22:58.390 --> 05:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
line 15 it says that an abortion is not
 
05:23:01.590 --> 05:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
defined as removing an ectopic pregnancy
 
05:23:03.830 --> 05:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
so that already is something that right
 
05:23:05.750 --> 05:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
now is carved out and there's there it's
 
05:23:08.548 --> 05:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
fine for somebody to uh
 
05:23:10.548 --> 05:23:10.558 align:start position:0%
it seems that that a life-saving
 
05:23:11.910 --> 05:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
treatment ever a ruptured ectopic
 
05:23:11.920 --> 05:23:13.510 align:start position:0%
treatment ever a ruptured ectopic
pregnancy

05:23:13.510 --> 05:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
05:23:13.520 --> 05:23:14.470 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
wouldn't

05:23:14.470 --> 05:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
05:23:16.150 --> 05:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
fall underneath that conscience i'm not
 
05:23:17.750 --> 05:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
sure if i'm understanding that correctly
 
05:23:20.708 --> 05:23:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:21.990 --> 05:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's in
 
05:23:24.230 --> 05:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
in the section on page one from lines
 
05:23:26.230 --> 05:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
twelve to sixteen that specifically says
 
05:23:29.030 --> 05:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
ectopic pregnancy on line 15
 
05:23:34.070 --> 05:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:35.750 --> 05:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
but that's just the definition a person
 
05:23:37.350 --> 05:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
might still object the provider might
 
05:23:39.110 --> 05:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
still object they might call that an
 
05:23:41.590 --> 05:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
abortion even though we know it isn't
 
05:23:43.190 --> 05:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
okay we'll leave that for our discussion
 
05:23:45.670 --> 05:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
at the end do we have um
 
05:23:47.110 --> 05:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
plenty of others that we need to hear
 
05:23:48.868 --> 05:23:48.878 align:start position:0%
from so with your patients selected now
 
05:23:52.830 --> 05:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:56.310 --> 05:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
05:23:56.320 --> 05:23:57.430 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman and thank you
chairman

05:23:57.430 --> 05:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:24:00.868 --> 05:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:02.948 --> 05:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
how do you take into account those
 
05:24:05.670 --> 05:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
individuals who have no conscience at
 
05:24:05.680 --> 05:24:09.510 align:start position:0%
individuals who have no conscience at
all

05:24:09.510 --> 05:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:11.430 --> 05:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
dr makai i hope they would not have
 
05:24:16.150 --> 05:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:17.830 --> 05:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your brief response and
 
05:24:17.840 --> 05:24:21.270 align:start position:0%
thank you for your brief response and
guidance

05:24:21.270 --> 05:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:23.430 --> 05:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
let's see we have uh
 
05:24:25.590 --> 05:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative woods please
 
05:24:27.750 --> 05:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and uh thank you
 
05:24:29.830 --> 05:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair for taking my
 
05:24:32.948 --> 05:24:32.958 align:start position:0%
question uh are you aware of the ama
 
05:24:34.310 --> 05:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
code of ethics
 
05:24:37.350 --> 05:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh and its comment which
 
05:24:37.360 --> 05:24:38.948 align:start position:0%
uh and its comment which
addresses

05:24:38.948 --> 05:24:38.958 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
05:24:40.390 --> 05:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
the point that you're trying to do is
 
05:24:43.190 --> 05:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
make it a more general form as you know
 
05:24:46.390 --> 05:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
or are you aware that the rsa already
 
05:24:49.030 --> 05:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
embeds the ama's code of meth code of
 
05:24:50.788 --> 05:24:50.798 align:start position:0%
ethics as the guideline for which
 
05:24:52.150 --> 05:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
physicians are
 
05:24:55.190 --> 05:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:58.310 --> 05:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
yes but insufficiently it would seem i
 
05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
would appreciate you shooting me
 
05:25:02.150 --> 05:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
something on that but the question
 
05:25:04.628 --> 05:25:04.638 align:start position:0%
remains why then are people getting in
 
05:25:06.230 --> 05:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
trouble with their
 
05:25:09.270 --> 05:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
their uh employers
 
05:25:13.430 --> 05:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
that i'll just uh just to read
 
05:25:15.750 --> 05:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
a physician may decline to establish a
 
05:25:17.510 --> 05:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
patient physician relationship with a
 
05:25:19.030 --> 05:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
prospective patient
 
05:25:21.830 --> 05:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
or provide specific care to an existing
 
05:25:23.830 --> 05:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
patient in certain limited circumstances
 
05:25:25.350 --> 05:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
that list several
 
05:25:26.788 --> 05:25:26.798 align:start position:0%
and in there is
 
05:25:30.070 --> 05:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
or is incompatible with a physician's
 
05:25:33.510 --> 05:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
deeply held personal religious
 
05:25:36.788 --> 05:25:36.798 align:start position:0%
or moral beliefs in keeping with ethics
 
05:25:40.708 --> 05:25:40.718 align:start position:0%
guidance on exercise of conscience
 
05:25:42.230 --> 05:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
so in terms of
 
05:25:43.990 --> 05:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
you're trying to expand this in a more
 
05:25:44.000 --> 05:25:45.110 align:start position:0%
you're trying to expand this in a more
general

05:25:45.110 --> 05:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
general
 
05:25:47.590 --> 05:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
conscience manner that seems like it's
 
05:25:49.270 --> 05:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
already covered
 
05:25:51.110 --> 05:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
and might be something to refer back to
 
05:25:52.310 --> 05:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
05:25:55.990 --> 05:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:57.830 --> 05:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
i really like it when my friends help my
 
05:26:01.750 --> 05:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:07.350 --> 05:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you again and i i have a couple of
 
05:26:08.948 --> 05:26:08.958 align:start position:0%
other situations that i'd like to
 
05:26:10.390 --> 05:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
inquire about
 
05:26:13.830 --> 05:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh one would be
 
05:26:15.830 --> 05:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
what about
 
05:26:18.230 --> 05:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
you spoke of when
 
05:26:21.190 --> 05:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
somebody had a conscientious objection
 
05:26:23.030 --> 05:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
and there were four other members in the
 
05:26:24.548 --> 05:26:24.558 align:start position:0%
practice who could take care of the
 
05:26:24.558 --> 05:26:25.670 align:start position:0%
practice who could take care of the
issue

05:26:25.670 --> 05:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:26:28.310 --> 05:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
my concern would be what about the
 
05:26:31.350 --> 05:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
person who is employed by
 
05:26:33.350 --> 05:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
one of the reproductive health care
 
05:26:37.350 --> 05:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
centers whose business
 
05:26:39.270 --> 05:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
focuses on
 
05:26:41.190 --> 05:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
reproductive health care
 
05:26:42.948 --> 05:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
both from the
 
05:26:45.670 --> 05:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
point of view of promoting
 
05:26:48.390 --> 05:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
healthy pregnancies and also from the
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
point of view of providing
 
05:26:54.310 --> 05:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
people with legal
 
05:26:54.320 --> 05:26:56.230 align:start position:0%
people with legal
alternatives

05:26:56.230 --> 05:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
05:26:58.548 --> 05:26:58.558 align:start position:0%
when their reproductive choices are
 
05:26:58.558 --> 05:27:00.868 align:start position:0%
when their reproductive choices are
different

05:27:00.868 --> 05:27:00.878 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:27:04.230 --> 05:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:06.868 --> 05:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
would this bill not
 
05:27:09.430 --> 05:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
require if somebody working there
 
05:27:09.440 --> 05:27:10.390 align:start position:0%
require if somebody working there
underwent

05:27:10.390 --> 05:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
underwent
 
05:27:12.868 --> 05:27:12.878 align:start position:0%
a conversion and decided that they could
 
05:27:16.150 --> 05:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
no longer prescribe
 
05:27:19.830 --> 05:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
birth control or aid in the performance
 
05:27:21.270 --> 05:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
of abortions
 
05:27:23.510 --> 05:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
would this not require them to keep that
 
05:27:25.190 --> 05:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
person on and pay them even though they
 
05:27:27.510 --> 05:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
were unable to perform any of the core
 
05:27:29.750 --> 05:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
functions of the job that they were
 
05:27:33.350 --> 05:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
hired for i should hope not
 
05:27:35.510 --> 05:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to speak to
 
05:27:35.520 --> 05:27:36.948 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to speak to
is

05:27:36.948 --> 05:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:27:39.510 --> 05:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
the situation of a provider
 
05:27:41.910 --> 05:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
where occasionally this comes up
 
05:27:45.270 --> 05:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
but but as a follow-up mr chairman
 
05:27:46.310 --> 05:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
may i
 
05:27:48.310 --> 05:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
you may follow up once
 
05:27:50.390 --> 05:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay i have a whole nother question but
 
05:27:53.190 --> 05:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
this calls for a follow-up
 
05:27:56.030 --> 05:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
on page 2 uh
 
05:27:58.788 --> 05:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
31-35 there's an anti-discrimination
 
05:27:58.798 --> 05:28:00.948 align:start position:0%
31-35 there's an anti-discrimination
clause

05:28:00.948 --> 05:28:00.958 align:start position:0%
clause
 
05:28:03.750 --> 05:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
that i wonder if it would not require
 
05:28:05.990 --> 05:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
that person to be kept on staff
 
05:28:08.310 --> 05:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
indefinitely even though they no longer
 
05:28:10.470 --> 05:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
provide any of the core functions of the
 
05:28:12.548 --> 05:28:12.558 align:start position:0%
job they were hired for i would be quite
 
05:28:15.110 --> 05:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
happy to rewrite that thank you for that
 
05:28:18.230 --> 05:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
reason if that is the core or a
 
05:28:21.110 --> 05:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
serious percentage of what that facility
 
05:28:21.120 --> 05:28:22.470 align:start position:0%
serious percentage of what that facility
does

05:28:22.470 --> 05:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:28:24.070 --> 05:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
then why are you working there it must
 
05:28:25.830 --> 05:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
be painful for you to go to work and see
 
05:28:28.310 --> 05:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
what's going on why would you
 
05:28:31.110 --> 05:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
cash your paycheck under false pretenses
 
05:28:33.270 --> 05:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
no i i'm with you i appreciate that
 
05:28:34.628 --> 05:28:34.638 align:start position:0%
point thank you
 
05:28:37.110 --> 05:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
and i will hold my other
 
05:28:39.990 --> 05:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh for instance for another time
 
05:28:42.548 --> 05:28:42.558 align:start position:0%
yes just a little later on we got 12 uh
 
05:28:44.788 --> 05:28:44.798 align:start position:0%
individuals to hear from uh but first is
 
05:28:47.430 --> 05:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
a representative shapiro
 
05:28:50.230 --> 05:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman um
 
05:28:51.990 --> 05:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
i know you accused me of defending
 
05:28:54.708 --> 05:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
businesses but i just wanna i just wanna
 
05:28:57.430 --> 05:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
i was complimenting you sir i don't
 
05:28:59.270 --> 05:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
i just wanna pursue this a little bit
 
05:29:01.110 --> 05:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
more and this is a this is a question
 
05:29:02.628 --> 05:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
but it's really
 
05:29:02.638 --> 05:29:03.910 align:start position:0%
but it's really
um

05:29:03.910 --> 05:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:06.150 --> 05:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
a suggestion of something to think about
 
05:29:06.160 --> 05:29:07.110 align:start position:0%
a suggestion of something to think about
and

05:29:07.110 --> 05:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:29:10.470 --> 05:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
since you talked about broadening
 
05:29:12.788 --> 05:29:12.798 align:start position:0%
the freedom of conscience
 
05:29:15.110 --> 05:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
and since one of the examples where you
 
05:29:17.830 --> 05:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
used was how we know that
 
05:29:19.670 --> 05:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
practitioners have
 
05:29:21.590 --> 05:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
experienced speed ups in the way they
 
05:29:23.750 --> 05:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
work and i personally am very
 
05:29:26.310 --> 05:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
sympathetic on this issue i know
 
05:29:28.708 --> 05:29:28.718 align:start position:0%
lots of people who've left the field
 
05:29:31.110 --> 05:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
because at some point it changed so
 
05:29:33.590 --> 05:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
dramatically that they felt they were no
 
05:29:35.590 --> 05:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
longer able to really
 
05:29:37.510 --> 05:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
be present with patients anymore they
 
05:29:39.190 --> 05:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
were thinking about the medical record
 
05:29:40.230 --> 05:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
and they were thinking of all the
 
05:29:42.548 --> 05:29:42.558 align:start position:0%
paperwork they had to fill out so
 
05:29:43.990 --> 05:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
i think it would be great if something
 
05:29:46.948 --> 05:29:46.958 align:start position:0%
could be done about this but i guess i'm
 
05:29:49.510 --> 05:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
one my question is if you were to
 
05:29:51.190 --> 05:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
broaden it
 
05:29:54.868 --> 05:29:54.878 align:start position:0%
how would these situations be parsed
 
05:29:57.430 --> 05:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
05:30:00.070 --> 05:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
the business is right or in some cases
 
05:30:02.708 --> 05:30:02.718 align:start position:0%
the businesses need financial need to
 
05:30:04.470 --> 05:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
stay in business because they're under a
 
05:30:06.150 --> 05:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
lot of pressure too
 
05:30:07.430 --> 05:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:30:10.150 --> 05:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
practitioners right of conscience or
 
05:30:11.910 --> 05:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
really the right to just practice in a
 
05:30:14.390 --> 05:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
humane reasonable way
 
05:30:14.400 --> 05:30:15.510 align:start position:0%
humane reasonable way
if

05:30:15.510 --> 05:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:30:17.750 --> 05:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
anyway my question is might something be
 
05:30:19.670 --> 05:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
put in the bill that would help people
 
05:30:23.190 --> 05:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
negotiate those kinds of situations
 
05:30:25.990 --> 05:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that completely revising
 
05:30:28.150 --> 05:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
how we practice medicine in this country
 
05:30:30.070 --> 05:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
is a little bit bigger than i want to
 
05:30:30.080 --> 05:30:31.430 align:start position:0%
is a little bit bigger than i want to
tackle

05:30:31.430 --> 05:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
tackle
 
05:30:33.430 --> 05:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
um but i'd love to be part of a work
 
05:30:34.788 --> 05:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
group that did
 
05:30:36.628 --> 05:30:36.638 align:start position:0%
in terms of counseling which was not
 
05:30:38.150 --> 05:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
part of your question but part of your
 
05:30:38.160 --> 05:30:39.910 align:start position:0%
part of your question but part of your
prelude

05:30:39.910 --> 05:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
prelude
 
05:30:42.470 --> 05:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's another issue too that could be
 
05:30:45.270 --> 05:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
addressed in terms of time blocks that
 
05:30:48.310 --> 05:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
would be another issue too i would like
 
05:30:51.510 --> 05:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
this bill as significantly rewritten now
 
05:30:55.670 --> 05:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
to address procedures
 
05:30:56.788 --> 05:30:56.798 align:start position:0%
thank you but thank you for the
 
05:30:59.030 --> 05:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
suggestions this sounds like some good
 
05:31:02.070 --> 05:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
things to do over the summer thank you
 
05:31:12.788 --> 05:31:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:14.788 --> 05:31:14.798 align:start position:0%
as usual the one guy that has problems
 
05:31:17.430 --> 05:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
with the microphone right
 
05:31:19.190 --> 05:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh on page two
 
05:31:22.070 --> 05:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh line 27
 
05:31:24.548 --> 05:31:24.558 align:start position:0%
is a section that seems to absolve
 
05:31:26.788 --> 05:31:26.798 align:start position:0%
the practitioner from any civil or
 
05:31:28.548 --> 05:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
criminal liability
 
05:31:29.990 --> 05:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
for any
 
05:31:32.070 --> 05:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
action or lack of action that they take
 
05:31:34.390 --> 05:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
with regard to any of these issues
 
05:31:35.670 --> 05:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
but then again
 
05:31:35.680 --> 05:31:37.670 align:start position:0%
but then again
on

05:31:37.670 --> 05:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:31:41.030 --> 05:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
the third page under civil remedies
 
05:31:42.548 --> 05:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
we have a number of different civil
 
05:31:44.628 --> 05:31:44.638 align:start position:0%
remedies that can be taken now the low
 
05:31:47.190 --> 05:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
civil remedies only apply
 
05:31:49.590 --> 05:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
to the institution or health care
 
05:31:49.600 --> 05:31:50.470 align:start position:0%
to the institution or health care
provider

05:31:50.470 --> 05:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
provider
 
05:31:52.310 --> 05:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
health care company
 
05:31:54.310 --> 05:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
that does it and
 
05:31:55.590 --> 05:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
even though the
 
05:31:55.600 --> 05:31:56.628 align:start position:0%
even though the
the

05:31:56.628 --> 05:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:31:58.948 --> 05:31:58.958 align:start position:0%
provider themselves is civilly protected
 
05:32:00.548 --> 05:32:00.558 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:32:03.270 --> 05:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
accurate am i assuming that these civil
 
05:32:05.190 --> 05:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
remedies only apply
 
05:32:07.030 --> 05:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
to the company that operates the
 
05:32:08.548 --> 05:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
facility not
 
05:32:10.788 --> 05:32:10.798 align:start position:0%
the practitioner that that
 
05:32:10.798 --> 05:32:11.830 align:start position:0%
the practitioner that that
refused

05:32:11.830 --> 05:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
refused
 
05:32:14.470 --> 05:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
was unable to do it my understanding is
 
05:32:16.868 --> 05:32:16.878 align:start position:0%
whoever is punished
 
05:32:18.868 --> 05:32:18.878 align:start position:0%
for being forced
 
05:32:21.030 --> 05:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
to do an act against conscience whether
 
05:32:21.040 --> 05:32:21.830 align:start position:0%
to do an act against conscience whether
that

05:32:21.830 --> 05:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:32:23.990 --> 05:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
however that punishment is being fired
 
05:32:25.590 --> 05:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
being whatever
 
05:32:27.590 --> 05:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
that is the one who has
 
05:32:30.150 --> 05:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
a civil case
 
05:32:31.830 --> 05:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
that would be my assumption if you
 
05:32:33.990 --> 05:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
suffered because of a violation of this
 
05:32:34.000 --> 05:32:35.510 align:start position:0%
suffered because of a violation of this
law

05:32:35.510 --> 05:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:32:37.190 --> 05:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
you're the one
 
05:32:39.110 --> 05:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
who gets
 
05:32:43.590 --> 05:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:45.670 --> 05:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
if that is not well written i'd be happy
 
05:32:47.510 --> 05:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
to look at that
 
05:32:50.230 --> 05:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
i i i probably the last one that could
 
05:32:51.910 --> 05:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
really suggest how you'd write it any
 
05:32:53.350 --> 05:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
clearer and i think you should be
 
05:32:55.430 --> 05:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
applauded but make it as clear as you
 
05:32:57.750 --> 05:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
did however i can still see a little bit
 
05:33:00.230 --> 05:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
of a problem here where
 
05:33:02.310 --> 05:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
a person
 
05:33:04.070 --> 05:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
has this one section that says they're
 
05:33:05.670 --> 05:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
protected as long as they're acting
 
05:33:07.830 --> 05:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
based on their conscience did not do
 
05:33:07.840 --> 05:33:09.910 align:start position:0%
based on their conscience did not do
something

05:33:09.910 --> 05:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:33:10.868 --> 05:33:10.878 align:start position:0%
and then how do you make the
 
05:33:12.470 --> 05:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
determination that they had a right to
 
05:33:14.788 --> 05:33:14.798 align:start position:0%
do that at the time they did
 
05:33:17.750 --> 05:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
versus the company's pressure to do it
 
05:33:17.760 --> 05:33:21.350 align:start position:0%
versus the company's pressure to do it
anyway

05:33:21.350 --> 05:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:23.270 --> 05:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not making myself clear if
 
05:33:26.390 --> 05:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
the company harmed materially
 
05:33:28.150 --> 05:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
the practitioner
 
05:33:31.750 --> 05:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
by firing demotion whatever
 
05:33:34.948 --> 05:33:34.958 align:start position:0%
then that person thus punished
 
05:33:36.548 --> 05:33:36.558 align:start position:0%
would have recourse
 
05:33:38.628 --> 05:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
so it would be a practitioner i believe
 
05:33:38.638 --> 05:33:39.750 align:start position:0%
so it would be a practitioner i believe
so

05:33:39.750 --> 05:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:33:39.760 --> 05:33:40.470 align:start position:0%
so
the

05:33:40.470 --> 05:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:33:43.190 --> 05:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
client not serve though no no the the
 
05:33:45.750 --> 05:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
the person who's being punished gets
 
05:33:47.910 --> 05:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
recourse the recourse may be against the
 
05:33:56.628 --> 05:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:58.230 --> 05:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
i guess she answered my question the
 
05:34:00.548 --> 05:34:00.558 align:start position:0%
client the client or the recipient of
 
05:34:04.948 --> 05:34:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:08.070 --> 05:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
only the practitioner of the company
 
05:34:09.590 --> 05:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill is about that's
 
05:34:11.190 --> 05:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
not to say there aren't other issues
 
05:34:12.948 --> 05:34:12.958 align:start position:0%
that could be addressed on other
 
05:34:14.788 --> 05:34:14.798 align:start position:0%
occasions this
 
05:34:18.310 --> 05:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
bill is primarily to protect the rights
 
05:34:20.390 --> 05:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
of a medical professional who is acting
 
05:34:22.708 --> 05:34:22.718 align:start position:0%
according to his or her conscience
 
05:34:24.310 --> 05:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
and this teeth in there because a lot
 
05:34:26.548 --> 05:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
without teeth doesn't work
 
05:34:28.310 --> 05:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you
 
05:34:31.030 --> 05:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions from members for
 
05:34:34.470 --> 05:34:34.480 align:start position:0%

about it with
 
05:35:22.390 --> 05:35:22.400 align:start position:0%

i want to say one thing of my own i want
 
05:35:34.788 --> 05:35:34.798 align:start position:0%
to respond to a couple of things i've
 
05:35:35.910 --> 05:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
i've heard
 
05:35:37.990 --> 05:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
so the first one is part one article
 
05:35:38.000 --> 05:35:39.190 align:start position:0%
so the first one is part one article
four

05:35:39.190 --> 05:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
four
 
05:35:41.270 --> 05:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire constitution rights
 
05:35:43.750 --> 05:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
of conscience unalienable
 
05:35:45.990 --> 05:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
among the natural rights some are of
 
05:35:49.110 --> 05:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
their very nature unalienable because no
 
05:35:52.230 --> 05:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
equivalent no equivalent can be given
 
05:35:52.240 --> 05:35:53.350 align:start position:0%
equivalent no equivalent can be given
for

05:35:53.350 --> 05:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:35:54.708 --> 05:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
or received
 
05:35:56.548 --> 05:35:56.558 align:start position:0%
for them
 
05:35:58.230 --> 05:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
of this kind
 
05:36:00.390 --> 05:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
are the rights of conscience
 
05:36:02.390 --> 05:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
this sets the rights of conscience
 
05:36:02.400 --> 05:36:04.788 align:start position:0%
this sets the rights of conscience
above

05:36:04.788 --> 05:36:04.798 align:start position:0%
above
 
05:36:07.270 --> 05:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
almost all of our other rights
 
05:36:08.948 --> 05:36:08.958 align:start position:0%
and i hear that respect here in this
 
05:36:11.030 --> 05:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee and i'm really excited to hear
 
05:36:11.040 --> 05:36:11.750 align:start position:0%
committee and i'm really excited to hear
it

05:36:11.750 --> 05:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:36:13.670 --> 05:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
everybody that i've heard so far said
 
05:36:15.270 --> 05:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
well we agree with the intent of the
 
05:36:15.280 --> 05:36:16.868 align:start position:0%
well we agree with the intent of the
bill

05:36:16.868 --> 05:36:16.878 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:36:20.548 --> 05:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
when i suggested the bill to chairman
 
05:36:20.558 --> 05:36:22.788 align:start position:0%
when i suggested the bill to chairman
pearson

05:36:22.788 --> 05:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
pearson
 
05:36:24.708 --> 05:36:24.718 align:start position:0%
he said
 
05:36:27.190 --> 05:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
i wanted a broader bill
 
05:36:29.030 --> 05:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
he said no we should just stay focused
 
05:36:30.470 --> 05:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
on this one thing we're going to hear
 
05:36:32.788 --> 05:36:32.798 align:start position:0%
all kinds of other things
 
05:36:34.310 --> 05:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming
 
05:36:35.990 --> 05:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
session and i'm sure you've heard some
 
05:36:37.430 --> 05:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
of those a lot of them having to do with
 
05:36:37.440 --> 05:36:40.310 align:start position:0%
of those a lot of them having to do with
vaccinations

05:36:40.310 --> 05:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
05:36:42.548 --> 05:36:42.558 align:start position:0%
we chose to make this bill very narrow
 
05:36:45.030 --> 05:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
and i encourage you to leave it very
 
05:36:45.040 --> 05:36:46.070 align:start position:0%
and i encourage you to leave it very
narrow

05:36:46.070 --> 05:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
narrow
 
05:36:48.390 --> 05:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
the broader you try to make it
 
05:36:50.948 --> 05:36:50.958 align:start position:0%
the more objections there will be
 
05:36:53.190 --> 05:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
and the fewer cases
 
05:36:56.548 --> 05:36:56.558 align:start position:0%
where it would actually apply
 
05:36:58.470 --> 05:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
for example we talked about it was
 
05:37:00.070 --> 05:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the questioning about was
 
05:37:02.628 --> 05:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
what if somebody goes to cmc or somebody
 
05:37:04.708 --> 05:37:04.718 align:start position:0%
works for planned parenthood
 
05:37:08.708 --> 05:37:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:10.150 --> 05:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
05:37:12.788 --> 05:37:12.798 align:start position:0%
well that's a real problem but in such a
 
05:37:14.788 --> 05:37:14.798 align:start position:0%
case i want you to think about what the
 
05:37:18.470 --> 05:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
right of conscience really is
 
05:37:21.830 --> 05:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
because if it is this right that is so
 
05:37:25.350 --> 05:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
powerfully expressed in our constitution
 
05:37:27.510 --> 05:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
then it's powerful enough to cause one
 
05:37:30.070 --> 05:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
to leverage employment
 
05:37:30.080 --> 05:37:32.470 align:start position:0%
to leverage employment
voluntarily

05:37:32.470 --> 05:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
voluntarily
 
05:37:34.948 --> 05:37:34.958 align:start position:0%
because the conscience itself will act
 
05:37:36.628 --> 05:37:36.638 align:start position:0%
on the person like it did on abby
 
05:37:39.510 --> 05:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
johnson when she was a medical director
 
05:37:42.310 --> 05:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
for planned parenthood in texas
 
05:37:44.070 --> 05:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
and when she saw what they were actually
 
05:37:46.070 --> 05:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
doing at planned parenthood her
 
05:37:48.868 --> 05:37:48.878 align:start position:0%
conscience drove her
 
05:37:50.548 --> 05:37:50.558 align:start position:0%
to become the pro-life advocate she's
 
05:37:52.868 --> 05:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
been for the past couple decades
 
05:37:54.548 --> 05:37:54.558 align:start position:0%
her conscience drove her to that that's
 
05:37:56.628 --> 05:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
what conscience does
 
05:37:58.868 --> 05:37:58.878 align:start position:0%
so we don't really have to worry
 
05:38:01.190 --> 05:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
about one who comes to
 
05:38:03.990 --> 05:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
a new feeling of conscience
 
05:38:05.670 --> 05:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
while they're employed they'll leave
 
05:38:07.430 --> 05:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
they'll take care of that themselves the
 
05:38:10.310 --> 05:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
same thing with the doctor who's on call
 
05:38:13.030 --> 05:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
right it's wonderful to see that the ama
 
05:38:14.948 --> 05:38:14.958 align:start position:0%
recognizes the importance of the right
 
05:38:17.030 --> 05:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
of conscience but that doesn't protect
 
05:38:19.510 --> 05:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
anybody in our real world
 
05:38:21.510 --> 05:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's just a guideline that's supposed to
 
05:38:23.270 --> 05:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
be followed
 
05:38:23.280 --> 05:38:24.310 align:start position:0%
be followed
so

05:38:24.310 --> 05:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:38:26.788 --> 05:38:26.798 align:start position:0%
it's a good expression of why we need
 
05:38:27.990 --> 05:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:38:29.830 --> 05:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll leave it at that webwelper
 
05:38:32.230 --> 05:38:32.240 align:start position:0%

is there a problem
 
05:40:00.390 --> 05:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes
 
05:40:01.990 --> 05:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to quote
 
05:40:04.150 --> 05:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
if you have qualms about abortion
 
05:40:06.788 --> 05:40:06.798 align:start position:0%
sterilization and birth control
 
05:40:10.310 --> 05:40:10.320 align:start position:0%

the result of this line of teaching is
 
05:40:21.670 --> 05:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
actually denying

pro-life women care

especially difficult obstetrical care

from a physician that she can trust
 
05:40:33.510 --> 05:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
because they share the same values

a 2019 national survey of
 
05:40:40.230 --> 05:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
more than 1700 faith-based professionals

were pressured

were pressured
forced

forced
 
05:40:49.030 --> 05:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
or actually punished
 
05:40:51.510 --> 05:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
to participate in training or performing
 
05:40:52.868 --> 05:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
a procedure
 
05:40:55.830 --> 05:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
that they found objectionable based on
 
05:40:58.628 --> 05:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
their own ethical principles
 
05:41:00.628 --> 05:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
over 70 percent of these respondents
 
05:41:01.910 --> 05:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
said they would rather leave the
 
05:41:01.920 --> 05:41:03.670 align:start position:0%
said they would rather leave the
profession

05:41:03.670 --> 05:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
profession
 
05:41:05.830 --> 05:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
than be forced to violate their
 
05:41:05.840 --> 05:41:07.830 align:start position:0%
than be forced to violate their
conscience

05:41:07.830 --> 05:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
05:41:10.628 --> 05:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
so you see conscience
 
05:41:13.510 --> 05:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
our conscience is developed by moral
 
05:41:13.520 --> 05:41:15.190 align:start position:0%
our conscience is developed by moral
reasoning

05:41:15.190 --> 05:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
reasoning
 
05:41:17.590 --> 05:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
therefore it's more than just a private
 
05:41:20.948 --> 05:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
moral sensibility it is rational
 
05:41:23.350 --> 05:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
and its claims and conclusions can be
 
05:41:23.360 --> 05:41:24.470 align:start position:0%
and its claims and conclusions can be
communicated

05:41:24.470 --> 05:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
communicated
 
05:41:26.390 --> 05:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
and taught to others
 
05:41:28.230 --> 05:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
when healthcare professionals believe
 
05:41:30.150 --> 05:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
that they themselves are morally
 
05:41:32.310 --> 05:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for their own
 
05:41:34.628 --> 05:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
decisions their own intentions and their
 
05:41:35.830 --> 05:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
own actions
 
05:41:39.190 --> 05:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
they must maintain their moral integrity
 
05:41:41.830 --> 05:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
they should never be treated as mere
 
05:41:45.750 --> 05:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
channels for the preferences of others
 
05:41:48.788 --> 05:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
individual integrity is not simply one
 
05:41:51.430 --> 05:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
interest among many it's a fundamental
 
05:41:51.440 --> 05:41:52.470 align:start position:0%
interest among many it's a fundamental
value

05:41:52.470 --> 05:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
value
 
05:41:55.030 --> 05:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
that warrants the highest highest level
 
05:41:58.868 --> 05:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
of moral consideration and respect
 
05:42:00.948 --> 05:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
no professional organization or
 
05:42:03.110 --> 05:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
governing body should ever mandate
 
05:42:05.750 --> 05:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
participation in medical practices or
 
05:42:08.150 --> 05:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
procedures that violate the conscience
 
05:42:10.310 --> 05:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
of a health care professional
 
05:42:11.830 --> 05:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
or trainee
 
05:42:13.990 --> 05:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
the right or i should say in protecting
 
05:42:16.070 --> 05:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
the right of conscience the state
 
05:42:18.310 --> 05:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
is in no way inserting itself into the
 
05:42:20.390 --> 05:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
doctor-patient relationship
 
05:42:22.788 --> 05:42:22.798 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman and dr johnson

thank you for taking my question in
 
05:43:12.548 --> 05:43:12.558 align:start position:0%
regards to the survey when we're clear
 
05:43:13.910 --> 05:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
about the database in which the survey
 
05:43:16.548 --> 05:43:16.558 align:start position:0%
was taken not for or against it but be
 
05:43:18.948 --> 05:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
clear for all of us that was taken from
 
05:43:21.190 --> 05:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
faith-based health professionals correct
 
05:43:22.948 --> 05:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
in your opinion is that a somewhat
 
05:43:22.958 --> 05:43:23.990 align:start position:0%
in your opinion is that a somewhat
skewed

05:43:23.990 --> 05:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
skewed
 
05:43:25.590 --> 05:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
biased survey
 
05:43:27.910 --> 05:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
the survey was focused on
 
05:43:29.750 --> 05:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
faith-based health professionals because
 
05:43:31.910 --> 05:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
it wanted to find out what faith-based
 
05:43:33.750 --> 05:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
health professionals thought
 
05:43:35.830 --> 05:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
not what the general
 
05:43:37.590 --> 05:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
population of health care professionals
 
05:43:40.150 --> 05:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
thinks so yes it was a targeted audience
 
05:43:45.110 --> 05:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:46.948 --> 05:43:46.958 align:start position:0%

and they have some information to
 
05:44:09.590 --> 05:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
provide us relative to the
 
05:44:12.230 --> 05:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
bill on the table
 
05:44:14.070 --> 05:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:44:15.910 --> 05:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative mcmahon members of the
 
05:44:15.920 --> 05:44:16.868 align:start position:0%
representative mcmahon members of the
committee

05:44:16.868 --> 05:44:16.878 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:44:19.430 --> 05:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
um we're here today just to talk about
 
05:44:23.110 --> 05:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
one technical aspect of the bill
 
05:44:25.510 --> 05:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
currently the bill would create a new
 
05:44:28.310 --> 05:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
chapter 126 ee
 
05:44:30.150 --> 05:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
and sorry about that
 
05:44:31.830 --> 05:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
as we can see
 
05:44:31.840 --> 05:44:32.708 align:start position:0%
as we can see
on

05:44:32.708 --> 05:44:32.718 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:44:34.230 --> 05:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
page 2
 
05:44:37.510 --> 05:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
romans 6 line 11 beginning at line 11
 
05:44:39.590 --> 05:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
there are numerous health care providers
 
05:44:41.750 --> 05:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
implicated by this bill
 
05:44:44.868 --> 05:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
and because dhhs lacks oversight over
 
05:44:46.708 --> 05:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
these providers we would suggest that
 
05:44:49.030 --> 05:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps a more fitting place to
 
05:44:50.868 --> 05:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
put this would be
 
05:44:52.708 --> 05:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
under the office of professional
 
05:44:55.270 --> 05:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
licensure and specifically
 
05:45:00.070 --> 05:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:02.070 --> 05:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
that is all that we
 
05:45:03.590 --> 05:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
have to provide at the moment and we're
 
05:45:06.470 --> 05:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions
 
05:45:08.230 --> 05:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for being succinct
 
05:45:10.070 --> 05:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
and clear
 
05:45:12.390 --> 05:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative merchant
 
05:45:13.910 --> 05:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the recommendation
 
05:45:16.628 --> 05:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
about where to place the rsa
 
05:45:19.670 --> 05:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen rsa 332 but sometimes we
 
05:45:22.628 --> 05:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
get into oplc we get into specific
 
05:45:24.230 --> 05:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
professions versus getting something
 
05:45:24.240 --> 05:45:25.670 align:start position:0%
professions versus getting something
broadly

05:45:25.670 --> 05:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
broadly
 
05:45:28.390 --> 05:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
is that rsa broad or is that something
 
05:45:31.030 --> 05:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
specific to physicians surgeons and so
 
05:45:31.040 --> 05:45:32.708 align:start position:0%
specific to physicians surgeons and so
forth

05:45:32.708 --> 05:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
forth
 
05:45:34.230 --> 05:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh we
 
05:45:35.590 --> 05:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
suggested that because that would create
 
05:45:38.868 --> 05:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
a new chapter uh in the in that in 332 m
 
05:45:40.230 --> 05:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
would be a new chapter so that would
 
05:45:42.948 --> 05:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
specifically fit with this legislation
 
05:45:44.470 --> 05:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
and that's because we felt that that
 
05:45:45.670 --> 05:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
would be the broadest way to do it
 
05:45:47.350 --> 05:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
because it encumbrances provider as a
 
05:45:51.430 --> 05:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
lot of different definitions in the bill
 
05:45:53.430 --> 05:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:45:55.510 --> 05:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:45:57.990 --> 05:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
i'll recognize uh next
 
05:46:02.548 --> 05:46:02.558 align:start position:0%
ms kayla montgomery and ms liz canada
 
05:46:06.548 --> 05:46:06.558 align:start position:0%
representing planned parenthood
 
05:46:09.350 --> 05:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
and they oppose the bill
 
05:46:10.948 --> 05:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
and they're asking we trying to keep
 
05:46:12.548 --> 05:46:12.558 align:start position:0%
this as uh close to two and a half
 
05:46:15.270 --> 05:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
minutes if you will sure thing
 
05:46:17.190 --> 05:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
and then we thank you very much
 
05:46:21.830 --> 05:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:24.310 --> 05:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
good afternoon honorable members of this
 
05:46:26.548 --> 05:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
committee my name is liz canada i'm the
 
05:46:28.310 --> 05:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
advocacy manager of planned parenthood
 
05:46:29.590 --> 05:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
of northern new england and planned
 
05:46:31.990 --> 05:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
parenthood new hampshire action fund we
 
05:46:34.230 --> 05:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
we oppose house bill 1080.
 
05:46:36.310 --> 05:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
because this bill is so sweeping it
 
05:46:38.150 --> 05:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
allows almost anyone who works at a
 
05:46:39.750 --> 05:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
health care facility to refuse to
 
05:46:41.670 --> 05:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
participate in sexual and reproductive
 
05:46:44.150 --> 05:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
health care services including abortion
 
05:46:46.230 --> 05:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
sterilization or the distribution of
 
05:46:46.240 --> 05:46:47.670 align:start position:0%
sterilization or the distribution of
contraception

05:46:47.670 --> 05:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
contraception
 
05:46:49.670 --> 05:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
therefore house bill 1080 imposes a
 
05:46:51.990 --> 05:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
significant hardship on women
 
05:46:54.070 --> 05:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
particularly patients in rural areas of
 
05:46:55.590 --> 05:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:46:57.590 --> 05:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
everyone has the right to trust that
 
05:46:59.270 --> 05:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
health care workers will provide the
 
05:47:00.948 --> 05:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
best care possible
 
05:47:03.750 --> 05:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
not worry that they may instead impose
 
05:47:05.590 --> 05:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
their private religious beliefs on their
 
05:47:05.600 --> 05:47:06.868 align:start position:0%
their private religious beliefs on their
patients

05:47:06.868 --> 05:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
patients
 
05:47:08.628 --> 05:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood opposes
 
05:47:10.948 --> 05:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
discrimination in all forms
 
05:47:12.628 --> 05:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
however religious freedom does not
 
05:47:15.030 --> 05:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
include the right to harm others
 
05:47:17.110 --> 05:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
the boundaries for moral or ethical
 
05:47:19.110 --> 05:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
objections are not defined in the bill
 
05:47:21.430 --> 05:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
resulting in limitless possibilities for
 
05:47:23.270 --> 05:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
providers who refuse to give essential
 
05:47:26.310 --> 05:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
care including timely prescriptions
 
05:47:28.628 --> 05:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
the bill allows any service to be denied
 
05:47:30.390 --> 05:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
by anyone who is employed at a health
 
05:47:32.708 --> 05:47:32.718 align:start position:0%
care entity including administrative
 
05:47:34.868 --> 05:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
staff schedulers pharmacists aides
 
05:47:37.190 --> 05:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
social workers just to name a few
 
05:47:38.470 --> 05:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
for example
 
05:47:39.910 --> 05:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
a woman with an appointment to see a
 
05:47:42.230 --> 05:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
provider about birth control may not
 
05:47:44.150 --> 05:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
even be able to see her doctor if the
 
05:47:46.470 --> 05:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
receptionist refuses to process her
 
05:47:49.110 --> 05:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
paperwork based on a moral objection
 
05:47:51.670 --> 05:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps because she's unmarried
 
05:47:54.868 --> 05:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
a cashier can refuse to sell condoms
 
05:47:56.548 --> 05:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
a pharmacist can refuse to fill a
 
05:47:58.470 --> 05:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
woman's prescription for birth control
 
05:48:00.070 --> 05:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether it is prescribed
 
05:48:01.830 --> 05:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
for contraception or for other medical
 
05:48:01.840 --> 05:48:03.670 align:start position:0%
for contraception or for other medical
reasons

05:48:03.670 --> 05:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
05:48:05.990 --> 05:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
especially for those in small towns or
 
05:48:08.070 --> 05:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
rural areas in new hampshire this bill
 
05:48:08.080 --> 05:48:08.868 align:start position:0%
rural areas in new hampshire this bill
could

05:48:08.868 --> 05:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:48:10.230 --> 05:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
mean that they cannot get the timely
 
05:48:11.910 --> 05:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
care that they need this could cause
 
05:48:13.750 --> 05:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
long-term irreversible harm to those
 
05:48:15.190 --> 05:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
seeking care
 
05:48:16.390 --> 05:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
there's a there's an important
 
05:48:17.830 --> 05:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
distinction between religious
 
05:48:19.510 --> 05:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
accommodations that do not harm third
 
05:48:21.270 --> 05:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
parties and those that do harm third
 
05:48:23.350 --> 05:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
parties in the case of this bill we are
 
05:48:25.030 --> 05:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
not talking about an accommodation that
 
05:48:26.868 --> 05:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
will merely allow a provider to meet his
 
05:48:28.470 --> 05:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
or her religious needs
 
05:48:31.190 --> 05:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
an accommodation for example might be to
 
05:48:33.030 --> 05:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
make exceptions to a wardrobe policy
 
05:48:34.948 --> 05:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're talking about
 
05:48:36.948 --> 05:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
in this case the bill directly imposes
 
05:48:38.868 --> 05:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
hardship on a single group of people to
 
05:48:40.390 --> 05:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
allow for providers to make moral
 
05:48:41.990 --> 05:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
judgments about the health care needs of
 
05:48:42.000 --> 05:48:43.110 align:start position:0%
judgments about the health care needs of
women

05:48:43.110 --> 05:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
women
 
05:48:44.868 --> 05:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
under this bill there's no obligation
 
05:48:46.868 --> 05:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
for a refusing provider to find someone
 
05:48:49.030 --> 05:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
to deliver care to a woman even in a
 
05:48:50.788 --> 05:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
life-threatening emergency worth seconds
 
05:48:53.110 --> 05:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
count this bill does not include any
 
05:48:55.270 --> 05:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
protections for patients even if
 
05:48:57.030 --> 05:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
someone's life or health is at risk or
 
05:48:59.670 --> 05:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
someone is the victim of sexual assault
 
05:49:01.350 --> 05:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
this body is not unfamiliar with this
 
05:49:03.830 --> 05:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
bill it was voted down 2018 in a two to
 
05:49:03.840 --> 05:49:05.670 align:start position:0%
bill it was voted down 2018 in a two to
one

05:49:05.670 --> 05:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:49:05.680 --> 05:49:07.110 align:start position:0%

margin

05:49:07.110 --> 05:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
margin
 
05:49:09.750 --> 05:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
and so just want to close with one thing
 
05:49:12.788 --> 05:49:12.798 align:start position:0%
if the legislature enables providers to
 
05:49:14.548 --> 05:49:14.558 align:start position:0%
refuse to participate in the delivery of
 
05:49:15.830 --> 05:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
reproductive health care like
 
05:49:17.670 --> 05:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
contraception and abortion based on
 
05:49:19.270 --> 05:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
their personal beliefs then what other
 
05:49:20.788 --> 05:49:20.798 align:start position:0%
essential health care will providers
 
05:49:22.868 --> 05:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
refuse to deliver we urge you to vote in
 
05:49:24.548 --> 05:49:24.558 align:start position:0%
expedience legislate
 
05:49:25.990 --> 05:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you montgomery did you
 
05:49:29.270 --> 05:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:31.590 --> 05:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your cooperation
 
05:49:33.350 --> 05:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
i recognize
 
05:49:37.830 --> 05:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:40.470 --> 05:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much if we enact this
 
05:49:42.708 --> 05:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
statute protecting the rights of
 
05:49:44.868 --> 05:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
conscience on
 
05:49:47.510 --> 05:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
of of those who object to the provision
 
05:49:49.270 --> 05:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
of these services
 
05:49:52.470 --> 05:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
should we not repeal the burdens on the
 
05:49:55.830 --> 05:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
rights of conscience of those who choose
 
05:49:58.390 --> 05:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
would choose absent our most recent
 
05:49:58.400 --> 05:49:59.590 align:start position:0%
would choose absent our most recent
statute

05:49:59.590 --> 05:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:50:02.390 --> 05:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
to provide reproductive care
 
05:50:04.948 --> 05:50:04.958 align:start position:0%
to those who need it but they are
 
05:50:06.948 --> 05:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
forbidden to do so by our current
 
05:50:06.958 --> 05:50:15.590 align:start position:0%
forbidden to do so by our current
statutes

05:50:15.590 --> 05:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:17.350 --> 05:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not fully understanding that
 
05:50:19.990 --> 05:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
question but i think that if this uh if
 
05:50:21.990 --> 05:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
this was enacted we would have to look
 
05:50:22.000 --> 05:50:22.628 align:start position:0%
this was enacted we would have to look
at

05:50:22.628 --> 05:50:22.638 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:50:24.230 --> 05:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of statues because this has
 
05:50:26.150 --> 05:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
very broad implications on what it would
 
05:50:26.160 --> 05:50:27.350 align:start position:0%
very broad implications on what it would
do

05:50:27.350 --> 05:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:50:28.868 --> 05:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
could i could i just clarify the
 
05:50:30.788 --> 05:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
question a follow-up representative
 
05:50:33.350 --> 05:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
weather should we not afford equal
 
05:50:36.150 --> 05:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
rights of conscience
 
05:50:39.510 --> 05:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
not only to those who object to these
 
05:50:42.868 --> 05:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
procedures but also to those who believe
 
05:50:45.510 --> 05:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
as a matter of conscience
 
05:50:47.670 --> 05:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
that the services
 
05:50:50.070 --> 05:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
should be provided and should be
 
05:50:52.470 --> 05:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
provided without the limitations in the
 
05:50:55.110 --> 05:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
current statutes yes
 
05:50:57.110 --> 05:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a balancing and part
 
05:50:58.948 --> 05:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
of the issue with this bill is there is
 
05:51:01.030 --> 05:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
no balancing here for patients there's
 
05:51:03.910 --> 05:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
no protections for patients
 
05:51:05.830 --> 05:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
and there's not even any referrals in
 
05:51:09.670 --> 05:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
this so if someone came in and they
 
05:51:11.110 --> 05:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
the provider that they were seeing
 
05:51:12.470 --> 05:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
didn't believe in birth control they
 
05:51:13.750 --> 05:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the patient wouldn't be able to
 
05:51:15.590 --> 05:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
be referred to some place that did
 
05:51:17.830 --> 05:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
provide birth control so there's no
 
05:51:19.110 --> 05:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
there's no patient protections here in
 
05:51:24.070 --> 05:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:26.788 --> 05:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
representative merchant thank you mr
 
05:51:29.190 --> 05:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
05:51:29.200 --> 05:51:30.470 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

05:51:30.470 --> 05:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:51:32.150 --> 05:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
i think we're referring to the broad
 
05:51:33.990 --> 05:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
scope what is considered a health care
 
05:51:34.000 --> 05:51:35.670 align:start position:0%
scope what is considered a health care
provider

05:51:35.670 --> 05:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
provider
 
05:51:39.350 --> 05:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's on page 2 lines 11-16
 
05:51:40.948 --> 05:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
and the way it is written is very very
 
05:51:43.590 --> 05:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
broad to your point
 
05:51:45.510 --> 05:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
i do also wanted to follow up with sense
 
05:51:47.350 --> 05:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
with representative weber
 
05:51:48.868 --> 05:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
is trying to balance things but until we
 
05:51:50.230 --> 05:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
get to the point of trying to balance
 
05:51:50.240 --> 05:51:51.270 align:start position:0%
get to the point of trying to balance
things

05:51:51.270 --> 05:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:51:52.830 --> 05:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with this bill here before
 
05:51:55.670 --> 05:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
us so
 
05:51:58.390 --> 05:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
would you be looking to try to narrow
 
05:52:00.230 --> 05:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
that scope of who's considered a health
 
05:52:01.750 --> 05:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
care provider to really the person
 
05:52:03.430 --> 05:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
providing that direct service to the
 
05:52:05.350 --> 05:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
patient versus all the other people
 
05:52:08.310 --> 05:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
within the facility
 
05:52:09.750 --> 05:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that we're in the
 
05:52:11.670 --> 05:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
business of sort of rewriting this bill
 
05:52:13.830 --> 05:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
when i look at what's in front of us
 
05:52:16.230 --> 05:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
we know that this has broad implications
 
05:52:17.990 --> 05:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
and that
 
05:52:19.910 --> 05:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
we don't think that this bill as is will
 
05:52:21.910 --> 05:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
work in new hampshire if you all feel
 
05:52:23.510 --> 05:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
that this bill you know if there could
 
05:52:26.070 --> 05:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
be rewrites but when we look at what's
 
05:52:26.080 --> 05:52:27.190 align:start position:0%
be rewrites but when we look at what's
written

05:52:27.190 --> 05:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
written
 
05:52:29.030 --> 05:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
the implications are
 
05:52:31.270 --> 05:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
drastic and they have broad implications
 
05:52:34.070 --> 05:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
on patients being able to receive
 
05:52:39.750 --> 05:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
quality care and frankly care that is
 
05:52:43.670 --> 05:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:45.270 --> 05:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any further
 
05:52:45.280 --> 05:52:47.350 align:start position:0%

05:53:30.390 --> 05:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
organization with uh with thousands of
 
05:53:31.670 --> 05:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
members and i'm here on behalf of them
 
05:53:35.430 --> 05:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of hb 1080.
 
05:53:38.070 --> 05:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
many of you have heard about
 
05:53:39.510 --> 05:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:53:42.150 --> 05:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
the the uyghur problem in in china like
 
05:53:44.310 --> 05:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
for instance being forced to eat pork
 
05:53:46.548 --> 05:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
against their muslim religion and i
 
05:53:49.510 --> 05:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
would argue today that uh that without a
 
05:53:49.520 --> 05:53:50.628 align:start position:0%
would argue today that uh that without a
healthcare

05:53:50.628 --> 05:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
healthcare
 
05:53:52.868 --> 05:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
provider right of conscience it's very
 
05:53:54.708 --> 05:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
very similar
 
05:53:57.190 --> 05:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:54:01.350 --> 05:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
so hb 1080 basically allows us to uphold
 
05:54:01.360 --> 05:54:02.868 align:start position:0%
so hb 1080 basically allows us to uphold
the

05:54:02.868 --> 05:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:54:04.310 --> 05:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
rights of conscience which are enshrined
 
05:54:06.150 --> 05:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
in our constitution for healthcare
 
05:54:06.160 --> 05:54:07.190 align:start position:0%
in our constitution for healthcare
professionals

05:54:07.190 --> 05:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
05:54:09.110 --> 05:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
according to a research letter published
 
05:54:11.270 --> 05:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
in the journal of the american uh
 
05:54:15.030 --> 05:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
medical association in 2019 46 states
 
05:54:17.190 --> 05:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
have laws explicitly protecting the
 
05:54:19.430 --> 05:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
right of health care providers to refuse
 
05:54:21.190 --> 05:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
to participate in abortion
 
05:54:22.788 --> 05:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
of those
 
05:54:24.310 --> 05:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
of those four remaining one state
 
05:54:26.230 --> 05:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
exempts any procedure contrary to
 
05:54:27.830 --> 05:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
somebody's conscience so that leaves
 
05:54:29.910 --> 05:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
only three states us vermont and
 
05:54:29.920 --> 05:54:31.190 align:start position:0%
only three states us vermont and
colorado

05:54:31.190 --> 05:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
colorado
 
05:54:32.868 --> 05:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
and so the question becomes well do we
 
05:54:34.310 --> 05:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
actually need a law to protect this is
 
05:54:35.590 --> 05:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
this a problem
 
05:54:35.600 --> 05:54:36.548 align:start position:0%
this a problem
well

05:54:36.548 --> 05:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:54:37.990 --> 05:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
federal law you know some people say
 
05:54:39.030 --> 05:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
federal law protects the rights of
 
05:54:40.470 --> 05:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
conscience too
 
05:54:43.270 --> 05:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
so right next door in vermont in 2019
 
05:54:44.708 --> 05:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
the university of vermont medical center
 
05:54:46.390 --> 05:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
was issued a notice of violation by the
 
05:54:49.190 --> 05:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
federal hhs's office of civil rights
 
05:54:50.788 --> 05:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
which which was followed up by a civil
 
05:54:52.868 --> 05:54:52.878 align:start position:0%
suit with the department of justice
 
05:54:54.310 --> 05:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
which i was originally going to read
 
05:54:55.750 --> 05:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
verbatim but i'm going to summarize for
 
05:54:57.990 --> 05:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
the sake of time
 
05:55:00.708 --> 05:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
hhs reported that a nurse complained
 
05:55:00.718 --> 05:55:01.590 align:start position:0%
hhs reported that a nurse complained
was

05:55:01.590 --> 05:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:55:01.600 --> 05:55:03.030 align:start position:0%
was
so

05:55:03.030 --> 05:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:55:05.830 --> 05:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
uvmc forced the nurse to assist in an
 
05:55:08.230 --> 05:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
abortion against her religious or moral
 
05:55:09.990 --> 05:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
objections the nurse had expressed an
 
05:55:11.830 --> 05:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
objection for many years and was
 
05:55:14.230 --> 05:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
included in a list of objectors but they
 
05:55:15.990 --> 05:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
knowingly assigned her to an abortion
 
05:55:16.000 --> 05:55:17.510 align:start position:0%
knowingly assigned her to an abortion
procedure

05:55:17.510 --> 05:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
05:55:20.310 --> 05:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
um when the doc when the doctor
 
05:55:23.030 --> 05:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
knowing about the nurse's uh religious
 
05:55:23.040 --> 05:55:24.868 align:start position:0%
knowing about the nurse's uh religious
beliefs

05:55:24.868 --> 05:55:24.878 align:start position:0%
beliefs
 
05:55:27.110 --> 05:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
had her had her in the room he said
 
05:55:28.948 --> 05:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
don't hate me
 
05:55:30.628 --> 05:55:30.638 align:start position:0%
the nurse again objected another staff
 
05:55:31.990 --> 05:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
were present who could have taken it
 
05:55:34.150 --> 05:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
taking it on but she was required to
 
05:55:34.160 --> 05:55:35.510 align:start position:0%
taking it on but she was required to
assist

05:55:35.510 --> 05:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
assist
 
05:55:37.350 --> 05:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
she reasonably failed fear that they
 
05:55:39.030 --> 05:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
would fire her or report her to the
 
05:55:41.270 --> 05:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
licensing authorities if she didn't help
 
05:55:42.708 --> 05:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
another article reports that the nurse
 
05:55:45.270 --> 05:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
has been traumatized ever since
 
05:55:47.830 --> 05:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
and also that she she left that hospital
 
05:55:47.840 --> 05:55:49.270 align:start position:0%
and also that she she left that hospital
eventually

05:55:49.270 --> 05:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
05:55:51.110 --> 05:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
the investigation also uncovered that
 
05:55:53.430 --> 05:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
many uh several other people
 
05:55:56.230 --> 05:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
who had similar concerns and that their
 
05:55:58.470 --> 05:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
act their staffing policy actually
 
05:56:00.390 --> 05:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh materially violated the church
 
05:56:00.400 --> 05:56:01.670 align:start position:0%
uh materially violated the church
amendments

05:56:01.670 --> 05:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
05:56:03.430 --> 05:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
so if i can just throw in one little
 
05:56:05.270 --> 05:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
thing of that story i had a lot more but
 
05:56:06.628 --> 05:56:06.638 align:start position:0%
that's all i want to throw in
 
05:56:06.638 --> 05:56:08.310 align:start position:0%
that's all i want to throw in
um

05:56:08.310 --> 05:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:10.788 --> 05:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
so the the reason that the federal law
 
05:56:12.548 --> 05:56:12.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't protect us here in new
 
05:56:14.230 --> 05:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire after the turnover in
 
05:56:15.990 --> 05:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
administration administrations in august
 
05:56:18.948 --> 05:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
of 2021 it was reported that hhs and doj
 
05:56:21.030 --> 05:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
drop those suits
 
05:56:23.510 --> 05:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
so there's no longer
 
05:56:25.430 --> 05:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
any enforcement going on and this is
 
05:56:26.708 --> 05:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
what happens when you don't have state
 
05:56:28.548 --> 05:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
level protections
 
05:56:29.910 --> 05:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
okay let's hold right there because we
 
05:56:31.830 --> 05:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
have questions for you representative
 
05:56:34.788 --> 05:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
shapiro thank you mr chairman i'm still
 
05:56:37.910 --> 05:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
struggling with the comparison to um
 
05:56:40.628 --> 05:56:40.638 align:start position:0%
uyghurs being forced to eat pork
 
05:56:42.948 --> 05:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that they're not offered to
 
05:56:44.310 --> 05:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
go to another restaurant where they
 
05:56:46.548 --> 05:56:46.558 align:start position:0%
don't have to eat pork but wouldn't
 
05:56:48.548 --> 05:56:48.558 align:start position:0%
health care providers be able to take a
 
05:56:51.590 --> 05:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
job someplace else that was
 
05:56:55.110 --> 05:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
better suited to their ethical concerns
 
05:56:57.030 --> 05:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
well so so thank you for the question
 
05:56:59.110 --> 05:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
representative so so what one comment
 
05:57:00.548 --> 05:57:00.558 align:start position:0%
i'll make is that
 
05:57:00.558 --> 05:57:01.350 align:start position:0%
i'll make is that
uh

05:57:01.350 --> 05:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:57:03.110 --> 05:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
for instance dartmouth is the largest
 
05:57:03.120 --> 05:57:03.990 align:start position:0%
for instance dartmouth is the largest
health

05:57:03.990 --> 05:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
health
 
05:57:06.548 --> 05:57:06.558 align:start position:0%
provider in new hampshire and if you're
 
05:57:07.750 --> 05:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
in certain parts of the states you can't
 
05:57:10.070 --> 05:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
go anywhere else
 
05:57:12.788 --> 05:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
and if you take a look at their
 
05:57:15.510 --> 05:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
their residency obgyn they say
 
05:57:17.190 --> 05:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
write on their faq on their website
 
05:57:19.030 --> 05:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
quote residents who do not provide
 
05:57:20.868 --> 05:57:20.878 align:start position:0%
abortions themselves are still expected
 
05:57:22.470 --> 05:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
to counsel patients make appropriate
 
05:57:24.548 --> 05:57:24.558 align:start position:0%
referrals and manage post-abortile
 
05:57:26.548 --> 05:57:26.558 align:start position:0%
complications so if you're a resident it
 
05:57:29.190 --> 05:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
is very difficult to switch programs
 
05:57:30.548 --> 05:57:30.558 align:start position:0%
if you're a physician in a rural place
 
05:57:32.230 --> 05:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's very you may not be able to go
 
05:57:35.430 --> 05:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:37.270 --> 05:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:57:39.590 --> 05:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
for mr hennessey
 
05:57:41.110 --> 05:57:41.120 align:start position:0%

nurse who worked in maternal child
 
05:58:39.910 --> 05:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
health for in an acute care hospital for
 
05:58:41.750 --> 05:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
about 30 years
 
05:58:43.350 --> 05:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
my family is one of many health

my family is one of many health
professionals

05:58:46.390 --> 05:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:48.470 --> 05:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
nurses a doctor pa
 
05:58:51.270 --> 05:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
and other health care professionals
 
05:58:52.708 --> 05:58:52.718 align:start position:0%
many of them work in the health care
 
05:58:54.868 --> 05:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
system in new hampshire
 
05:58:57.910 --> 05:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
i was shocked and dismayed to read that
 
05:58:59.990 --> 05:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is only one of three
 
05:59:00.000 --> 05:59:01.430 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is only one of three
states

05:59:01.430 --> 05:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:59:04.390 --> 05:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
without right of conscience protection
 
05:59:07.990 --> 05:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
how can that be
 
05:59:09.830 --> 05:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
never thankfully in my nursing career
 
05:59:11.750 --> 05:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
was i ever put in a position where i
 
05:59:13.510 --> 05:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
would be forced
 
05:59:15.190 --> 05:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
into doing something that went against
 
05:59:16.868 --> 05:59:16.878 align:start position:0%
my conscience
 
05:59:19.590 --> 05:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
a conscience formed by my amazing
 
05:59:21.110 --> 05:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
catholic faith
 
05:59:23.670 --> 05:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
which has always and unequivocally
 
05:59:26.548 --> 05:59:26.558 align:start position:0%
taught about and upheld
 
05:59:30.390 --> 05:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
the dignity and sacredness of human life
 
05:59:32.868 --> 05:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
never would i have imagined that i or
 
05:59:34.310 --> 05:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
one of my children
 
05:59:37.110 --> 05:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
would possibly be coerced into becoming
 
05:59:38.548 --> 05:59:38.558 align:start position:0%
an accomplice
 
05:59:42.150 --> 05:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
in the direct killing of an unborn child
 
05:59:45.750 --> 05:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
this would be unconscionable
 
05:59:48.628 --> 05:59:48.638 align:start position:0%
we are endowed by our creator
 
05:59:51.430 --> 05:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
freedom of conscience would fall under
 
05:59:54.470 --> 05:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the pursuit of happiness and life
 
05:59:55.990 --> 05:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
i said that wrong in the wrong order
 
05:59:56.000 --> 05:59:57.190 align:start position:0%
i said that wrong in the wrong order
sorry

05:59:57.190 --> 05:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:59:59.430 --> 05:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
how do we achieve happiness by choosing
 
06:00:01.750 --> 06:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
to do what is good
 
06:00:04.548 --> 06:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
and avoiding evil
 
06:00:06.708 --> 06:00:06.718 align:start position:0%
simple truths
 
06:00:08.868 --> 06:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
to force anyone to go against what they
 
06:00:11.670 --> 06:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
know to be objectively true
 
06:00:13.670 --> 06:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
and just that is
 
06:00:17.110 --> 06:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
that all human life is sacred
 
06:00:19.350 --> 06:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
and then to deny our very freedom of
 
06:00:19.360 --> 06:00:20.470 align:start position:0%
and then to deny our very freedom of
conscience

06:00:20.470 --> 06:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
06:00:25.030 --> 06:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:27.270 --> 06:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
this freedom is what our country was
 
06:00:29.110 --> 06:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
founded upon
 
06:00:31.190 --> 06:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
we are in a world that has largely
 
06:00:34.470 --> 06:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
abandoned god and instead increasingly
 
06:00:37.510 --> 06:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
relies upon the whims of man
 
06:00:39.590 --> 06:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
these are dark times
 
06:00:42.070 --> 06:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
of great evil much of it disguised as
 
06:00:42.080 --> 06:00:43.350 align:start position:0%
of great evil much of it disguised as
good

06:00:43.350 --> 06:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
good
 
06:00:45.190 --> 06:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
i ask that we together make new
 
06:00:47.670 --> 06:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire stronger
 
06:00:50.310 --> 06:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
by helping to return
 
06:00:52.150 --> 06:00:52.160 align:start position:0%

i am in full support of house bill 1080
 
06:01:53.350 --> 06:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
protecting the medical professionals
 
06:01:55.670 --> 06:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
against prosecution for acting according
 
06:01:57.750 --> 06:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
to their ethical religious and moral

convictions
 
06:02:02.070 --> 06:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
the term patient advocate is a highly
 
06:02:04.868 --> 06:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
respected and valuable role within the
 
06:02:06.708 --> 06:02:06.718 align:start position:0%

in the best interest of their patients
 
06:02:17.270 --> 06:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
i don't believe there is one health care
 
06:02:19.990 --> 06:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
professional who hasn't
 
06:02:22.470 --> 06:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
section 4 under this bill precisely and
 
06:02:24.948 --> 06:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
accurately describes adverse actions
 
06:02:24.958 --> 06:02:25.990 align:start position:0%
accurately describes adverse actions
suffered

06:02:25.990 --> 06:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
suffered
 
06:02:29.110 --> 06:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
when a provider goes against the tide
 
06:02:31.430 --> 06:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
these are real and happen for lesser
 
06:02:31.440 --> 06:02:32.948 align:start position:0%
these are real and happen for lesser
actions

06:02:32.948 --> 06:02:32.958 align:start position:0%
actions
 
06:02:35.430 --> 06:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
healthcare professionals are good people
 
06:02:36.948 --> 06:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
a safety net
 
06:02:38.548 --> 06:02:38.558 align:start position:0%
in the system
 
06:02:41.830 --> 06:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:43.910 --> 06:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
many will leave or be fired if
 
06:02:43.920 --> 06:02:45.750 align:start position:0%
many will leave or be fired if
unprotected

06:02:45.750 --> 06:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
unprotected
 
06:02:48.390 --> 06:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
let's consider for a moment euthanasia
 
06:02:50.470 --> 06:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
in place of abortion
 
06:02:52.470 --> 06:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
would it be acceptable to order health
 
06:02:55.510 --> 06:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
care professionals to participate
 
06:02:57.750 --> 06:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
or provide this to patients
 
06:02:59.270 --> 06:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
why not
 
06:03:01.270 --> 06:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
the care of the disabled is commonly
 
06:03:06.230 --> 06:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:08.390 --> 06:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
does this sound familiar
 
06:03:10.788 --> 06:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
in regards to abortion
 
06:03:12.868 --> 06:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
we need medical professionals who value
 
06:03:15.270 --> 06:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable of our society
 
06:03:18.070 --> 06:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
the baby in the womb the disabled the
 
06:03:18.080 --> 06:03:19.350 align:start position:0%
the baby in the womb the disabled the
elderly

06:03:19.350 --> 06:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
elderly
 
06:03:22.470 --> 06:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
i urge you to consider this tidal wave
 
06:03:25.910 --> 06:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
described often as the culture of death
 
06:03:27.670 --> 06:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
and please protect those who may be
 
06:03:30.070 --> 06:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
caring for you and me
 
06:03:31.430 --> 06:03:31.440 align:start position:0%

bill

06:04:13.670 --> 06:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:04:15.750 --> 06:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
in my tradition and in my faith
 
06:04:17.990 --> 06:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
religious freedom is always and
 
06:04:20.310 --> 06:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily coupled with moral
 
06:04:22.788 --> 06:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility indeed this is what we
 
06:04:24.868 --> 06:04:24.878 align:start position:0%
mean when we say that every one of us is
 
06:04:27.350 --> 06:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
created in the image of god
 
06:04:29.990 --> 06:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
we are given life and breath to freely
 
06:04:32.548 --> 06:04:32.558 align:start position:0%
love god and to freely love one another
 
06:04:35.030 --> 06:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
and this very freedom endows us with the
 
06:04:37.670 --> 06:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
energy and spirit needed to sustain
 
06:04:40.310 --> 06:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
communities of compassion institutions
 
06:04:42.788 --> 06:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
committed to wellness and relationships
 
06:04:44.548 --> 06:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
that protect integrity
 
06:04:45.830 --> 06:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
and choice
 
06:04:48.470 --> 06:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
what religious freedom does not do not
 
06:04:50.390 --> 06:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
in any religion that i know
 
06:04:53.030 --> 06:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
is grant us license to deny much needed
 
06:04:55.430 --> 06:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
health care to those who need it or sow
 
06:04:58.548 --> 06:04:58.558 align:start position:0%
the seeds of distrust and contempt or to
 
06:05:00.708 --> 06:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
stigmatize the legitimate choices of
 
06:05:03.190 --> 06:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
women seeking to do what's best for
 
06:05:05.510 --> 06:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
their own bodies and i'm concerned that
 
06:05:08.470 --> 06:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
this is precisely what hb 1080 and
 
06:05:11.270 --> 06:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
legislation like it is doing
 
06:05:13.750 --> 06:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire we are responsible
 
06:05:15.910 --> 06:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
all of us together for building
 
06:05:18.310 --> 06:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
institutions that promote the health and
 
06:05:21.030 --> 06:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
honor the integrity of all our neighbors
 
06:05:24.150 --> 06:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
all our friends all our sisters and all
 
06:05:26.110 --> 06:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
our brothers that's our human
 
06:05:29.510 --> 06:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility our moral and spiritual
 
06:05:31.750 --> 06:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility and to shirk that
 
06:05:34.868 --> 06:05:34.878 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to compromise our
 
06:05:37.830 --> 06:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
religious freedom hb 1080 would deny
 
06:05:40.548 --> 06:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
patients in our state particularly in
 
06:05:43.190 --> 06:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
rural or underserved areas essential
 
06:05:45.750 --> 06:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
health care and timely prescriptions in
 
06:05:48.390 --> 06:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
the world this bill creates a refusing
 
06:05:50.788 --> 06:05:50.798 align:start position:0%
provider is under no obligation to find
 
06:05:53.350 --> 06:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
someone else to deliver quality care to
 
06:05:55.990 --> 06:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
a woman in need leaving that same woman
 
06:05:57.990 --> 06:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
especially in a life-threatening
 
06:05:59.910 --> 06:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
emergency without any access to
 
06:06:02.390 --> 06:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
critically needed medical care this kind
 
06:06:04.788 --> 06:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
of world not only perverts the notion of
 
06:06:07.510 --> 06:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
religious freedom it endangers the real
 
06:06:10.548 --> 06:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
lives the sacred lives of our sisters
 
06:06:13.110 --> 06:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
mothers grandmothers and friends it's
 
06:06:14.708 --> 06:06:14.718 align:start position:0%
not a world i would want for my
 
06:06:17.430 --> 06:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
parishioners in durham or for my wife or
 
06:06:19.190 --> 06:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
for my three daughters or whatever
 
06:06:21.270 --> 06:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
grandchildren are coming our way
 
06:06:23.510 --> 06:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
in my tradition which is indeed the
 
06:06:25.350 --> 06:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
biblical tradition of judaism and
 
06:06:28.150 --> 06:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
christianity freedom is gifted to human
 
06:06:30.868 --> 06:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
beings and human communities so that we
 
06:06:33.750 --> 06:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
might freely and joyfully care for one
 
06:06:35.990 --> 06:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
another and create networks of
 
06:06:38.548 --> 06:06:38.558 align:start position:0%
protection and healing and even
 
06:06:41.750 --> 06:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
celebration when we use that same notion
 
06:06:44.628 --> 06:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
of freedom to marginalize the poor among
 
06:06:47.030 --> 06:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
us or to stigmatize women seeking the
 
06:06:49.910 --> 06:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
best for themselves or their families we
 
06:06:52.948 --> 06:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
have wandered off the map of justice and
 
06:06:59.030 --> 06:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:02.548 --> 06:07:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:04.230 --> 06:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much sir for
 
06:07:07.430 --> 06:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:11.910 --> 06:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:15.990 --> 06:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:18.628 --> 06:07:18.638 align:start position:0%
representing the aclu of new hampshire
 
06:07:20.150 --> 06:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
they oppose the bill and you have
 
06:07:21.990 --> 06:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
written testimony which you'll pass out
 
06:07:24.628 --> 06:07:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:24.638 --> 06:07:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:07:25.670 --> 06:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:07:27.910 --> 06:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
you have two minutes
 
06:07:35.110 --> 06:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:44.230 --> 06:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:46.390 --> 06:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
06:07:47.510 --> 06:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you so much for the
 
06:07:49.830 --> 06:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify today uh my name
 
06:07:51.590 --> 06:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
is frank knack i'm the policy director
 
06:07:54.548 --> 06:07:54.558 align:start position:0%
with the aclu of new hampshire
 
06:07:56.390 --> 06:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
you all have my testimony now so i will
 
06:07:59.110 --> 06:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
not read it much of what we uh we have
 
06:08:00.788 --> 06:08:00.798 align:start position:0%
in the content there has already been
 
06:08:02.868 --> 06:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
discussed i think i'll just focus on one
 
06:08:04.788 --> 06:08:04.798 align:start position:0%
aspect that i think was raised by a
 
06:08:06.548 --> 06:08:06.558 align:start position:0%
legislator earlier which is the need to
 
06:08:06.558 --> 06:08:07.750 align:start position:0%
legislator earlier which is the need to
balance

06:08:07.750 --> 06:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
balance
 
06:08:09.590 --> 06:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we we have a proper
 
06:08:11.110 --> 06:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
balance in new hampshire right now we
 
06:08:13.030 --> 06:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
both i think as was mentioned we have
 
06:08:15.590 --> 06:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
federal law that ensures that people can
 
06:08:17.750 --> 06:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
exercise their religious freedom
 
06:08:19.830 --> 06:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
unless it causes an undue burden on
 
06:08:22.070 --> 06:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
their employer we also in the new
 
06:08:23.750 --> 06:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire law against discrimination
 
06:08:26.310 --> 06:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
have a similar protection in existing
 
06:08:28.788 --> 06:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
law and i'd also like to point you to
 
06:08:31.590 --> 06:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
footnotes two through five in in my
 
06:08:31.600 --> 06:08:32.868 align:start position:0%
footnotes two through five in in my
testimony

06:08:32.868 --> 06:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:08:35.430 --> 06:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
which has the explicit language of the
 
06:08:37.750 --> 06:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
various um professional health
 
06:08:39.270 --> 06:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
organizations the american medical
 
06:08:40.788 --> 06:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
association american college of
 
06:08:43.510 --> 06:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
physicians american nurses association
 
06:08:46.390 --> 06:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
the american academy of physician
 
06:08:46.400 --> 06:08:47.670 align:start position:0%
the american academy of physician
associates

06:08:47.670 --> 06:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
associates
 
06:08:49.190 --> 06:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
and i think it's important to look how
 
06:08:51.750 --> 06:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
they wrote their their ethical standards
 
06:08:53.750 --> 06:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
versus what this bill would do and i
 
06:08:55.510 --> 06:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
think the main difference is that there
 
06:08:57.990 --> 06:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
is no exception in this bill
 
06:08:59.830 --> 06:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
there is zero opportunity so if a
 
06:09:02.310 --> 06:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
patient comes in i think as was alluded
 
06:09:04.310 --> 06:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
to earlier
 
06:09:05.830 --> 06:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
where they have to have an abortion to
 
06:09:08.310 --> 06:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
save the the patient's life and they're
 
06:09:09.990 --> 06:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
in a small rural place where they can't
 
06:09:11.990 --> 06:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
find someone else that doctor could
 
06:09:14.070 --> 06:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
refuse or a nurse or someone else on the
 
06:09:16.708 --> 06:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
medical staff could refuse the care
 
06:09:18.628 --> 06:09:18.638 align:start position:0%
um and there is nothing under this law
 
06:09:20.230 --> 06:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
that that profession would actually be
 
06:09:22.548 --> 06:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
protected under this law and so i think
 
06:09:24.310 --> 06:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
the blanket uh
 
06:09:26.310 --> 06:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
zero exception language in this bill is
 
06:09:28.868 --> 06:09:28.878 align:start position:0%
extremely concerning and so i would hope
 
06:09:30.788 --> 06:09:30.798 align:start position:0%
that this legislature
 
06:09:32.070 --> 06:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
you know legislators here in this
 
06:09:32.080 --> 06:09:33.110 align:start position:0%
you know legislators here in this
committee

06:09:33.110 --> 06:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:09:35.430 --> 06:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
will oppose this bill it is dangerous
 
06:09:37.350 --> 06:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
and it is in fact the healthcare denial
 
06:09:39.590 --> 06:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
act so thank you
 
06:09:41.430 --> 06:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr kanek is there any
 
06:09:44.390 --> 06:09:44.400 align:start position:0%

no well none none being seen thank you
 
06:09:50.070 --> 06:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:56.628 --> 06:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:58.788 --> 06:09:58.798 align:start position:0%

very difficult circumstances
 
06:10:27.430 --> 06:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
i'm i understand the
 
06:10:28.868 --> 06:10:28.878 align:start position:0%
other new hampshire medical society
 
06:10:31.030 --> 06:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
individual couldn't come testify so i'm
 
06:10:33.750 --> 06:10:33.760 align:start position:0%

which i come
 
06:10:45.110 --> 06:10:45.120 align:start position:0%

i'm in opposition to the bill
it

06:10:46.390 --> 06:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:10:49.510 --> 06:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately targets a major segment of
 
06:10:52.948 --> 06:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
our population reproductive aged women
 
06:10:54.868 --> 06:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
in a way that would limit their health
 
06:10:57.110 --> 06:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
care opportunities to plan their
 
06:10:57.120 --> 06:10:58.310 align:start position:0%
care opportunities to plan their
pregnancies

06:10:58.310 --> 06:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
pregnancies
 
06:11:00.070 --> 06:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
to space them
 
06:11:02.788 --> 06:11:02.798 align:start position:0%
to avoid the medical risks associated
 
06:11:05.110 --> 06:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
with pregnancy
 
06:11:05.120 --> 06:11:06.070 align:start position:0%
with pregnancy
and

06:11:06.070 --> 06:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:11:08.470 --> 06:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's especially true of which is a broad
 
06:11:10.310 --> 06:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
bill which involves pharmacists and
 
06:11:12.470 --> 06:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
providers where you end up in a
 
06:11:15.510 --> 06:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
situation where you could actually have
 
06:11:17.270 --> 06:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
difficulty getting medicine for
 
06:11:20.390 --> 06:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
reproductive infertility treatments
 
06:11:23.510 --> 06:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
rei procedures and health care for
 
06:11:25.510 --> 06:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
contraception which is
 
06:11:27.190 --> 06:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
women's health care and it's the one
 
06:11:29.670 --> 06:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
thing we know that prevents abortion is
 
06:11:31.670 --> 06:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
really excellent contraceptive care
 
06:11:33.670 --> 06:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing that does it i
 
06:11:36.470 --> 06:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
would like
 
06:11:38.708 --> 06:11:38.718 align:start position:0%
if i may since the question got up about
 
06:11:38.718 --> 06:11:39.830 align:start position:0%
if i may since the question got up about
training

06:11:39.830 --> 06:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
training
 
06:11:42.470 --> 06:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
at our program as many programs in the
 
06:11:42.480 --> 06:11:43.510 align:start position:0%
at our program as many programs in the
country

06:11:43.510 --> 06:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
country
 
06:11:46.150 --> 06:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
no one is expected
 
06:11:48.230 --> 06:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
to participate in a termination of
 
06:11:50.948 --> 06:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
pregnancy period
 
06:11:53.350 --> 06:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
not expected it doesn't happen they do
 
06:11:55.190 --> 06:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
need to know how to manage complications
 
06:11:57.430 --> 06:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
and i will submit this is an example for
 
06:12:00.070 --> 06:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
problems for our state
 
06:12:02.230 --> 06:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
of someone has a termination of
 
06:12:04.070 --> 06:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
pregnancy they come to their rural
 
06:12:04.080 --> 06:12:05.110 align:start position:0%
pregnancy they come to their rural
hospital

06:12:05.110 --> 06:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
06:12:06.788 --> 06:12:06.798 align:start position:0%
and they're septic
 
06:12:08.470 --> 06:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
they have an infection
 
06:12:10.070 --> 06:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
and they're going to die if they don't
 
06:12:11.750 --> 06:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
get treatment and we have somebody says
 
06:12:14.628 --> 06:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
i don't participate in termination and
 
06:12:16.470 --> 06:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
helping you because you did it is
 
06:12:18.230 --> 06:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
something i won't do
 
06:12:18.240 --> 06:12:19.190 align:start position:0%
something i won't do
so

06:12:19.190 --> 06:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:12:21.030 --> 06:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
let's hope that doesn't happen but
 
06:12:23.750 --> 06:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's a consequence that one could see
 
06:12:26.310 --> 06:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
will you take some a question of course
 
06:12:28.070 --> 06:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative merchant thank
 
06:12:29.990 --> 06:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
you mr chair and thank you dr baker for
 
06:12:31.430 --> 06:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:12:34.788 --> 06:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the page 2 under line 16.
 
06:12:37.590 --> 06:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
i want to be clear

that
 
06:13:12.150 --> 06:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
in in addition to our trainees not being
 
06:13:14.628 --> 06:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
expected to do abortions
 
06:13:16.868 --> 06:13:16.878 align:start position:0%
it's already the circumstance
 
06:13:16.878 --> 06:13:17.830 align:start position:0%
it's already the circumstance
where

06:13:17.830 --> 06:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:13:19.190 --> 06:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
no one in the
 
06:13:20.150 --> 06:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
in the
 
06:13:22.070 --> 06:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
places where abortions are done have any
 
06:13:23.910 --> 06:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
expectation in providing we're very
 
06:13:26.230 --> 06:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
careful the places that do it i say we
 
06:13:28.310 --> 06:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
just because it's the big state because
 
06:13:28.320 --> 06:13:29.110 align:start position:0%
just because it's the big state because
we're

06:13:29.110 --> 06:13:29.120 align:start position:0%

06:13:36.390 --> 06:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
especially in this climate
 
06:13:37.830 --> 06:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
no one
 
06:13:39.350 --> 06:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
would want to put anybody in that
 
06:13:40.708 --> 06:13:40.718 align:start position:0%
circumstance where they felt like they
 
06:13:42.868 --> 06:13:42.878 align:start position:0%
had to participate in something that was
 
06:13:44.868 --> 06:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
against their place for abortion in
 
06:13:46.390 --> 06:13:46.400 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair and thank you very
 
06:13:53.110 --> 06:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question i should
 
06:13:56.070 --> 06:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
have asked this earlier
 
06:13:57.990 --> 06:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
what does it mean to you
 
06:14:03.510 --> 06:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:08.310 --> 06:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:10.150 --> 06:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
i mean they could be
 
06:14:12.150 --> 06:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
06:14:15.190 --> 06:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
methods of contraception that
 
06:14:17.350 --> 06:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
imply that the pregnancy can't implant
 
06:14:19.350 --> 06:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
or it's an abortifacient
 
06:14:19.360 --> 06:14:20.628 align:start position:0%
or it's an abortifacient
that's

06:14:20.628 --> 06:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:14:23.110 --> 06:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
potentially what the intent is
 
06:14:23.120 --> 06:14:23.990 align:start position:0%
potentially what the intent is
okay

06:14:23.990 --> 06:14:24.000 align:start position:0%

i have a relatively simple
bill

06:24:20.788 --> 06:24:20.798 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:24:22.868 --> 06:24:22.878 align:start position:0%
when you have bad law
 
06:24:25.030 --> 06:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
you need to get rid of it
 
06:24:26.230 --> 06:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
and this
 
06:24:29.430 --> 06:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
this particular law
 
06:24:31.030 --> 06:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
is bad
 
06:24:34.628 --> 06:24:34.638 align:start position:0%
it was passed a few years ago really
 
06:24:36.070 --> 06:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
with some
 
06:24:39.590 --> 06:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
some lies about what it does
 
06:24:42.628 --> 06:24:42.638 align:start position:0%
and what what kind of
 
06:24:47.430 --> 06:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:48.628 --> 06:24:48.638 align:start position:0%
it is
 
06:24:51.350 --> 06:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
it talks about you can't talk you can't
 
06:24:53.750 --> 06:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
talk to children about
 
06:24:53.760 --> 06:24:54.788 align:start position:0%
talk to children about
sex

06:24:54.788 --> 06:24:54.798 align:start position:0%
sex
 
06:24:56.948 --> 06:24:56.958 align:start position:0%
is what it really boils down to
 
06:24:59.350 --> 06:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
and you can't go to your pastor and say
 
06:25:00.948 --> 06:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
can we do it
 
06:25:03.190 --> 06:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
now i've got a a friend
 
06:25:05.990 --> 06:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
who is a is a pastor and i said how do
 
06:25:07.990 --> 06:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
you get around this bill
 
06:25:11.270 --> 06:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
well i can't except
 
06:25:13.910 --> 06:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
we can have religious discussions
 
06:25:15.510 --> 06:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
so it can be
 
06:25:17.670 --> 06:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
circumvented but that's not the reason
 
06:25:19.670 --> 06:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
we need to get rid of it
 
06:25:19.680 --> 06:25:20.390 align:start position:0%
we need to get rid of it
so

06:25:20.390 --> 06:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:25:22.150 --> 06:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
i'm a simple person i've got i'm an
 
06:25:27.030 --> 06:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
engineer i'm a pilot i i i i don't wax
 
06:25:27.040 --> 06:25:28.310 align:start position:0%
engineer i'm a pilot i i i i don't wax
eloquently

06:25:28.310 --> 06:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
eloquently
 
06:25:31.510 --> 06:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
like the the chairman did up here
 
06:25:31.520 --> 06:25:32.868 align:start position:0%
like the the chairman did up here
uh

06:25:32.868 --> 06:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:25:32.878 --> 06:25:34.230 align:start position:0%
uh
so

06:25:34.230 --> 06:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:25:36.390 --> 06:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
this is one that i think we
 
06:25:37.910 --> 06:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
we have to pass
 
06:25:37.920 --> 06:25:39.110 align:start position:0%
we have to pass

06:26:20.868 --> 06:26:20.878 align:start position:0%
a matter of
 
06:26:23.350 --> 06:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
parents dropping off their 14 year old
 
06:26:25.270 --> 06:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
and the therapist throws the kid in the
 
06:26:27.350 --> 06:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
closet and locks the door and yells and
 
06:26:27.360 --> 06:26:29.590 align:start position:0%
closet and locks the door and yells and
screams

06:26:29.590 --> 06:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
screams
 
06:26:32.868 --> 06:26:32.878 align:start position:0%
if that's what it is i would oppose it
 
06:26:32.878 --> 06:26:33.750 align:start position:0%
if that's what it is i would oppose it
but

06:26:33.750 --> 06:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:26:35.510 --> 06:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen
 
06:26:37.990 --> 06:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm you know i'm disappointed that
 
06:26:39.670 --> 06:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
there were certain members
 
06:26:42.150 --> 06:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
of the house who
 
06:26:45.030 --> 06:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
raised those kinds of issues
 
06:26:46.230 --> 06:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
06:26:49.510 --> 06:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative presenting the bill
 
06:26:52.230 --> 06:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
06:26:56.070 --> 06:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
what procedures are used for conversion
 
06:26:56.080 --> 06:27:00.628 align:start position:0%
what procedures are used for conversion
therapy

06:27:00.628 --> 06:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:05.110 --> 06:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:07.430 --> 06:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of
 
06:27:09.430 --> 06:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
therapists would talk to them
 
06:27:11.750 --> 06:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know about their fears
 
06:27:13.590 --> 06:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know what they think
 
06:27:15.430 --> 06:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
06:27:17.590 --> 06:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be taking a cattle prod to
 
06:27:18.948 --> 06:27:18.958 align:start position:0%
them it wouldn't be locking them in a
 
06:27:18.958 --> 06:27:20.708 align:start position:0%
them it wouldn't be locking them in a
closet

06:27:20.708 --> 06:27:20.718 align:start position:0%
closet
 
06:27:22.628 --> 06:27:22.638 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be any of those kinds of
 
06:27:24.788 --> 06:27:24.798 align:start position:0%
things that a lot of people
 
06:27:28.230 --> 06:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
have tried to have a scare tactic
 
06:27:31.830 --> 06:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:33.270 --> 06:27:33.280 align:start position:0%

i am the

06:28:54.150 --> 06:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
nami new hampshire is a non-profit

through support education and advocacy
 
06:29:06.868 --> 06:29:06.878 align:start position:0%
on behalf of nami new hampshire i'm here
 
06:29:09.430 --> 06:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
today to speak in opposition to house
 
06:29:12.468 --> 06:29:12.478 align:start position:0%
bill 1077 repealing the prohibition on
 
06:29:15.110 --> 06:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy for minors
 
06:29:17.670 --> 06:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things that we're
 
06:29:20.390 --> 06:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
taught is that providers should do no
 
06:29:23.190 --> 06:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
harm in their treatment of patients
 
06:29:25.190 --> 06:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
and conversion therapy does have the
 
06:29:27.350 --> 06:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
potential to do harm
 
06:29:30.230 --> 06:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
and it can cause shame and trauma which
 
06:29:34.310 --> 06:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
can have lifelong effects
 
06:29:37.270 --> 06:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
it also does have the potential of being
 
06:29:37.280 --> 06:29:39.910 align:start position:0%
it also does have the potential of being
life-threatening

06:29:39.910 --> 06:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
life-threatening
 
06:29:42.310 --> 06:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
suicide is the second leading cause of
 
06:29:44.948 --> 06:29:44.958 align:start position:0%
death for individuals who are age 10 to
 
06:29:47.830 --> 06:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
24 years in the state of new hampshire
 
06:29:51.430 --> 06:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
it's also as well as nationwide as well
 
06:29:51.440 --> 06:29:53.110 align:start position:0%
it's also as well as nationwide as well
lgbtq

06:29:53.110 --> 06:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
lgbtq
 
06:29:55.590 --> 06:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
youth represent a significant high risk
 
06:29:58.468 --> 06:29:58.478 align:start position:0%
there's a subgroup within that cohort
 
06:30:00.390 --> 06:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
and they're at a significantly higher
 
06:30:03.190 --> 06:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
risk with a rate of suicide attempts
 
06:30:05.990 --> 06:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
that is four times greater
 
06:30:09.190 --> 06:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:12.468 --> 06:30:12.478 align:start position:0%
for the lgbtq group and for
 
06:30:14.468 --> 06:30:14.478 align:start position:0%
youth that are questioning
 
06:30:17.190 --> 06:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
it's two times greater um than their
 
06:30:20.310 --> 06:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:23.830 --> 06:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
also the suicide attempts by this uh
 
06:30:26.868 --> 06:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
particular subgroup of youth the lgbtq
 
06:30:26.878 --> 06:30:27.750 align:start position:0%
particular subgroup of youth the lgbtq
group

06:30:27.750 --> 06:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
group
 
06:30:30.948 --> 06:30:30.958 align:start position:0%
um are four to six times more likely to
 
06:30:33.110 --> 06:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
result in injury
 
06:30:33.120 --> 06:30:34.948 align:start position:0%
result in injury
poisoning

06:30:34.948 --> 06:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
poisoning
 
06:30:37.990 --> 06:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
or an overdose that results in medical
 
06:30:38.000 --> 06:30:39.510 align:start position:0%
or an overdose that results in medical
treatment

06:30:39.510 --> 06:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
06:30:41.430 --> 06:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
and again that's four to six
 
06:30:41.440 --> 06:30:42.548 align:start position:0%
and again that's four to six
times

06:30:42.548 --> 06:30:42.558 align:start position:0%
times
 
06:30:46.230 --> 06:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
more likely than their straight peers
 
06:30:47.990 --> 06:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
and more related i know we're here to
 
06:30:49.990 --> 06:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
talk about conversion therapy
 
06:30:52.390 --> 06:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
not just suicide rates
 
06:30:55.110 --> 06:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
but specifically related to this bill
 
06:30:57.190 --> 06:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
and the potential for harm of conversion
 
06:30:57.200 --> 06:30:59.310 align:start position:0%
and the potential for harm of conversion
therapy

06:30:59.310 --> 06:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
06:31:02.948 --> 06:31:02.958 align:start position:0%
lgbt youth who come from
 
06:31:05.670 --> 06:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
highly rejecting families
 
06:31:08.948 --> 06:31:08.958 align:start position:0%
are 8.4 times more likely to have
 
06:31:10.948 --> 06:31:10.958 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide
 
06:31:10.958 --> 06:31:11.750 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide
than

06:31:11.750 --> 06:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
than
 
06:31:16.788 --> 06:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
lgbt peers who reported either no levels
 
06:31:21.270 --> 06:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
or low levels of family rejection
 
06:31:23.110 --> 06:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
the practice of conversion therapy in
 
06:31:24.468 --> 06:31:24.478 align:start position:0%
any form
 
06:31:26.310 --> 06:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
is a danger to the mental health and
 
06:31:26.320 --> 06:31:27.590 align:start position:0%
is a danger to the mental health and
well-being

06:31:27.590 --> 06:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
06:31:29.910 --> 06:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
of youth and young adults so nami new
 
06:31:32.310 --> 06:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire urges that the committee votes
 
06:31:34.788 --> 06:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on house bill
 
06:31:34.798 --> 06:31:36.468 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on house bill
1077

06:31:36.468 --> 06:31:36.478 align:start position:0%
1077
 
06:31:37.910 --> 06:31:37.920 align:start position:0%

06:31:42.230 --> 06:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
soloway
 
06:31:43.910 --> 06:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:31:46.230 --> 06:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
welcome back director stevens i i like
 
06:31:48.548 --> 06:31:48.558 align:start position:0%
your new title
 
06:31:51.590 --> 06:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
can you parse for us
 
06:31:55.670 --> 06:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:00.468 --> 06:32:00.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:02.788 --> 06:32:02.798 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding
 
06:32:02.798 --> 06:32:03.670 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding
that

06:32:03.670 --> 06:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:32:05.990 --> 06:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy
 
06:32:08.948 --> 06:32:08.958 align:start position:0%
would be done
 
06:32:10.788 --> 06:32:10.798 align:start position:0%
when the youth
 
06:32:13.110 --> 06:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
is not interested
 
06:32:16.230 --> 06:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
in exploring
 
06:32:18.230 --> 06:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
where they're at
 
06:32:21.590 --> 06:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:24.310 --> 06:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
regular counseling if if a youth was
 
06:32:26.070 --> 06:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
questioning which is one of the groups
 
06:32:27.510 --> 06:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
that i talked about
 
06:32:29.430 --> 06:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
and they go and explore that with a
 
06:32:31.590 --> 06:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
therapist that is not conversion therapy
 
06:32:34.708 --> 06:32:34.718 align:start position:0%
that is just therapy
 
06:32:38.548 --> 06:32:38.558 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy is when the youth
 
06:32:41.750 --> 06:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
goes in for treatment and
 
06:32:43.350 --> 06:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
their um
 
06:32:45.270 --> 06:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
i mean the whole program i mean the
 
06:32:49.190 --> 06:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
term conversion means to convert
 
06:32:51.190 --> 06:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
um so you're trying to convert somebody
 
06:32:54.070 --> 06:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
from one thing to another um
 
06:32:56.548 --> 06:32:56.558 align:start position:0%
mr chairman just a quick follow-up just
 
06:32:59.510 --> 06:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
a quick one uh uh director stevens just
 
06:33:01.750 --> 06:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
a quick question do you think it's
 
06:33:05.030 --> 06:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
possible in the context of legislation
 
06:33:08.788 --> 06:33:08.798 align:start position:0%
to actually parse the difference between
 
06:33:11.430 --> 06:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
counseling and conversion therapy so
 
06:33:14.628 --> 06:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:19.430 --> 06:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:21.110 --> 06:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know that's why you get paid the
 
06:33:24.868 --> 06:33:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:27.910 --> 06:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
who told representative leon
 
06:33:29.510 --> 06:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
06:33:31.910 --> 06:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
director stevens for taking the question
 
06:33:34.070 --> 06:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
i'm pulling at the same thread i'm not
 
06:33:36.310 --> 06:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
sure if you've heard the terms directive
 
06:33:39.270 --> 06:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
counseling and non-directive counseling
 
06:33:41.030 --> 06:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
the directive is when you're trying to
 
06:33:42.310 --> 06:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
achieve a certain goal and the
 
06:33:44.230 --> 06:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
non-directive is exploring along with
 
06:33:47.350 --> 06:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
the patient and i'm curious if
 
06:33:50.468 --> 06:33:50.478 align:start position:0%
having a ban on directive counseling in
 
06:33:51.990 --> 06:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
06:33:55.110 --> 06:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
gender would make and sexual identity
 
06:33:57.190 --> 06:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
would make more sense so that any of
 
06:33:57.200 --> 06:33:58.868 align:start position:0%
would make more sense so that any of
these

06:33:58.868 --> 06:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
these
 
06:34:00.868 --> 06:34:00.878 align:start position:0%
non-directive counseling sessions where
 
06:34:03.590 --> 06:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
they are working with the child and
 
06:34:05.830 --> 06:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
exploring with them would be clearly
 
06:34:08.390 --> 06:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
allowed in the law while prohibiting
 
06:34:10.788 --> 06:34:10.798 align:start position:0%
those where you're trying to direct them
 
06:34:13.430 --> 06:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
to any predetermined outcome i am
 
06:34:15.270 --> 06:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
sincerely hoping that there are some
 
06:34:17.430 --> 06:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
counselors behind me that might be able
 
06:34:19.190 --> 06:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
to answer that question for you because
 
06:34:21.270 --> 06:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
i don't have the expertise
 
06:34:22.788 --> 06:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
to answer that
 
06:34:27.510 --> 06:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:30.750 --> 06:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you and
 
06:34:30.760 --> 06:34:32.628 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you and
congratulations

06:34:32.628 --> 06:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
congratulations
 
06:34:37.110 --> 06:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
um the title of this is
 
06:34:39.030 --> 06:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy
 
06:34:41.430 --> 06:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that therapy is for
 
06:34:41.440 --> 06:34:43.030 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that therapy is for
illnesses

06:34:43.030 --> 06:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
illnesses
 
06:34:44.230 --> 06:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
and that
 
06:34:44.240 --> 06:34:45.110 align:start position:0%
and that
the

06:34:45.110 --> 06:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:34:46.948 --> 06:34:46.958 align:start position:0%
illness of
 
06:34:49.750 --> 06:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
gay lesbian bisexual
 
06:34:51.830 --> 06:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
implies that that's an illness but do
 
06:34:55.830 --> 06:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:58.230 --> 06:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
that question
 
06:35:02.390 --> 06:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
i don't have an opinion on that i have
 
06:35:04.150 --> 06:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
been out of the mental health field for
 
06:35:06.310 --> 06:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
a number of years and i would have to
 
06:35:08.548 --> 06:35:08.558 align:start position:0%
my understanding and i think you
 
06:35:10.390 --> 06:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
probably know better than i would mr uh
 
06:35:12.070 --> 06:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative mckay is that that was
 
06:35:13.830 --> 06:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
removed from the dsm
 
06:35:16.630 --> 06:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
some number of years ago so
 
06:35:16.640 --> 06:35:17.830 align:start position:0%
some number of years ago so

group
 
06:35:32.868 --> 06:35:32.878 align:start position:0%
that is used by all professionals
 
06:35:35.830 --> 06:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
and there is no
 
06:35:38.310 --> 06:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
description in there of an illness for
 
06:35:40.150 --> 06:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
any of those
 
06:35:42.948 --> 06:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
categories and i i sometimes get them
 
06:35:45.990 --> 06:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
backwards but it's lgbt
 
06:35:46.000 --> 06:35:47.510 align:start position:0%
backwards but it's lgbt
transgender

06:35:47.510 --> 06:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
transgender
 
06:35:49.510 --> 06:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
questioning and all of those different
 
06:35:49.520 --> 06:35:50.628 align:start position:0%
questioning and all of those different
groups

06:35:50.628 --> 06:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
groups
 
06:35:52.788 --> 06:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
i don't consider any of those
 
06:35:54.708 --> 06:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
as illnesses
 
06:35:56.150 --> 06:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
but that
 
06:35:58.548 --> 06:35:58.558 align:start position:0%
my opinion is not particularly
 
06:36:02.548 --> 06:36:02.558 align:start position:0%
significant when the dsm is utilized by
 
06:36:04.868 --> 06:36:04.878 align:start position:0%
all professionals
 
06:36:04.878 --> 06:36:06.468 align:start position:0%
all professionals
and

06:36:06.468 --> 06:36:06.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:36:07.830 --> 06:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
so that i
 
06:36:09.670 --> 06:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
i think you agree
 
06:36:11.670 --> 06:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
that there is no description of an
 
06:36:15.430 --> 06:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
illness for any of those categories
 
06:36:16.628 --> 06:36:16.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you
 
06:36:18.628 --> 06:36:18.638 align:start position:0%
i made it a question
 
06:36:21.270 --> 06:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
i again i will i i will leave that to
 
06:36:23.350 --> 06:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
some other folks because i did was down
 
06:36:25.590 --> 06:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
in the uh another hearing where they
 
06:36:27.110 --> 06:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
06:36:29.510 --> 06:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria as being an actually
 
06:36:29.520 --> 06:36:31.030 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria as being an actually
recognized

06:36:31.030 --> 06:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
06:36:33.110 --> 06:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
medical condition so i don't want to
 
06:36:35.510 --> 06:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
opine on that given the fact that we did
 
06:36:38.548 --> 06:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
add transgender into that
 
06:36:40.830 --> 06:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
the chair has a question for you
 
06:36:45.430 --> 06:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
um we spoke about the suicide
 
06:36:47.510 --> 06:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
of those
 
06:36:49.750 --> 06:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
with us with a self-identity in a
 
06:36:53.190 --> 06:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:54.788 --> 06:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
i am aware
 
06:36:56.868 --> 06:36:56.878 align:start position:0%
in two cases
 
06:36:58.788 --> 06:36:58.798 align:start position:0%
of individuals
 
06:37:01.670 --> 06:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
but also in of literature
 
06:37:03.830 --> 06:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
of those who are very much questioning
 
06:37:05.990 --> 06:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
and certainly want to go in a direction
 
06:37:08.070 --> 06:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
and while they do not want to be forced
 
06:37:10.868 --> 06:37:10.878 align:start position:0%
in it they may want to be walked towards
 
06:37:10.878 --> 06:37:11.590 align:start position:0%
in it they may want to be walked towards
it

06:37:11.590 --> 06:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:37:14.708 --> 06:37:14.718 align:start position:0%
that is their goal in counseling and
 
06:37:16.788 --> 06:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
with gentle therapists
 
06:37:19.990 --> 06:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
and having been denied the availability
 
06:37:22.150 --> 06:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
of that because some counselors are
 
06:37:24.230 --> 06:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
scared to go into an area they think
 
06:37:26.788 --> 06:37:26.798 align:start position:0%
they can't go into anymore those people
 
06:37:28.468 --> 06:37:28.478 align:start position:0%
kill themselves
 
06:37:30.230 --> 06:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
so that suicide
 
06:37:31.670 --> 06:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
is not
 
06:37:31.680 --> 06:37:32.948 align:start position:0%
is not
just

06:37:32.948 --> 06:37:32.958 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:37:32.958 --> 06:37:33.990 align:start position:0%
just
um

06:37:33.990 --> 06:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:35.590 --> 06:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
l b
 
06:37:35.600 --> 06:37:36.948 align:start position:0%
l b
letters

06:37:36.948 --> 06:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
letters
 
06:37:42.070 --> 06:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
in hostile homes it is in people who
 
06:37:44.150 --> 06:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
really want something different than
 
06:37:45.990 --> 06:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
what they're experiencing and would like
 
06:37:47.910 --> 06:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
something lovingly to walk with them and
 
06:37:50.390 --> 06:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
absent that their suicide's there too
 
06:37:54.548 --> 06:37:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:56.390 --> 06:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know are you asking me
 
06:37:58.868 --> 06:37:58.878 align:start position:0%
specifically for numbers of questions oh
 
06:38:00.788 --> 06:38:00.798 align:start position:0%
just you do have an awareness of that
 
06:38:04.708 --> 06:38:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:06.948 --> 06:38:06.958 align:start position:0%
questioning youth are four to six more
 
06:38:09.990 --> 06:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
times likely to well that quite
 
06:38:12.390 --> 06:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
questioning youth and
 
06:38:15.350 --> 06:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
youth who are have identified
 
06:38:19.670 --> 06:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
as lgbtq have higher rates of suicide
 
06:38:21.510 --> 06:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
down the line i'm breaking out the
 
06:38:24.788 --> 06:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
questioning youth into two categories
 
06:38:27.590 --> 06:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
one of which is they're questioning that
 
06:38:28.948 --> 06:38:28.958 align:start position:0%
they don't like what they're
 
06:38:31.430 --> 06:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
experiencing and while they certainly
 
06:38:33.750 --> 06:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to be abused in counseling
 
06:38:35.830 --> 06:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
they want a counselor who understands
 
06:38:38.150 --> 06:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
and accepts them for where they are that
 
06:38:40.310 --> 06:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
is to say they don't really want to be
 
06:38:41.830 --> 06:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
what they're feeling at present and
 
06:38:43.670 --> 06:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
could somebody work them through what
 
06:38:45.990 --> 06:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
others have called a developmental stage
 
06:38:49.510 --> 06:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
and absent that friendly counselor there
 
06:38:51.670 --> 06:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
have been suicides
 
06:38:54.070 --> 06:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
would i be able to do some uh research
 
06:38:55.190 --> 06:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
and look into that for you
 
06:38:56.788 --> 06:38:56.798 align:start position:0%
representative pearson i don't know that
 
06:38:59.030 --> 06:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head okay neither do i
 
06:39:01.270 --> 06:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
i know of it and i would be most
 
06:39:03.350 --> 06:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
appreciative thank you representative
 
06:39:03.360 --> 06:39:04.788 align:start position:0%
appreciative thank you representative
shapiro

06:39:04.788 --> 06:39:04.798 align:start position:0%
shapiro
 
06:39:06.708 --> 06:39:06.718 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman
 
06:39:08.628 --> 06:39:08.638 align:start position:0%
would you believe that the statute
 
06:39:11.190 --> 06:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
that's in place which bans conversion
 
06:39:11.200 --> 06:39:13.750 align:start position:0%
that's in place which bans conversion
therapy

06:39:13.750 --> 06:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:15.590 --> 06:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
actually does quite a good job at
 
06:39:17.270 --> 06:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
parsing the difference between
 
06:39:17.280 --> 06:39:18.468 align:start position:0%
parsing the difference between
counseling

06:39:18.468 --> 06:39:18.478 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
06:39:19.990 --> 06:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
questioning youth
 
06:39:20.000 --> 06:39:21.030 align:start position:0%
questioning youth
and

06:39:21.030 --> 06:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:39:24.230 --> 06:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
banning conversion therapy
 
06:39:26.628 --> 06:39:26.638 align:start position:0%
the wording is that conversion therapy
 
06:39:29.430 --> 06:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
this says what conversion therapy is not
 
06:39:31.510 --> 06:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy shall not include
 
06:39:33.350 --> 06:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
counseling that provides
 
06:39:36.070 --> 06:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
acceptance support understanding and
 
06:39:38.788 --> 06:39:38.798 align:start position:0%
identity exploration and development
 
06:39:40.948 --> 06:39:40.958 align:start position:0%

words

06:39:42.468 --> 06:39:42.478 align:start position:0%
words
 
06:39:45.110 --> 06:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not considered um
 
06:39:47.590 --> 06:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy that is allowed that
 
06:39:50.708 --> 06:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
is what i think people are referring to
 
06:39:52.868 --> 06:39:52.878 align:start position:0%
so would you believe that this law as it
 
06:39:52.878 --> 06:39:53.990 align:start position:0%
so would you believe that this law as it
stands

06:39:53.990 --> 06:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
stands
 
06:39:56.468 --> 06:39:56.478 align:start position:0%
does quite a good job at allowing people
 
06:39:58.628 --> 06:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
to continue to work with people who are
 
06:40:00.070 --> 06:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
questioning their
 
06:40:02.948 --> 06:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
gender identity or sexual
 
06:40:02.958 --> 06:40:05.110 align:start position:0%
gender identity or sexual
orientation

06:40:05.110 --> 06:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
orientation
 
06:40:07.030 --> 06:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
as is
 
06:40:09.190 --> 06:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
from taken from somebody who's worked
 
06:40:12.948 --> 06:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
with adolescents most of my life
 
06:40:14.628 --> 06:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
most of who have questioned their
 
06:40:14.638 --> 06:40:18.150 align:start position:0%
most of who have questioned their
sexuality

06:40:18.150 --> 06:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:19.510 --> 06:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
i would believe
 
06:40:21.910 --> 06:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
that i'll just leave it at that
 
06:40:25.510 --> 06:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:27.270 --> 06:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
06:40:28.788 --> 06:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
06:40:28.798 --> 06:40:29.990 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

06:40:29.990 --> 06:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:40:35.110 --> 06:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:38.230 --> 06:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
great sympathy for people who
 
06:40:39.430 --> 06:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
have written
 
06:40:42.868 --> 06:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
and gone through and produced a bill
 
06:40:45.910 --> 06:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
that other people then were confused by
 
06:40:47.670 --> 06:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
and people thought
 
06:40:49.750 --> 06:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
that they were
 
06:40:49.760 --> 06:40:52.070 align:start position:0%
that they were
being

06:40:52.070 --> 06:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
being
 
06:40:54.468 --> 06:40:54.478 align:start position:0%
not allowed a service because of a
 
06:40:58.150 --> 06:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
confusion and thought in the bill
 
06:41:01.750 --> 06:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
and what i see happening is the same
 
06:41:01.760 --> 06:41:02.708 align:start position:0%
and what i see happening is the same
thing

06:41:02.708 --> 06:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
thing
 
06:41:05.750 --> 06:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the conversion
 
06:41:07.750 --> 06:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
therapy language
 
06:41:10.628 --> 06:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
there is enough ambiguity
 
06:41:13.270 --> 06:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
that many many counselors
 
06:41:15.510 --> 06:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
are concerned
 
06:41:18.310 --> 06:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
about the fact that they don't dare talk
 
06:41:20.708 --> 06:41:20.718 align:start position:0%
to them and i've gotten lots of emails
 
06:41:23.270 --> 06:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
from counselors specifically stating
 
06:41:25.990 --> 06:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
that that they stay away from this issue
 
06:41:29.030 --> 06:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
they don't counsel kids or young adults
 
06:41:30.230 --> 06:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
or adults
 
06:41:31.990 --> 06:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
even with this issue they just can't
 
06:41:34.390 --> 06:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
take them as patients because they don't
 
06:41:37.270 --> 06:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
know when they're breaking the law
 
06:41:39.190 --> 06:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:41:42.150 --> 06:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
if if you know if people vote not to
 
06:41:43.510 --> 06:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
repeal this
 
06:41:45.830 --> 06:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
i really hope somebody comes along and
 
06:41:48.150 --> 06:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
helps clarify
 
06:41:51.430 --> 06:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
this a whole lot better so that
 
06:41:54.070 --> 06:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
people the these counselors that are out
 
06:41:56.150 --> 06:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
there that could be doing this
 
06:41:56.160 --> 06:41:57.270 align:start position:0%
there that could be doing this
counseling

06:41:57.270 --> 06:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
06:42:00.150 --> 06:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
would then know where the boundaries are
 
06:42:02.390 --> 06:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
and be able to
 
06:42:02.400 --> 06:42:03.270 align:start position:0%
and be able to
um

06:42:03.270 --> 06:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:05.430 --> 06:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
add to the mental health
 
06:42:08.070 --> 06:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
professionals available to these people
 
06:42:10.788 --> 06:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
that are are questioning do you think
 
06:42:13.430 --> 06:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
that that is a way to possibly solve
 
06:42:16.708 --> 06:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:19.750 --> 06:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know um i wasn't prepared for a
 
06:42:22.150 --> 06:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
lot of the uh
 
06:42:23.990 --> 06:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
what what i
 
06:42:26.230 --> 06:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
i'm meaning notice respect seems like a
 
06:42:28.468 --> 06:42:28.478 align:start position:0%
little bit of a discussion
 
06:42:30.708 --> 06:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
around exec session type
 
06:42:33.190 --> 06:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
ideas so
 
06:42:35.270 --> 06:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
those i'm not prepared to respond to if
 
06:42:37.190 --> 06:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
06:42:39.190 --> 06:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:42:41.830 --> 06:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
i i don't you know i don't want you to
 
06:42:43.910 --> 06:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
ever feel pressured in your seat but we
 
06:42:46.548 --> 06:42:46.558 align:start position:0%
are here trying to draw as much
 
06:42:51.190 --> 06:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
information as we can out so that we can
 
06:42:53.670 --> 06:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
make good policy we're not
 
06:42:56.230 --> 06:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
in any way trying to give you a hard
 
06:42:56.240 --> 06:42:57.350 align:start position:0%
in any way trying to give you a hard
time

06:42:57.350 --> 06:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:42:59.110 --> 06:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
it's our way of saying
 
06:43:01.830 --> 06:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
give us more information i i think
 
06:43:03.990 --> 06:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
though the people that should give you
 
06:43:05.750 --> 06:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
that information
 
06:43:08.548 --> 06:43:08.558 align:start position:0%
are counselors who are struggling with
 
06:43:08.558 --> 06:43:10.070 align:start position:0%
are counselors who are struggling with
this

06:43:10.070 --> 06:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:43:12.628 --> 06:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's any behind me or
 
06:43:12.638 --> 06:43:13.670 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's any behind me or
not

06:43:13.670 --> 06:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:43:16.230 --> 06:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
but they might be able to guide you as
 
06:43:17.830 --> 06:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
to what language they would be
 
06:43:20.868 --> 06:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
comfortable with if it was in the law to
 
06:43:23.910 --> 06:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
do that type of counseling i can't speak
 
06:43:25.190 --> 06:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
for them
 
06:43:27.270 --> 06:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
having had a relatively unpleasant
 
06:43:30.310 --> 06:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
experience recently in that very seat
 
06:43:30.320 --> 06:43:31.670 align:start position:0%
experience recently in that very seat
um

06:43:31.670 --> 06:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:32.948 --> 06:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
you can
 
06:43:35.030 --> 06:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
go if you want to
 
06:43:38.150 --> 06:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
well one what after one person
 
06:43:41.670 --> 06:43:41.680 align:start position:0%

would you believe
 
06:43:47.310 --> 06:43:50.628 align:start position:0%
would you believe
[Laughter]

06:43:50.628 --> 06:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]

um
 
06:43:52.948 --> 06:43:52.958 align:start position:0%
would you believe that conversion
 
06:43:55.670 --> 06:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
therapy is more of a coercive therapy
 
06:43:59.110 --> 06:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
rather than traditional therapy
 
06:44:00.948 --> 06:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
i would believe that
 
06:44:03.350 --> 06:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:44:07.830 --> 06:44:07.840 align:start position:0%

well we're going to let her off the hook
 
06:44:09.840 --> 06:44:10.788 align:start position:0%
well we're going to let her off the hook
because

06:44:10.788 --> 06:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:44:13.590 --> 06:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
we have people she's deferring to others
 
06:44:13.600 --> 06:44:15.270 align:start position:0%
we have people she's deferring to others

06:46:03.190 --> 06:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
which tacitly promotes state intrusion
 
06:46:06.788 --> 06:46:06.798 align:start position:0%
and control in the psychotherapy process
 
06:46:09.350 --> 06:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
to me that violates the sanctity and
 
06:46:11.350 --> 06:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
fiduciary nature
 
06:46:13.350 --> 06:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
of psychotherapy
 
06:46:15.910 --> 06:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
any sort of enforcement would require
 
06:46:18.868 --> 06:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
state authority to insinuate itself into
 
06:46:20.708 --> 06:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
the therapy space
 
06:46:22.708 --> 06:46:22.718 align:start position:0%
and that's the sensitive area where
 
06:46:25.430 --> 06:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
clients are most vulnerable
 
06:46:27.510 --> 06:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
clients are encouraged to speak their
 
06:46:31.270 --> 06:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
minds without fear of censorship or
 
06:46:33.990 --> 06:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
coercion or retaliation
 
06:46:36.070 --> 06:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
they're prompted not to edit material
 
06:46:38.468 --> 06:46:38.478 align:start position:0%
but to simply report what comes to their
 
06:46:38.478 --> 06:46:39.670 align:start position:0%
but to simply report what comes to their
mind

06:46:39.670 --> 06:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
mind
 
06:46:41.830 --> 06:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
now that liberating
 
06:46:44.628 --> 06:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
practice is sharply constricted
 
06:46:47.270 --> 06:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
by title 332l
 
06:46:52.948 --> 06:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:56.788 --> 06:46:56.798 align:start position:0%
representative testerman described
 
06:47:00.468 --> 06:47:00.478 align:start position:0%
title 332l is a bad bill
 
06:47:03.670 --> 06:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to tell you why it is
 
06:47:05.830 --> 06:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
on the surface it appeared to be an
 
06:47:07.510 --> 06:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
effort in harm reduction but that's
 
06:47:09.590 --> 06:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
clearly not what it is it was not a
 
06:47:12.390 --> 06:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
response to any known or identified
 
06:47:12.400 --> 06:47:14.788 align:start position:0%
response to any known or identified
problem

06:47:14.788 --> 06:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
problem
 
06:47:16.948 --> 06:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
at the time of passage no one on the
 
06:47:19.030 --> 06:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
committee could identify a single
 
06:47:21.990 --> 06:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
therapist in new hampshire who was doing
 
06:47:24.310 --> 06:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy
 
06:47:26.468 --> 06:47:26.478 align:start position:0%
subsequently there has not been a single
 
06:47:28.868 --> 06:47:28.878 align:start position:0%
reported violation
 
06:47:31.030 --> 06:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
what was the call for it
 
06:47:33.030 --> 06:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
the driving force could not have been
 
06:47:35.750 --> 06:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
clinical i'll leave it to your surmise
 
06:47:39.510 --> 06:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
as to what the driving force was
 
06:47:39.520 --> 06:47:40.708 align:start position:0%
as to what the driving force was
also

06:47:40.708 --> 06:47:40.718 align:start position:0%
also
 
06:47:43.590 --> 06:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think that the job did that good
 
06:47:46.070 --> 06:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
that the bill did that good a job
 
06:47:48.708 --> 06:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
of uh parsing
 
06:47:48.718 --> 06:47:49.830 align:start position:0%
of uh parsing
um

06:47:49.830 --> 06:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:54.310 --> 06:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:56.468 --> 06:47:56.478 align:start position:0%
the premise of the conversion therapy
 
06:47:58.628 --> 06:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
law makes no sense at all
 
06:48:00.788 --> 06:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
and that is that the therapist decides
 
06:48:02.070 --> 06:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
the goals
 
06:48:05.590 --> 06:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
and seeks to change that's the word
 
06:48:08.468 --> 06:48:08.478 align:start position:0%
aspects of the individual but the
 
06:48:10.150 --> 06:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
therapist doesn't bring therapeutic
 
06:48:12.868 --> 06:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
goals into their therapy
 
06:48:15.750 --> 06:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
those come from the client
 
06:48:17.590 --> 06:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
to learn about the client's goals which
 
06:48:19.990 --> 06:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
are the only goals that count
 
06:48:23.350 --> 06:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
some inquiry is obviously involved
 
06:48:27.270 --> 06:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
but this law endangers that very process
 
06:48:30.390 --> 06:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
of inquiry which is now perilous for the
 
06:48:30.400 --> 06:48:31.670 align:start position:0%
of inquiry which is now perilous for the
therapist

06:48:31.670 --> 06:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
therapist
 
06:48:34.230 --> 06:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
simple questions may appear
 
06:48:34.240 --> 06:48:35.670 align:start position:0%
simple questions may appear
tendentious

06:48:35.670 --> 06:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
tendentious
 
06:48:37.750 --> 06:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
or an effort to change someone's
 
06:48:37.760 --> 06:48:40.868 align:start position:0%
or an effort to change someone's
sexuality

06:48:40.868 --> 06:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:43.750 --> 06:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
adolescents and youth are notoriously
 
06:48:43.760 --> 06:48:44.948 align:start position:0%
adolescents and youth are notoriously
uncertain

06:48:44.948 --> 06:48:44.958 align:start position:0%
uncertain
 
06:48:48.150 --> 06:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
about gender issues and these cannot be
 
06:48:50.468 --> 06:48:50.478 align:start position:0%
separated from other issues
 
06:48:52.468 --> 06:48:52.478 align:start position:0%
during an interview
 
06:48:56.070 --> 06:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
who decides if the line is crossed
 
06:48:58.708 --> 06:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
who will monitor or assess this
 
06:49:00.548 --> 06:49:00.558 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
06:49:00.558 --> 06:49:02.150 align:start position:0%
the statute
332l

06:49:02.150 --> 06:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
332l
 
06:49:04.788 --> 06:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
generously allows for what it calls
 
06:49:08.070 --> 06:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
quote sexual orientation neutral
 
06:49:08.080 --> 06:49:09.670 align:start position:0%
quote sexual orientation neutral
interventions

06:49:09.670 --> 06:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
interventions
 
06:49:12.868 --> 06:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
whatever that means who's to say
 
06:49:16.230 --> 06:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
injecting government agencies to monitor
 
06:49:17.430 --> 06:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
would not work
 
06:49:19.110 --> 06:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
the state should not be dictating
 
06:49:26.070 --> 06:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:28.548 --> 06:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
the law of unintended consequences
 
06:49:31.750 --> 06:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:34.628 --> 06:49:34.638 align:start position:0%
what has been the actual effect of title
 
06:49:38.070 --> 06:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
332 is ironic
 
06:49:41.510 --> 06:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
those whom it presumed to help
 
06:49:43.830 --> 06:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
have been harmed
 
06:49:46.628 --> 06:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
a new barrier was created
 
06:49:49.510 --> 06:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
which made therapy less available to
 
06:49:52.468 --> 06:49:52.478 align:start position:0%
adolescents and young adults
 
06:49:53.510 --> 06:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
the law
 
06:49:56.070 --> 06:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
has had a chilling effect
 
06:49:58.868 --> 06:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
and here are the real life consequences
 
06:50:03.190 --> 06:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
adolescents can't find treatment
 
06:50:06.070 --> 06:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
therapists steer clear of anything
 
06:50:08.948 --> 06:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
remotely touching on gender
 
06:50:11.270 --> 06:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
and no one will risk seeing this
 
06:50:11.280 --> 06:50:13.510 align:start position:0%
and no one will risk seeing this
population

06:50:13.510 --> 06:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
population
 
06:50:16.230 --> 06:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
thus many adolescents and young adults
 
06:50:18.628 --> 06:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
can find no help in new hampshire and
 
06:50:22.310 --> 06:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
may need referral out of state
 
06:50:25.350 --> 06:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
and that is not for gender issues that's
 
06:50:26.830 --> 06:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
for all
 
06:50:29.350 --> 06:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
issues i challenge anyone to find
 
06:50:31.670 --> 06:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
psychological help for some anxious
 
06:50:34.150 --> 06:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
adolescent who's caught up in a highly
 
06:50:36.708 --> 06:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
charged struggle over gender issues
 
06:50:39.270 --> 06:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
which may in fact be a struggle between
 
06:50:42.390 --> 06:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
the school and the parents
 
06:50:44.788 --> 06:50:44.798 align:start position:0%
it's public knowledge that schools can
 
06:50:47.270 --> 06:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
be heavy-handed in applying their
 
06:50:47.280 --> 06:50:49.270 align:start position:0%
be heavy-handed in applying their
policies

06:50:49.270 --> 06:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
policies
 
06:50:51.190 --> 06:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
someone needs to be a voice for the
 
06:50:54.468 --> 06:50:54.478 align:start position:0%
anxious adolescents out there in need of
 
06:50:56.310 --> 06:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
therapy they can't come forward
 
06:50:58.788 --> 06:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
themselves to report this problem how
 
06:51:01.430 --> 06:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
would they approach the legislature to
 
06:51:03.270 --> 06:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
complain that they can't find a
 
06:51:06.230 --> 06:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
therapist anywhere
 
06:51:10.150 --> 06:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
lastly statute 332l has no enforcement
 
06:51:13.590 --> 06:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
mechanism no sanctions for violations it
 
06:51:16.310 --> 06:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
simply refers any presumed violator to
 
06:51:17.510 --> 06:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
the quote
 
06:51:21.030 --> 06:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
relevant licensing authority for quote
 
06:51:22.548 --> 06:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
such discipline
 
06:51:24.708 --> 06:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
as the relevant licensing authority
 
06:51:29.110 --> 06:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:31.750 --> 06:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
if a client made a complaint
 
06:51:33.430 --> 06:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't go to a court for a fair
 
06:51:35.990 --> 06:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
hearing but to the quote relevant
 
06:51:39.110 --> 06:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
licensing authority
 
06:51:41.750 --> 06:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
this strikes fear into the heart of any
 
06:51:44.468 --> 06:51:44.478 align:start position:0%
therapist all therapists have had
 
06:51:46.868 --> 06:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
experience with hostile
 
06:51:50.548 --> 06:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
or aggrieved clients who wish them harm
 
06:51:53.110 --> 06:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
and who wouldn't mind reporting them to
 
06:51:55.670 --> 06:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
their licensing board
 
06:51:57.510 --> 06:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
and professionals of all kinds are
 
06:51:59.990 --> 06:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
surely daunted by their own particular
 
06:52:02.708 --> 06:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
licensing boards which sometimes
 
06:52:05.350 --> 06:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
function like the proverbial man with a
 
06:52:07.270 --> 06:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
hammer in his hand
 
06:52:09.750 --> 06:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
so every therapist's own license is at
 
06:52:09.760 --> 06:52:12.548 align:start position:0%
so every therapist's own license is at
stake

06:52:12.548 --> 06:52:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:13.670 --> 06:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
in some
 
06:52:13.680 --> 06:52:15.270 align:start position:0%
in some
psychotherapy

06:52:15.270 --> 06:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
psychotherapy
 
06:52:17.030 --> 06:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
must be safe
 
06:52:19.350 --> 06:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
it must be a safe experience for both
 
06:52:22.548 --> 06:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
client and therapist those who seek it
 
06:52:25.190 --> 06:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
are the most vulnerable and they're at
 
06:52:27.910 --> 06:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
their most vulnerable please vote in
 
06:52:30.030 --> 06:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
favor of bill h.r

thank you mr chairman and also thank you
 
06:52:43.670 --> 06:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
dr patek my question
 
06:52:45.510 --> 06:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
um what i'm hearing from your testimony
 
06:52:47.510 --> 06:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
of the written testimony i've looked at
 
06:52:50.390 --> 06:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a
 
06:52:51.990 --> 06:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
level of confusion the way the law is
 
06:52:52.000 --> 06:52:53.030 align:start position:0%
level of confusion the way the law is
written

06:52:53.030 --> 06:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
written
 
06:52:54.310 --> 06:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like that seems to be the
 
06:52:57.190 --> 06:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
essence of it and i think what i
 
06:52:59.350 --> 06:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
have seen so far is
 
06:53:00.788 --> 06:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of times the expertise that you
 
06:53:02.468 --> 06:53:02.478 align:start position:0%
need to write the rules right down to
 
06:53:05.270 --> 06:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
that level our granularity
 
06:53:06.468 --> 06:53:06.478 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't exist in the
 
06:53:08.230 --> 06:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
legislative committee
 
06:53:10.868 --> 06:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
would you be a supportive of trying to
 
06:53:13.190 --> 06:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
then assign a board with the board of
 
06:53:15.350 --> 06:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
psychology mental health and so forth to
 
06:53:17.510 --> 06:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
write the rules to clarify this so
 
06:53:19.750 --> 06:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
therefore we're not repealing it per se
 
06:53:22.628 --> 06:53:22.638 align:start position:0%
but allowing an agency to take a deeper
 
06:53:25.670 --> 06:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
dive into it to provide some guidance
 
06:53:27.270 --> 06:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
that you folks all need
 
06:53:35.270 --> 06:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:38.628 --> 06:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:40.948 --> 06:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
is that working now it is that takes me
 
06:53:44.468 --> 06:53:44.478 align:start position:0%
back to the earlier point of what
 
06:53:47.110 --> 06:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
was it a response to is it a response to
 
06:53:48.548 --> 06:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
any known
 
06:53:51.990 --> 06:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
problem or identified harm
 
06:53:55.190 --> 06:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that there's a need for any
 
06:53:59.510 --> 06:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
bill addressing issues of conversion
 
06:54:02.868 --> 06:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:02.878 --> 06:54:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
why

06:54:03.750 --> 06:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
why
 
06:54:07.510 --> 06:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
try to describe it in granular detail so
 
06:54:09.830 --> 06:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
with all due respect i can't see the use
 
06:54:13.910 --> 06:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:15.910 --> 06:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
06:54:18.390 --> 06:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman
 
06:54:18.400 --> 06:54:19.590 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman
sorry

06:54:19.590 --> 06:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
06:54:21.030 --> 06:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not hiding
 
06:54:21.040 --> 06:54:22.548 align:start position:0%
i'm not hiding
um

06:54:22.548 --> 06:54:22.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:54:25.750 --> 06:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
so i i'm afraid i missed your
 
06:54:28.230 --> 06:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
your initial comments so
 
06:54:30.390 --> 06:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
are you
 
06:54:33.750 --> 06:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
a physician who works with teenagers
 
06:54:36.310 --> 06:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
yes i have worked with teenagers
 
06:54:38.468 --> 06:54:38.478 align:start position:0%
on and off many years in various
 
06:54:38.478 --> 06:54:39.830 align:start position:0%
on and off many years in various
capacities

06:54:39.830 --> 06:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
capacities
 
06:54:42.150 --> 06:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
inpatient outpatient
 
06:54:45.510 --> 06:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
eating disorder programs
 
06:54:49.110 --> 06:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
drug and alcohol programs yes
 
06:54:49.120 --> 06:54:50.868 align:start position:0%
drug and alcohol programs yes
so

06:54:50.868 --> 06:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:54:52.788 --> 06:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
06:54:54.788 --> 06:54:54.798 align:start position:0%
when this bill
 
06:54:56.868 --> 06:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
passed and conversion therapy was
 
06:54:56.878 --> 06:54:57.990 align:start position:0%
passed and conversion therapy was
outlawed

06:54:57.990 --> 06:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
outlawed
 
06:54:59.910 --> 06:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
which is just a few years ago i think
 
06:55:01.350 --> 06:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
within the last
 
06:55:03.030 --> 06:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
four years
 
06:55:05.590 --> 06:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
did did this create a
 
06:55:07.430 --> 06:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
significant change in the way you
 
06:55:09.430 --> 06:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
practice did you stop talking to
 
06:55:09.440 --> 06:55:11.590 align:start position:0%
practice did you stop talking to
adolescents

06:55:11.590 --> 06:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
adolescents
 
06:55:11.600 --> 06:55:12.948 align:start position:0%
adolescents
about

06:55:12.948 --> 06:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:55:12.958 --> 06:55:13.190 align:start position:0%
about
their

06:55:13.190 --> 06:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:55:13.200 --> 06:55:14.390 align:start position:0%
their
[Music]

06:55:14.390 --> 06:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:55:16.548 --> 06:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
questions about identity their questions
 
06:55:19.110 --> 06:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
about sexuality
 
06:55:20.788 --> 06:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
did you
 
06:55:22.788 --> 06:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
turn kids off when they talk to you try
 
06:55:24.150 --> 06:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
to talk to you about those things
 
06:55:26.310 --> 06:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
because you were concerned about the
 
06:55:26.320 --> 06:55:28.310 align:start position:0%
because you were concerned about the
consequences

06:55:28.310 --> 06:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
06:55:33.350 --> 06:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:37.990 --> 06:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
well sir uh in that period of time
 
06:55:39.750 --> 06:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
since i moved to new hampshire five
 
06:55:41.670 --> 06:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
06:55:44.788 --> 06:55:44.798 align:start position:0%
um i have done exclusively inpatient
 
06:55:47.270 --> 06:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
psychotherapy inpatient work
 
06:55:49.110 --> 06:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
in hospitals
 
06:55:52.628 --> 06:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
um so many of the questions surrounding
 
06:55:55.030 --> 06:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy don't apply
 
06:55:56.948 --> 06:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
but some of them do
 
06:55:58.788 --> 06:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
and i would have to say
 
06:56:01.750 --> 06:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
that i myself have been very much more
 
06:56:01.760 --> 06:56:02.868 align:start position:0%
that i myself have been very much more
careful

06:56:02.868 --> 06:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
careful
 
06:56:06.548 --> 06:56:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:09.030 --> 06:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
avoiding them whenever possible
 
06:56:09.040 --> 06:56:10.390 align:start position:0%
avoiding them whenever possible
and

06:56:10.390 --> 06:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:56:12.788 --> 06:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
when i listen
 
06:56:16.548 --> 06:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
to a client who is distressed about some
 
06:56:18.708 --> 06:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
gender issue
 
06:56:21.110 --> 06:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
i feel very brave
 
06:56:23.590 --> 06:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
because i realize that uh
 
06:56:25.590 --> 06:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
that might be forbidden territory and
 
06:56:27.190 --> 06:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
it's hard to tell where the line is
 
06:56:27.200 --> 06:56:28.548 align:start position:0%
it's hard to tell where the line is
drawn

06:56:28.548 --> 06:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
drawn
 
06:56:28.558 --> 06:56:29.830 align:start position:0%
drawn
follow-up

06:56:29.830 --> 06:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:56:29.840 --> 06:56:30.628 align:start position:0%
follow-up
yes

06:56:30.628 --> 06:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:56:32.390 --> 06:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
would you believe that
 
06:56:34.310 --> 06:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
having practiced with adolescents for a
 
06:56:36.310 --> 06:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
very long time that
 
06:56:38.868 --> 06:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
and knowing a lot of other people who do
 
06:56:38.878 --> 06:56:40.390 align:start position:0%
and knowing a lot of other people who do
that

06:56:40.390 --> 06:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:56:44.070 --> 06:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know of anybody who has
 
06:56:46.948 --> 06:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
been more concerned or afraid of talking
 
06:56:51.670 --> 06:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:53.830 --> 06:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
my sense is that there are more and more
 
06:56:53.840 --> 06:56:55.030 align:start position:0%
my sense is that there are more and more
therapists

06:56:55.030 --> 06:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
therapists
 
06:56:56.468 --> 06:56:56.478 align:start position:0%
who are
 
06:56:58.548 --> 06:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
increasingly comfortable talking about
 
06:57:00.548 --> 06:57:00.558 align:start position:0%
these issues as these issues have become
 
06:57:06.070 --> 06:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:07.990 --> 06:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
i'm surprised i think
 
06:57:10.468 --> 06:57:10.478 align:start position:0%
our acquaintances don't overlap greatly
 
06:57:13.030 --> 06:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
because i know so many who are we should
 
06:57:17.830 --> 06:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:20.150 --> 06:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for the doctor
 
06:57:22.708 --> 06:57:22.718 align:start position:0%
representative leon um thank you mr
 
06:57:24.310 --> 06:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you doctor for being
 
06:57:27.030 --> 06:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
here and taking these questions uh
 
06:57:28.788 --> 06:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
is it um
 
06:57:32.070 --> 06:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
accepted practice for a therapist to
 
06:57:34.390 --> 06:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
guide an intended outcome with their
 
06:57:34.400 --> 06:57:35.350 align:start position:0%
guide an intended outcome with their
patient

06:57:35.350 --> 06:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
patient
 
06:57:35.360 --> 06:57:36.468 align:start position:0%
patient
no

06:57:36.468 --> 06:57:36.478 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:57:38.868 --> 06:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
so it really is not unless you're in
 
06:57:40.708 --> 06:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
drug and alcohol therapy
 
06:57:42.390 --> 06:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
and then of course there's an outcome
 
06:57:44.788 --> 06:57:44.798 align:start position:0%
that is sought but that's agreed upon in
 
06:57:44.798 --> 06:57:46.390 align:start position:0%
that is sought but that's agreed upon in
advance

06:57:46.390 --> 06:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
advance
 
06:57:48.548 --> 06:57:48.558 align:start position:0%
and follow-up follow-up and would that
 
06:57:50.708 --> 06:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
then mean that conversion therapy as
 
06:57:52.628 --> 06:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
it's laid out is already a violation of
 
06:57:54.390 --> 06:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
the code of ethics and already would be
 
06:57:59.590 --> 06:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:02.628 --> 06:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
whenever i hear it described
 
06:58:04.788 --> 06:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
i've never heard you know case studies
 
06:58:06.230 --> 06:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
of it
 
06:58:08.070 --> 06:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
yes it does seem to be something that
 
06:58:10.468 --> 06:58:10.478 align:start position:0%
would be in violation of general
 
06:58:13.030 --> 06:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
standards of the licensing boards
 
06:58:14.708 --> 06:58:14.718 align:start position:0%
if it's coercive
 
06:58:18.070 --> 06:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
if it's not a matter of
 
06:58:23.590 --> 06:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:25.590 --> 06:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
06:58:29.350 --> 06:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:31.350 --> 06:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah sure
 
06:58:33.190 --> 06:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
06:58:36.310 --> 06:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
06:58:37.990 --> 06:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
it seems pl
 
06:58:39.350 --> 06:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
i'll make a statement you tell me
 
06:58:41.190 --> 06:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's true or false or whether
 
06:58:42.230 --> 06:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
you agree
 
06:58:44.548 --> 06:58:44.558 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the real problem is
 
06:58:47.270 --> 06:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
when a child or teen comes to you and
 
06:58:51.270 --> 06:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
says i'm feeling like i'm not the right
 
06:58:53.110 --> 06:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not feeling like the sex that
 
06:58:54.788 --> 06:58:54.798 align:start position:0%
physically i am
 
06:58:57.190 --> 06:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
and i don't like it
 
06:59:00.230 --> 06:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
and i want to change i want to be like
 
06:59:02.868 --> 06:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
what i think everybody else is at that
 
06:59:02.878 --> 06:59:04.070 align:start position:0%
what i think everybody else is at that
point

06:59:04.070 --> 06:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
point
 
06:59:06.868 --> 06:59:06.878 align:start position:0%
the child or the team
 
06:59:08.868 --> 06:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
is directing
 
06:59:11.510 --> 06:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
to change how they feel
 
06:59:13.270 --> 06:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
that seems to me
 
06:59:15.750 --> 06:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
where the danger is because if you help
 
06:59:15.760 --> 06:59:17.350 align:start position:0%
where the danger is because if you help
them

06:59:17.350 --> 06:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:59:19.350 --> 06:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
try to change
 
06:59:21.110 --> 06:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
then it sounds like you're being
 
06:59:21.120 --> 06:59:22.468 align:start position:0%
then it sounds like you're being
coercive

06:59:22.468 --> 06:59:22.478 align:start position:0%
coercive
 
06:59:25.670 --> 06:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
so is that the real scary issue for a
 
06:59:25.680 --> 06:59:30.468 align:start position:0%
so is that the real scary issue for a
psychologist

06:59:30.468 --> 06:59:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:33.110 --> 06:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
well whatever you do in that situation
 
06:59:35.910 --> 06:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
you are at risk of being
 
06:59:39.110 --> 06:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:41.670 --> 06:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
introducing change or promoting change
 
06:59:43.110 --> 06:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
you know that's
 
06:59:47.590 --> 06:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:47.600 --> 06:59:49.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:59:49.670 --> 06:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:59:52.628 --> 06:59:52.638 align:start position:0%
it's not so much an issue of what
 
06:59:54.628 --> 06:59:54.638 align:start position:0%
the adolescent
 
06:59:56.390 --> 06:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
asks you to do
 
07:00:00.070 --> 07:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's the whole territory if it
 
07:00:04.230 --> 07:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:09.910 --> 07:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:12.948 --> 07:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
representative cannon
 
07:00:14.310 --> 07:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:00:16.628 --> 07:00:16.638 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
07:00:21.590 --> 07:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:24.070 --> 07:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:26.628 --> 07:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
would you consider it inappropriate
 
07:00:29.590 --> 07:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
for a parent to bring their child in to
 
07:00:32.788 --> 07:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
see a therapist where the parent is
 
07:00:34.628 --> 07:00:34.638 align:start position:0%
telling the therapist what they expect
 
07:00:37.750 --> 07:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:40.070 --> 07:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
well i would consider it inappropriate
 
07:00:42.390 --> 07:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
for the therapist to take marching
 
07:00:44.708 --> 07:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
orders from the parent
 
07:00:47.110 --> 07:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
i think the therapist would need to sit
 
07:00:49.430 --> 07:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
down with the family and figure out what
 
07:00:52.070 --> 07:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
was going on underneath
 
07:00:53.670 --> 07:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's inappropriate for the
 
07:00:55.430 --> 07:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
parent to
 
07:00:58.788 --> 07:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
to you know see a therapist or
 
07:01:01.190 --> 07:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
request an audience with a therapist but
 
07:01:03.830 --> 07:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
for the therapist to say well yes i'll
 
07:01:06.548 --> 07:01:06.558 align:start position:0%
change your child for you that would be
 
07:01:08.708 --> 07:01:08.718 align:start position:0%
terribly inappropriate
 
07:01:10.830 --> 07:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
follow on follow
 
07:01:10.840 --> 07:01:12.548 align:start position:0%
follow on follow

07:01:12.548 --> 07:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
up
 
07:01:12.558 --> 07:01:14.310 align:start position:0%

um
 
07:01:16.230 --> 07:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
would you would you believe that
 
07:01:16.240 --> 07:01:17.590 align:start position:0%
would you would you believe that
um

07:01:17.590 --> 07:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:01:19.110 --> 07:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
originally when this bill was brought
 
07:01:21.510 --> 07:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
forward a few years ago that part of the
 
07:01:23.270 --> 07:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
concern in the
 
07:01:25.190 --> 07:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
transgender community especially was
 
07:01:25.200 --> 07:01:26.468 align:start position:0%
transgender community especially was
that

07:01:26.468 --> 07:01:26.478 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:01:28.628 --> 07:01:28.638 align:start position:0%
many um there were many situations
 
07:01:31.750 --> 07:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the country that were
 
07:01:34.628 --> 07:01:34.638 align:start position:0%
parents working with
 
07:01:37.910 --> 07:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
quote unquote therapists were trying to
 
07:01:39.190 --> 07:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
change the
 
07:01:41.430 --> 07:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
what the child was thinking
 
07:01:43.830 --> 07:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
and that and that this bill originally
 
07:01:47.350 --> 07:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
with good intentions was to try and
 
07:01:49.670 --> 07:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh circumvent that before it started in
 
07:01:52.548 --> 07:01:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:54.708 --> 07:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
so would you
 
07:01:54.718 --> 07:01:56.230 align:start position:0%
so would you
um

07:01:56.230 --> 07:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:01:59.270 --> 07:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
would you consider if this group were to
 
07:02:01.510 --> 07:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
bring forth an amendment at least
 
07:02:03.910 --> 07:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
reading it through before we decide to
 
07:02:06.230 --> 07:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
do anything
 
07:02:06.240 --> 07:02:07.510 align:start position:0%
do anything
consider

07:02:07.510 --> 07:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
consider
 
07:02:09.670 --> 07:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
consider reviewing an amendment to this
 
07:02:11.910 --> 07:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
bill that's being brought forward to
 
07:02:13.590 --> 07:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
help clarify
 
07:02:15.430 --> 07:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
the difference between coercion and
 
07:02:17.190 --> 07:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
regular therapy
 
07:02:19.670 --> 07:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
i certainly wouldn't rule out
 
07:02:22.468 --> 07:02:22.478 align:start position:0%
reviewing an amendment yeah thank you
 
07:02:22.478 --> 07:02:25.590 align:start position:0%
reviewing an amendment yeah thank you
sure

07:02:25.590 --> 07:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:28.548 --> 07:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
07:02:30.150 --> 07:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
07:02:33.110 --> 07:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
07:02:36.948 --> 07:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
do you think that there is a chance
 
07:02:39.910 --> 07:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
of a poor outcome
 
07:02:43.830 --> 07:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
if because of the fear of therapists who
 
07:02:46.548 --> 07:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
are licensed and trained
 
07:02:50.230 --> 07:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
to work with these young people who are
 
07:02:52.708 --> 07:02:52.718 align:start position:0%
desperately seeking for help
 
07:02:55.110 --> 07:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
do you fear that they may then end up
 
07:02:57.590 --> 07:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
going to people who are not trained and
 
07:02:59.990 --> 07:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
getting their information
 
07:03:01.910 --> 07:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly from
 
07:03:06.548 --> 07:03:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:12.070 --> 07:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:13.590 --> 07:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
i can't say that
 
07:03:16.830 --> 07:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
i have experience of that
 
07:03:22.708 --> 07:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:37.270 --> 07:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:40.070 --> 07:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
see now that's a simple answer
 
07:03:43.110 --> 07:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you very much mister
 
07:03:44.868 --> 07:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
sure i think there is a distinction to
 
07:03:46.708 --> 07:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
be made that couldn't be answered before
 
07:03:48.468 --> 07:03:48.478 align:start position:0%
there are having
 
07:03:50.548 --> 07:03:50.558 align:start position:0%
worked in community mental health for
 
07:03:52.788 --> 07:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
48 50 years actually
 
07:03:54.708 --> 07:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
saw a number of children who have been
 
07:03:56.708 --> 07:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
in that sort of situation
 
07:03:58.310 --> 07:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
there is a distinction to be made
 
07:03:58.320 --> 07:03:59.510 align:start position:0%
there is a distinction to be made
between

07:03:59.510 --> 07:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
between
 
07:04:02.230 --> 07:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria which is really
 
07:04:04.868 --> 07:04:04.878 align:start position:0%
kids feeling very confused and upset
 
07:04:06.310 --> 07:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
during an age period where they're
 
07:04:07.910 --> 07:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
trying to settle
 
07:04:09.910 --> 07:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
sexual identity anyway and they can
 
07:04:12.150 --> 07:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
become very confused and that leads to
 
07:04:14.628 --> 07:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
being upset and i think a therapist
 
07:04:16.310 --> 07:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
who then tries to help them with a
 
07:04:18.150 --> 07:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
feeling of upset
 
07:04:20.948 --> 07:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
not the gender issues that
 
07:04:23.110 --> 07:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
may have some played some role in
 
07:04:25.590 --> 07:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
fostering it comes along but the thing
 
07:04:28.390 --> 07:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
that disturbs me and i heard reports of
 
07:04:30.708 --> 07:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
this both from national organizations
 
07:04:32.548 --> 07:04:32.558 align:start position:0%
and from people that i'd seen
 
07:04:35.990 --> 07:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
i talked with a couple of kids who had
 
07:04:37.670 --> 07:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
collision therapy
 
07:04:38.868 --> 07:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
and the
 
07:04:40.548 --> 07:04:40.558 align:start position:0%
procedures that they went through with
 
07:04:43.030 --> 07:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
barbaric to say the least in many
 
07:04:45.510 --> 07:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
situations and it was very very damaging
 
07:04:46.468 --> 07:04:46.478 align:start position:0%
to them
 
07:04:46.478 --> 07:04:47.190 align:start position:0%
to them
and

07:04:47.190 --> 07:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:04:49.750 --> 07:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
i i don't have any identity of any
 
07:04:51.830 --> 07:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
particular people that did it
 
07:04:53.670 --> 07:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
often at times but
 
07:04:55.110 --> 07:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
some of them may not have even occurred
 
07:04:56.390 --> 07:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
around here because i really wasn't
 
07:04:58.548 --> 07:04:58.558 align:start position:0%
interested in looking for the exact
 
07:05:00.788 --> 07:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
villains that did this but it really is
 
07:05:03.830 --> 07:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
a very coercive treatment but i think we
 
07:05:06.070 --> 07:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
need to make a distinction that
 
07:05:08.788 --> 07:05:08.798 align:start position:0%
we need to do away with these forced
 
07:05:10.390 --> 07:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
coercive methods
 
07:05:12.948 --> 07:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
to change someone's sexual identity
 
07:05:15.270 --> 07:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
often it's someone else's request
 
07:05:17.190 --> 07:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
either a parent or a school or somebody
 
07:05:19.750 --> 07:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
says i don't want you to be a gay person
 
07:05:21.350 --> 07:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
i want you to come back to being a
 
07:05:21.360 --> 07:05:22.468 align:start position:0%
i want you to come back to being a
regular

07:05:22.468 --> 07:05:22.478 align:start position:0%
regular
 
07:05:25.350 --> 07:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
bisexual person but those are
 
07:05:27.590 --> 07:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
wrong and there's absolutely no evidence
 
07:05:29.670 --> 07:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere there's any treatment method
 
07:05:31.110 --> 07:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
that's going to accomplish that sure but
 
07:05:32.468 --> 07:05:32.478 align:start position:0%
i know of
 
07:05:34.788 --> 07:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
but the distinction really is and i
 
07:05:37.350 --> 07:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
think you've already said that if a kid
 
07:05:39.270 --> 07:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
is very confused about where he's at at
 
07:05:41.670 --> 07:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
any given point that is something that
 
07:05:43.830 --> 07:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
you can quite successfully work at and
 
07:05:46.390 --> 07:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
try to help him deal with
 
07:05:48.230 --> 07:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
would you say let me just make a blanket
 
07:05:49.990 --> 07:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
statement that any
 
07:05:52.548 --> 07:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
therapy that is coercive
 
07:05:56.310 --> 07:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:57.910 --> 07:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:06:00.150 --> 07:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the doctor

07:06:04.070 --> 07:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
07:06:07.110 --> 07:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
dr jameson if you could put yourself in
 
07:06:08.628 --> 07:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
the mind of
 
07:06:11.270 --> 07:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
um an honor student at harvard medical
 
07:06:13.350 --> 07:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
school in the mid 70s
 
07:06:16.070 --> 07:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps someone working with the like of
 
07:06:18.628 --> 07:06:18.638 align:start position:0%
arthur kleinman even
 
07:06:21.190 --> 07:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
would you say that we have made
 
07:06:23.670 --> 07:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
remarkable progress
 
07:06:26.310 --> 07:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
in our treatment of adolescents
 
07:06:28.628 --> 07:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
in areas of gender
 
07:06:30.548 --> 07:06:30.558 align:start position:0%
and maybe we should just let the
 
07:06:33.910 --> 07:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
legislation stand and walk away from it
 
07:06:41.670 --> 07:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:46.548 --> 07:06:46.558 align:start position:0%
i i can't find my way to that sir
 
07:06:48.390 --> 07:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
i really cannot see
 
07:06:51.350 --> 07:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
that there is tremendous progress
 
07:06:55.670 --> 07:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
in dealing with adolescent gender issues
 
07:06:57.948 --> 07:06:57.958 align:start position:0%
which are
 
07:06:57.958 --> 07:06:59.750 align:start position:0%
which are
epidemiologically

07:06:59.750 --> 07:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
epidemiologically
 
07:07:02.948 --> 07:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
rampant now in comparison with the 70s
 
07:07:05.350 --> 07:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
one could ask why are there four times
 
07:07:06.390 --> 07:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
as many
 
07:07:08.948 --> 07:07:08.958 align:start position:0%
adolescents confused about their gender
 
07:07:08.958 --> 07:07:09.830 align:start position:0%
adolescents confused about their gender
and

07:07:09.830 --> 07:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:07:11.990 --> 07:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
how does one help them
 
07:07:12.000 --> 07:07:16.070 align:start position:0%
how does one help them
um

07:07:16.070 --> 07:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:19.830 --> 07:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:22.788 --> 07:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm wondering how your
 
07:07:26.390 --> 07:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh position squares with what appears to
 
07:07:29.030 --> 07:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
me to be the position of the american
 
07:07:31.830 --> 07:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
psychiatric association
 
07:07:34.788 --> 07:07:34.798 align:start position:0%
which says among other things that the
 
07:07:37.510 --> 07:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
apa encourages legislation which would
 
07:07:40.150 --> 07:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
prohibit the practice of reparative or
 
07:07:41.990 --> 07:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
conversion therapies
 
07:07:43.830 --> 07:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
that are based on the a priori
 
07:07:45.430 --> 07:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
assumption that diverse sexual
 
07:07:47.430 --> 07:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
orientations and general gender
 
07:07:52.468 --> 07:07:52.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:55.350 --> 07:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
well that a priori assumption if in fact
 
07:07:55.360 --> 07:07:56.230 align:start position:0%
well that a priori assumption if in fact
they're

07:07:56.230 --> 07:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
they're
 
07:07:59.590 --> 07:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
basing their position on that
 
07:08:02.868 --> 07:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
i disagree with that a priori assumption
 
07:08:04.948 --> 07:08:04.958 align:start position:0%
but i also disagree with the apa's
 
07:08:06.310 --> 07:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
conclusion there
 
07:08:08.390 --> 07:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
and i certainly don't
 
07:08:11.190 --> 07:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
agree with the apa in lockstep i think
 
07:08:13.750 --> 07:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
that they are quite wrong about that
 
07:08:13.760 --> 07:08:16.868 align:start position:0%
that they are quite wrong about that
yes

07:08:16.868 --> 07:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:18.788 --> 07:08:18.798 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands up thank you so
 
07:08:20.708 --> 07:08:20.718 align:start position:0%

location at butler
 
07:08:53.670 --> 07:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
and um i'm going to take this down a
 
07:08:55.670 --> 07:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
little different road
 
07:08:55.680 --> 07:08:56.788 align:start position:0%
little different road
uh

07:08:56.788 --> 07:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:08:59.750 --> 07:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
when my now husband les and i were
 
07:09:02.948 --> 07:09:02.958 align:start position:0%
beginning our life together about 44 ish
 
07:09:04.390 --> 07:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
07:09:06.150 --> 07:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
it was time when gay and lesbian couples
 
07:09:08.628 --> 07:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
didn't often have children
 
07:09:10.310 --> 07:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
unless they had kids from a previous
 
07:09:12.310 --> 07:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
marriage we talked about whether we
 
07:09:14.230 --> 07:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring a son or daughter into
 
07:09:15.510 --> 07:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
our lives
 
07:09:18.070 --> 07:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
but it was not a time when acceptance of
 
07:09:20.708 --> 07:09:20.718 align:start position:0%
same-sex families was as prevalent as it
 
07:09:23.270 --> 07:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
is today i think we would have been
 
07:09:24.628 --> 07:09:24.638 align:start position:0%
great parents
 
07:09:26.310 --> 07:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
but the lack of societal support
 
07:09:27.830 --> 07:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
deterred us
 
07:09:30.868 --> 07:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
these days many gay and lesbian couples
 
07:09:32.708 --> 07:09:32.718 align:start position:0%
do have kids
 
07:09:32.718 --> 07:09:33.590 align:start position:0%
do have kids
when

07:09:33.590 --> 07:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
when
 
07:09:36.230 --> 07:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
we have friends a young gay couple up in
 
07:09:38.150 --> 07:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
bretton woods who have built an
 
07:09:40.390 --> 07:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
impressive hospitality business
 
07:09:43.270 --> 07:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
they've adopted two kids a few years ago
 
07:09:45.750 --> 07:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
brother and sister the boy is now eight
 
07:09:47.350 --> 07:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
and the girl's six
 
07:09:49.830 --> 07:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
they are a wonderful vibrant and happy
 
07:09:49.840 --> 07:09:51.270 align:start position:0%
they are a wonderful vibrant and happy
family

07:09:51.270 --> 07:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
family
 
07:09:52.948 --> 07:09:52.958 align:start position:0%
gay and lesbian couples with children
 
07:09:55.110 --> 07:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
understand that their kids need to grow
 
07:09:57.910 --> 07:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
into their own sexual identity whatever
 
07:09:59.030 --> 07:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
that is
 
07:10:01.110 --> 07:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
that is their responsibility as a parent
 
07:10:02.788 --> 07:10:02.798 align:start position:0%
to nurture and support their child's
 
07:10:05.510 --> 07:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
growth one aspect of which is a healthy
 
07:10:08.390 --> 07:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
sexuality and gender identity
 
07:10:10.150 --> 07:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
whatever that aspect
 
07:10:12.548 --> 07:10:12.558 align:start position:0%
of which yeah i'm sorry it would be
 
07:10:14.468 --> 07:10:14.478 align:start position:0%
absurd to consider that children of gay
 
07:10:16.868 --> 07:10:16.878 align:start position:0%
or lesbian couples should be counseled
 
07:10:19.830 --> 07:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
against heterosexual yearnings simply
 
07:10:21.830 --> 07:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
because of the environment they grew up
 
07:10:24.390 --> 07:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
in was with gay parents
 
07:10:26.150 --> 07:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's the same if you turn the construct
 
07:10:27.990 --> 07:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
around to the children of heterosexual
 
07:10:30.070 --> 07:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
couples it would be absurd if their
 
07:10:31.910 --> 07:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
children who have normal healthy
 
07:10:34.548 --> 07:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
homosexual yearnings should be sent to a
 
07:10:36.628 --> 07:10:36.638 align:start position:0%
licensed professional to tell them that
 
07:10:38.788 --> 07:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
those yearnings are wrong
 
07:10:40.868 --> 07:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
that they are defective because of those
 
07:10:40.878 --> 07:10:42.628 align:start position:0%
that they are defective because of those
feelings

07:10:42.628 --> 07:10:42.638 align:start position:0%
feelings
 
07:10:44.708 --> 07:10:44.718 align:start position:0%
all parents want to have their kids to
 
07:10:47.430 --> 07:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
have safe and secure childhood and to
 
07:10:49.510 --> 07:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
grow into a happy healthy and successful
 
07:10:49.520 --> 07:10:50.548 align:start position:0%
grow into a happy healthy and successful
life

07:10:50.548 --> 07:10:50.558 align:start position:0%
life
 
07:10:52.310 --> 07:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
sending your child into conversion
 
07:10:54.390 --> 07:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
therapy doesn't support their growth
 
07:10:57.670 --> 07:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
into a strong and happy adult but rather
 
07:11:00.310 --> 07:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
reinforces shame and dissonance about
 
07:11:01.830 --> 07:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
who they are
 
07:11:03.430 --> 07:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
according to the world psychiatric
 
07:11:05.190 --> 07:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
association statement denouncing the
 
07:11:07.030 --> 07:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
harmful and discredited practice of
 
07:11:09.510 --> 07:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy there is no sound
 
07:11:12.150 --> 07:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence that innate sexual
 
07:11:14.948 --> 07:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
orientation can be changed and
 
07:11:17.110 --> 07:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
the provision of any intervention
 
07:11:19.430 --> 07:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
support purporting to treat something
 
07:11:21.510 --> 07:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
that is not a disorder is wholly
 
07:11:21.520 --> 07:11:23.190 align:start position:0%
that is not a disorder is wholly
unethical

07:11:23.190 --> 07:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
unethical
 
07:11:25.590 --> 07:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
there are already laws preventing other
 
07:11:28.708 --> 07:11:28.718 align:start position:0%
forms of child endangerment the existing
 
07:11:31.110 --> 07:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
ban on conversion therapy joins those
 
07:11:33.190 --> 07:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
laws and makes it clear to parents that
 
07:11:35.430 --> 07:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
it is dangerous to their child is
 
07:11:37.910 --> 07:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
discredited by the medical community and
 
07:11:40.310 --> 07:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
has no legitimate purpose
 
07:11:42.070 --> 07:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
the ban protects parents from being
 
07:11:44.628 --> 07:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of by practitioners of
 
07:11:47.510 --> 07:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
harmful therapy practices
 
07:11:49.350 --> 07:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
we should not be telling kids who have
 
07:11:51.670 --> 07:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
same sex attractions or kids who have
 
07:11:53.750 --> 07:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
questions about their gender expression
 
07:11:55.270 --> 07:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
that they are wrong to have those
 
07:11:55.280 --> 07:11:56.548 align:start position:0%
that they are wrong to have those
feelings

07:11:56.548 --> 07:11:56.558 align:start position:0%
feelings
 
07:11:58.468 --> 07:11:58.478 align:start position:0%
the damage that conversion therapy can
 
07:12:00.948 --> 07:12:00.958 align:start position:0%
do has been shown and the professional
 
07:12:02.948 --> 07:12:02.958 align:start position:0%
counseling therapy communities have
 
07:12:02.958 --> 07:12:04.788 align:start position:0%
counseling therapy communities have
repudiated

07:12:04.788 --> 07:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
repudiated
 
07:12:08.230 --> 07:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
the ban on conversion therapy hb 587
 
07:12:11.270 --> 07:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
which had bipartisan sponsorship
 
07:12:13.270 --> 07:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
passed in 2018 and was signed by
 
07:12:14.788 --> 07:12:14.798 align:start position:0%
governor sununu
 
07:12:16.628 --> 07:12:16.638 align:start position:0%
it says that we value the health and

all of our children
 
07:12:24.548 --> 07:12:24.558 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be undone thank you and i'm
 
07:12:29.510 --> 07:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:32.868 --> 07:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
representative um i certainly
 
07:12:34.788 --> 07:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
stand with i think just about everybody
 
07:12:36.948 --> 07:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
else who says coercive
 
07:12:38.948 --> 07:12:38.958 align:start position:0%
counseling is
 
07:12:41.430 --> 07:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
not good at all
 
07:12:44.948 --> 07:12:44.958 align:start position:0%
but i do know some people who for
 
07:12:47.510 --> 07:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
the first 20 years of
 
07:12:50.468 --> 07:12:50.478 align:start position:0%
their adult life
 
07:12:52.788 --> 07:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
identified in one way
 
07:12:52.798 --> 07:12:55.110 align:start position:0%
identified in one way
and

07:12:55.110 --> 07:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:57.430 --> 07:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
through a process or through
 
07:12:59.430 --> 07:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
a period of time
 
07:13:01.830 --> 07:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
then spent the next years of their life
 
07:13:05.750 --> 07:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:07.670 --> 07:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
i know those people it wasn't just a
 
07:13:09.590 --> 07:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
quick thing it wasn't forced nobody had
 
07:13:11.670 --> 07:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
a gun to his head
 
07:13:14.468 --> 07:13:14.478 align:start position:0%
but they changed and and this is in both
 
07:13:18.230 --> 07:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
directions of the subject so
 
07:13:19.590 --> 07:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
i would
 
07:13:20.788 --> 07:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
hold out
 
07:13:20.798 --> 07:13:22.390 align:start position:0%
hold out
that

07:13:22.390 --> 07:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:13:26.070 --> 07:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
at least as my small apprehension of
 
07:13:26.080 --> 07:13:27.190 align:start position:0%
at least as my small apprehension of
truth

07:13:27.190 --> 07:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
truth
 
07:13:27.200 --> 07:13:28.548 align:start position:0%
truth
that

07:13:28.548 --> 07:13:28.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:13:30.310 --> 07:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
what do you think of that
 
07:13:33.190 --> 07:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
we have had this discussion before
 
07:13:37.590 --> 07:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
and um it is absolutely imperative that
 
07:13:40.468 --> 07:13:40.478 align:start position:0%
support for people who are exploring
 
07:13:43.830 --> 07:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
a variety of conflicts in their
 
07:13:45.750 --> 07:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
growth and development
 
07:13:48.310 --> 07:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
deserve to have the support
 
07:13:49.990 --> 07:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
that they need
 
07:13:51.350 --> 07:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
either through their family through
 
07:13:54.150 --> 07:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
their churches through their
 
07:13:56.390 --> 07:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
health care communities however that is
 
07:13:56.400 --> 07:13:57.830 align:start position:0%
health care communities however that is
possible

07:13:57.830 --> 07:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
possible
 
07:13:57.840 --> 07:13:58.628 align:start position:0%
possible
what

07:13:58.628 --> 07:13:58.638 align:start position:0%
what
 
07:14:01.990 --> 07:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy does is say
 
07:14:05.510 --> 07:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
what you are experiencing is wrong
 
07:14:07.990 --> 07:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
that is bad and i think most everyone
 
07:14:10.708 --> 07:14:10.718 align:start position:0%
agrees to that that's what this bill is
 
07:14:13.270 --> 07:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
about it is not about
 
07:14:13.280 --> 07:14:14.310 align:start position:0%
about it is not about
um

07:14:14.310 --> 07:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:14:14.320 --> 07:14:16.868 align:start position:0%
um
threatening

07:14:16.868 --> 07:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
threatening
 
07:14:20.310 --> 07:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
the therapy community with
 
07:14:22.468 --> 07:14:22.478 align:start position:0%
helping um
 
07:14:22.478 --> 07:14:23.350 align:start position:0%
helping um
through

07:14:23.350 --> 07:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
through
 
07:14:25.350 --> 07:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
the growth and development of teens and
 
07:14:28.708 --> 07:14:28.718 align:start position:0%
young adults to explore their sexuality
 
07:14:30.628 --> 07:14:30.638 align:start position:0%
their gender identity and their
 
07:14:30.638 --> 07:14:31.990 align:start position:0%
their gender identity and their
conflicts

07:14:31.990 --> 07:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
conflicts
 
07:14:32.000 --> 07:14:33.910 align:start position:0%
conflicts
over

07:14:33.910 --> 07:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
over
 
07:14:36.468 --> 07:14:36.478 align:start position:0%
becoming an adult
 
07:14:40.628 --> 07:14:40.638 align:start position:0%
i was a psychiatric nurse for 15 years
 
07:14:42.948 --> 07:14:42.958 align:start position:0%
i worked in the health care community
 
07:14:46.310 --> 07:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
for more years than that
 
07:14:49.750 --> 07:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
and i was a
 
07:14:52.310 --> 07:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
struggling young adult for
 
07:14:53.590 --> 07:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
several years
 
07:14:53.600 --> 07:14:54.468 align:start position:0%
several years
and

07:14:54.468 --> 07:14:54.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:14:57.910 --> 07:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
had incredibly positive experiences with
 
07:15:01.430 --> 07:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
therapy helping me to understand
 
07:15:03.190 --> 07:15:03.200 align:start position:0%
the ground that i was standing on the
 
07:15:05.910 --> 07:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
relationships that i was exploring and
 
07:15:08.868 --> 07:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
the conflicts with family and community
 
07:15:10.948 --> 07:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
that kind of therapy is incredibly
 
07:15:13.270 --> 07:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
important which which is which i
 
07:15:14.948 --> 07:15:14.958 align:start position:0%
understand but it really wasn't my
 
07:15:17.270 --> 07:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
question i know but it is part of the
 
07:15:21.270 --> 07:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
process and it is i think the basis of
 
07:15:23.430 --> 07:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
what we're hearing
 
07:15:25.350 --> 07:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
remember that time we debated on channel
 
07:15:29.190 --> 07:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
nine you won and i said
 
07:15:31.110 --> 07:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
you can outclass me in a debate all
 
07:15:31.120 --> 07:15:32.310 align:start position:0%
you can outclass me in a debate all
right

07:15:32.310 --> 07:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:15:34.070 --> 07:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
07:15:36.628 --> 07:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
07:15:38.310 --> 07:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you very
 
07:15:40.868 --> 07:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
much for coming and
 
07:15:43.350 --> 07:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
i have again i have a question
 
07:15:45.510 --> 07:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
that am i understanding you right that
 
07:15:48.390 --> 07:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
the most important aspect of counseling
 
07:15:50.628 --> 07:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
for a kid who either
 
07:15:53.270 --> 07:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
feels strongly
 
07:15:56.150 --> 07:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
and and says it's not standard so it's
 
07:15:58.548 --> 07:15:58.558 align:start position:0%
kind of concerning me or is really
 
07:15:59.910 --> 07:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
questioning doesn't know where they
 
07:16:02.628 --> 07:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
stand and are feeling really lost
 
07:16:04.788 --> 07:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
would you say that the most important
 
07:16:08.548 --> 07:16:08.558 align:start position:0%
part of counseling is acceptance
 
07:16:10.788 --> 07:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
and helping them deal with people who
 
07:16:12.708 --> 07:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
aren't accepting
 
07:16:15.430 --> 07:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely um
 
07:16:17.670 --> 07:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
you know for all of us
 
07:16:19.590 --> 07:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
trying to find acceptance is always a
 
07:16:21.510 --> 07:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
challenge um
 
07:16:24.390 --> 07:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
but when we are entering
 
07:16:26.628 --> 07:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
an area that is
 
07:16:29.110 --> 07:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
psychologically fraught
 
07:16:30.628 --> 07:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
because of
 
07:16:33.590 --> 07:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
the history of acceptance of say lgbt
 
07:16:36.230 --> 07:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
experiences it becomes more difficult
 
07:16:37.830 --> 07:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
and especially when you come from a
 
07:16:40.868 --> 07:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
family that may not support or
 
07:16:44.468 --> 07:16:44.478 align:start position:0%
believe that what you are experiencing
 
07:16:47.030 --> 07:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
is good or healthy and may be damaging
 
07:16:48.708 --> 07:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
and your family cares
 
07:16:50.468 --> 07:16:50.478 align:start position:0%
desperately about you and doesn't want
 
07:16:51.990 --> 07:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
you to go there
 
07:16:53.830 --> 07:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
the the
 
07:16:53.840 --> 07:16:55.270 align:start position:0%
the the
best

07:16:55.270 --> 07:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
best
 
07:16:58.948 --> 07:16:58.958 align:start position:0%
treatment is acceptance and support and
 
07:17:01.350 --> 07:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
allowing someone to grow through that
 
07:17:01.360 --> 07:17:06.230 align:start position:0%
allowing someone to grow through that
experience

07:17:06.230 --> 07:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:07.990 --> 07:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
07:17:11.110 --> 07:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:15.110 --> 07:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
next we call up taylor largman from unh
 
07:17:15.120 --> 07:17:23.910 align:start position:0%
next we call up taylor largman from unh
law

07:17:23.910 --> 07:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:26.948 --> 07:17:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:28.548 --> 07:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
my name is taylor largeman and i'm the
 
07:17:30.868 --> 07:17:30.878 align:start position:0%
president of lambda at the university of
 
07:17:33.110 --> 07:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire school of law
 
07:17:37.590 --> 07:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
lambda formerly opposes hb 1077
 
07:17:40.468 --> 07:17:40.478 align:start position:0%
because conversion therapy is hateful
 
07:17:42.868 --> 07:17:42.878 align:start position:0%
it's trans and homophobic
 
07:17:46.548 --> 07:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:48.468 --> 07:17:48.478 align:start position:0%
in response to um the sponsor's
 
07:17:51.670 --> 07:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
testimony a few minutes ago this body
 
07:17:53.750 --> 07:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
would create a slippery slope that
 
07:17:55.350 --> 07:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
people can understand
 
07:17:57.830 --> 07:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
if people were to understand liberally
 
07:17:57.840 --> 07:17:58.868 align:start position:0%
if people were to understand liberally
um

07:17:58.868 --> 07:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:18:01.510 --> 07:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
the concept behind it so locking like
 
07:18:03.830 --> 07:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
the locking in the closet um
 
07:18:05.510 --> 07:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
referred to earlier
 
07:18:09.110 --> 07:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
is by no means um on par with the
 
07:18:10.708 --> 07:18:10.718 align:start position:0%
need to
 
07:18:13.110 --> 07:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
ban conversion therapy
 
07:18:14.708 --> 07:18:14.718 align:start position:0%
so what is conversion therapy because it
 
07:18:16.230 --> 07:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
seems that we seem to be talking without
 
07:18:18.670 --> 07:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
really a solid definition um it's the
 
07:18:21.350 --> 07:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
pseudo-scientific practice of attempting
 
07:18:22.868 --> 07:18:22.878 align:start position:0%
to force someone
 
07:18:25.430 --> 07:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
to change their sexuality and gender
 
07:18:30.310 --> 07:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
identity to heterosexual and cisgender
 
07:18:31.990 --> 07:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
through psychiatric physical or
 
07:18:34.150 --> 07:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
spiritual means
 
07:18:36.628 --> 07:18:36.638 align:start position:0%
it completely lacks any scientific
 
07:18:36.638 --> 07:18:37.990 align:start position:0%
it completely lacks any scientific
credibility

07:18:37.990 --> 07:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
credibility
 
07:18:40.388 --> 07:18:40.398 align:start position:0%
according to the human rights campaign
 
07:18:42.310 --> 07:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
there's no credible evidence that
 
07:18:44.310 --> 07:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy can change a person's
 
07:18:46.868 --> 07:18:46.878 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation
 
07:18:49.670 --> 07:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
or gender identity or expression
 
07:18:51.750 --> 07:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
to the contrary and this is still from
 
07:18:53.110 --> 07:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
the same quote
 
07:18:55.590 --> 07:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
research has clearly shown that these
 
07:18:57.990 --> 07:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
practices pose devastating health risks
 
07:19:00.628 --> 07:19:00.638 align:start position:0%
for lgbtq people
 
07:19:03.670 --> 07:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
such as depression decreased self-esteem
 
07:19:06.310 --> 07:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
substance abuse homelessness and even
 
07:19:08.310 --> 07:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
suicidal behavior which many people
 
07:19:11.030 --> 07:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
before me have brought up
 
07:19:13.510 --> 07:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
the harmful practice is condemned by
 
07:19:16.070 --> 07:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
every major medical and mental health
 
07:19:18.388 --> 07:19:18.398 align:start position:0%
organization including the american
 
07:19:20.468 --> 07:19:20.478 align:start position:0%
psychiatric association
 
07:19:22.948 --> 07:19:22.958 align:start position:0%
american psychological association and
 
07:19:25.750 --> 07:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
the american medical association so
 
07:19:27.830 --> 07:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
while you may disagree with one of them
 
07:19:29.590 --> 07:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
i would find it difficult that you agree
 
07:19:31.670 --> 07:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
with the entire
 
07:19:31.680 --> 07:19:33.590 align:start position:0%
with the entire
industry

07:19:33.590 --> 07:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
industry
 
07:19:35.830 --> 07:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
as you may know new hampshire is one of
 
07:19:38.150 --> 07:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
20 states that has banned conversion
 
07:19:41.350 --> 07:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
therapy for lgbtq minors
 
07:19:43.270 --> 07:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire did so
 
07:19:43.280 --> 07:19:45.350 align:start position:0%
new hampshire did so
legislatively

07:19:45.350 --> 07:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
legislatively
 
07:19:46.868 --> 07:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
and all the new england states have
 
07:19:49.350 --> 07:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
banned conversion therapy
 
07:19:50.788 --> 07:19:50.798 align:start position:0%
as well as all of the northeastern
 
07:19:52.788 --> 07:19:52.798 align:start position:0%
states except for pennsylvania
 
07:19:55.830 --> 07:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
so i think it would be a major and gross
 
07:19:57.510 --> 07:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
misstep to
 
07:20:00.468 --> 07:20:00.478 align:start position:0%
go against what is a clearly
 
07:20:02.628 --> 07:20:02.638 align:start position:0%
accepted understanding
 
07:20:04.948 --> 07:20:04.958 align:start position:0%
here today
 
07:20:04.958 --> 07:20:06.868 align:start position:0%
here today
um

07:20:06.868 --> 07:20:06.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:20:08.948 --> 07:20:08.958 align:start position:0%
and i since governor sununu signed the
 
07:20:11.510 --> 07:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
prohibition on conversion therapy i
 
07:20:13.750 --> 07:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
guess we wonder why sponsors of the bill
 
07:20:16.548 --> 07:20:16.558 align:start position:0%
um an abusive bill that is seek to roll
 
07:20:18.788 --> 07:20:18.798 align:start position:0%
back progress made for the lgbtq
 
07:20:20.788 --> 07:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
community under the same leadership that
 
07:20:23.430 --> 07:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
created it
 
07:20:25.830 --> 07:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
i'm now willing to answer any questions
 
07:20:28.310 --> 07:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
and speak on behalf
 
07:20:31.910 --> 07:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
of the lgbtq community as a member of it
 
07:20:33.910 --> 07:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
and not on behalf of lambda because i
 
07:20:35.510 --> 07:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to conflate those conflicts
 
07:20:36.628 --> 07:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
of interest
 
07:20:41.990 --> 07:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:43.910 --> 07:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
if there are any actually
 
07:20:46.830 --> 07:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
i'll ask a question as chair sure
 
07:20:49.510 --> 07:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
i listening to some of the prior
 
07:20:51.670 --> 07:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
testimony i heard that this is having a
 
07:20:55.430 --> 07:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on counseling is i'm
 
07:20:57.590 --> 07:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
curious about whether you believe that
 
07:20:59.830 --> 07:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
the all of these associations believing
 
07:21:02.388 --> 07:21:02.398 align:start position:0%
it's unethical already prohibits it
 
07:21:04.310 --> 07:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
through our existing statutes and
 
07:21:07.190 --> 07:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
licensing laws and if the harm of
 
07:21:10.548 --> 07:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
denying access to this to therapy in
 
07:21:12.628 --> 07:21:12.638 align:start position:0%
general to youth
 
07:21:13.830 --> 07:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
if that's a risk that we need to
 
07:21:15.670 --> 07:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
consider as well
 
07:21:18.788 --> 07:21:18.798 align:start position:0%
sure um by no means am i qualified or
 
07:21:21.750 --> 07:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'd have the expertise but i will say
 
07:21:23.830 --> 07:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
that um
 
07:21:26.628 --> 07:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
there they should not be conflated um
 
07:21:29.030 --> 07:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy with just um
 
07:21:32.388 --> 07:21:32.398 align:start position:0%
somebody's regular course of therapy
 
07:21:34.948 --> 07:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
as somebody who underwent
 
07:21:37.270 --> 07:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
not conversion therapy thankfully but as
 
07:21:39.670 --> 07:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
somebody in my adult life who has sought
 
07:21:43.110 --> 07:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
professional license uh
 
07:21:44.708 --> 07:21:44.718 align:start position:0%
psychite that means
 
07:21:47.030 --> 07:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
mental health services um
 
07:21:49.590 --> 07:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
those should be um taken into
 
07:21:51.910 --> 07:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
consideration but i think what's
 
07:21:51.920 --> 07:21:53.510 align:start position:0%
consideration but i think what's
fundamentally

07:21:53.510 --> 07:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
fundamentally
 
07:21:56.230 --> 07:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
important to notice too is the absence
 
07:21:58.868 --> 07:21:58.878 align:start position:0%
of inclusive lgbtq
 
07:22:00.548 --> 07:22:00.558 align:start position:0%
sex education in the state of new
 
07:22:00.558 --> 07:22:02.788 align:start position:0%
sex education in the state of new
hampshire

07:22:02.788 --> 07:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
07:22:04.708 --> 07:22:04.718 align:start position:0%
only nine states
 
07:22:07.190 --> 07:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
actually include lgbtq
 
07:22:10.230 --> 07:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum in sex education so i think
 
07:22:12.388 --> 07:22:12.398 align:start position:0%
that if we're going to try and offer
 
07:22:15.110 --> 07:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutic services to children we
 
07:22:17.030 --> 07:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
should start when they're young and in
 
07:22:19.388 --> 07:22:19.398 align:start position:0%
school and it shouldn't be from a
 
07:22:19.398 --> 07:22:21.350 align:start position:0%
school and it shouldn't be from a
heteronormative

07:22:21.350 --> 07:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
heteronormative
 
07:22:24.708 --> 07:22:24.718 align:start position:0%
perspective it should be inclusive
 
07:22:25.990 --> 07:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure if that fully answers
 
07:22:27.830 --> 07:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
your question but it does based on the
 
07:22:29.910 --> 07:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
best of my ability and lack of expertise
 
07:22:31.750 --> 07:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's all we can ever ask for so thank
 
07:22:32.868 --> 07:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
07:22:35.990 --> 07:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
sing oh sorry representative cushman
 
07:22:37.750 --> 07:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
07:22:40.150 --> 07:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you know of any
 
07:22:43.030 --> 07:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
therapists in new hampshire prior to the
 
07:22:45.590 --> 07:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
implementation of this law
 
07:22:48.868 --> 07:22:48.878 align:start position:0%
that we're performing the therapy that
 
07:22:51.750 --> 07:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
we're discussing here conversion therapy
 
07:22:55.670 --> 07:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
um to my knowledge i don't
 
07:22:57.110 --> 07:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
but i don't think that that obvious the
 
07:23:01.590 --> 07:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:08.150 --> 07:23:08.160 align:start position:0%

my experience and knowledge that i
 
07:23:58.150 --> 07:23:58.160 align:start position:0%

please look for my handout which i
 
07:24:07.750 --> 07:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
passed around it is the one with the
 
07:24:07.760 --> 07:24:10.388 align:start position:0%
passed around it is the one with the
green

07:24:10.388 --> 07:24:10.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:12.150 --> 07:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
paper clip
 
07:24:13.990 --> 07:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
you can read it the
 
07:24:14.000 --> 07:24:14.708 align:start position:0%
you can read it the
the

07:24:14.708 --> 07:24:14.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:24:17.270 --> 07:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
headings are informative you can
 
07:24:19.830 --> 07:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
probably catch the outline that way and
 
07:24:22.628 --> 07:24:22.638 align:start position:0%
also read deeper if you are looking at
 
07:24:24.388 --> 07:24:24.398 align:start position:0%
the details
 
07:24:26.548 --> 07:24:26.558 align:start position:0%
i'd like to call your attention
 
07:24:26.558 --> 07:24:27.750 align:start position:0%
i'd like to call your attention
to

07:24:27.750 --> 07:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:24:27.760 --> 07:24:28.708 align:start position:0%
to
page

07:24:28.708 --> 07:24:28.718 align:start position:0%
page
 
07:24:28.718 --> 07:24:30.070 align:start position:0%
page
two

07:24:30.070 --> 07:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
two
 
07:24:32.070 --> 07:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
where i'd like to go over the mechanics
 
07:24:35.110 --> 07:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
of the law that is going on in the books
 
07:24:37.910 --> 07:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
by the way as an aside i did stop seeing
 
07:24:39.670 --> 07:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
anyone under
 
07:24:43.510 --> 07:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
18 when this did happen uh when this was
 
07:24:43.520 --> 07:24:45.110 align:start position:0%
18 when this did happen uh when this was
enacted

07:24:45.110 --> 07:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
07:24:46.788 --> 07:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
and you'll see why
 
07:24:49.190 --> 07:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
if we look at the analysis of the
 
07:24:51.270 --> 07:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
wording of the law
 
07:24:52.868 --> 07:24:52.878 align:start position:0%
what i did was something in seventh
 
07:24:54.548 --> 07:24:54.558 align:start position:0%
grade they taught us how to diagram
 
07:24:54.558 --> 07:24:56.230 align:start position:0%
grade they taught us how to diagram
sentences

07:24:56.230 --> 07:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
sentences
 
07:24:58.388 --> 07:24:58.398 align:start position:0%
this is basically that
 
07:25:00.788 --> 07:25:00.798 align:start position:0%
i brought the same wording that there is
 
07:25:03.750 --> 07:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
in the statute and moved it into a
 
07:25:05.910 --> 07:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
format that we could analyze and see
 
07:25:07.430 --> 07:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
what's happening
 
07:25:09.670 --> 07:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
so what we have here is in the first
 
07:25:09.680 --> 07:25:10.708 align:start position:0%
so what we have here is in the first
section

07:25:10.708 --> 07:25:10.718 align:start position:0%
section
 
07:25:14.150 --> 07:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
in this chapter conversion therapy means
 
07:25:15.350 --> 07:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
and that means
 
07:25:17.830 --> 07:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
these therapies are prohibited
 
07:25:20.310 --> 07:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
practices or treatments that seek to
 
07:25:22.468 --> 07:25:22.478 align:start position:0%
change an individual's sexual
 
07:25:25.670 --> 07:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
orientation or gender identity
 
07:25:27.830 --> 07:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
including efforts to change
 
07:25:27.840 --> 07:25:29.030 align:start position:0%
including efforts to change
behaviors

07:25:29.030 --> 07:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
behaviors
 
07:25:31.750 --> 07:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
gender expressions or to eliminate or
 
07:25:34.788 --> 07:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
reduce sexual or romantic attractions or
 
07:25:37.190 --> 07:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
feelings toward individuals of the same
 
07:25:38.868 --> 07:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
chapter as gender
 
07:25:42.230 --> 07:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
now all of those things are prohibited
 
07:25:42.240 --> 07:25:43.110 align:start position:0%
now all of those things are prohibited
and

07:25:43.110 --> 07:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:25:46.310 --> 07:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that kind of talk goes on
 
07:25:47.990 --> 07:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
a lot with kids
 
07:25:49.590 --> 07:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
07:25:49.600 --> 07:25:50.708 align:start position:0%
whether or not
they're

07:25:50.708 --> 07:25:50.718 align:start position:0%
they're
 
07:25:53.510 --> 07:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
looking to change their gender identity
 
07:25:55.590 --> 07:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
they are developing their gender
 
07:25:55.600 --> 07:25:56.628 align:start position:0%
they are developing their gender
identity

07:25:56.628 --> 07:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
identity
 
07:25:58.948 --> 07:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
naturally and normally they will have a
 
07:26:03.270 --> 07:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
variety of considerations a variety of
 
07:26:07.110 --> 07:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
attractions of self um
 
07:26:10.310 --> 07:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
appreciation and and degradation there's
 
07:26:13.190 --> 07:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
a mixed bag being an adolescent and in
 
07:26:15.110 --> 07:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
this room we're all grown up we've
 
07:26:17.990 --> 07:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
passed by that and it lovely it seals
 
07:26:20.230 --> 07:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
over and we're not as aware of the
 
07:26:22.628 --> 07:26:22.638 align:start position:0%
torture that that uh
 
07:26:25.510 --> 07:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
age group goes through it's difficult
 
07:26:27.590 --> 07:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
and so we look and see these things are
 
07:26:30.468 --> 07:26:30.478 align:start position:0%
going to be talked about by any kid
 
07:26:32.708 --> 07:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
and the conversion therapy stories that
 
07:26:34.150 --> 07:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
we've heard of
 
07:26:34.160 --> 07:26:35.030 align:start position:0%
we've heard of
um

07:26:35.030 --> 07:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:26:37.110 --> 07:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
that over the several years that this
 
07:26:39.830 --> 07:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
bill has turned to law and and is now on
 
07:26:41.270 --> 07:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
the books
 
07:26:43.110 --> 07:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
these therapies are called conversion
 
07:26:45.910 --> 07:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
therapies the difficulty with them is
 
07:26:47.430 --> 07:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
that they are
 
07:26:51.830 --> 07:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
forcing an agenda on the kids and that's
 
07:26:54.070 --> 07:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
not at all um
 
07:26:56.628 --> 07:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
what any therapy is supposed to be ever
 
07:26:59.910 --> 07:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
anyway no matter what the topic is
 
07:27:01.670 --> 07:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
so then you have the rest of this
 
07:27:03.830 --> 07:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph conversion therapy shall not
 
07:27:03.840 --> 07:27:05.190 align:start position:0%
paragraph conversion therapy shall not
include

07:27:05.190 --> 07:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
include
 
07:27:07.510 --> 07:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
and that is these
 
07:27:10.868 --> 07:27:10.878 align:start position:0%
treatment exceptions are allowed
 
07:27:12.708 --> 07:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
counseling that provides assistance to a
 
07:27:16.070 --> 07:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
person undergoing gender transition
 
07:27:19.110 --> 07:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
or counseling to prevent or address
 
07:27:21.910 --> 07:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
unlawful conduct or unsafe sexual
 
07:27:21.920 --> 07:27:23.190 align:start position:0%
unlawful conduct or unsafe sexual
practices

07:27:23.190 --> 07:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
practices
 
07:27:25.270 --> 07:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
this might be kids who have been
 
07:27:27.750 --> 07:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
referred by the court having offended
 
07:27:30.310 --> 07:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
someone or perhaps dcyf
 
07:27:33.430 --> 07:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
has made a referral in that regard
 
07:27:35.030 --> 07:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
gender transition obviously we know what
 
07:27:37.270 --> 07:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
that is um
 
07:27:40.468 --> 07:27:40.478 align:start position:0%
those are the only two classes of minors
 
07:27:43.030 --> 07:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
who can basically freely address their
 
07:27:45.750 --> 07:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
issues but then we do come to the part
 
07:27:45.760 --> 07:27:47.750 align:start position:0%
issues but then we do come to the part
um

07:27:47.750 --> 07:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:27:50.150 --> 07:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
of what would it be like to do this such
 
07:27:50.160 --> 07:27:51.510 align:start position:0%
of what would it be like to do this such
counseling

07:27:51.510 --> 07:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
07:27:53.510 --> 07:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh that provides acceptance support
 
07:27:55.910 --> 07:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of a person that's good
 
07:27:58.070 --> 07:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
facilitates a person's coping social
 
07:28:00.388 --> 07:28:00.398 align:start position:0%
support and identity exploration and
 
07:28:03.430 --> 07:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
development good that's what we do
 
07:28:05.990 --> 07:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
including sexual orientation neutral
 
07:28:06.000 --> 07:28:07.830 align:start position:0%
including sexual orientation neutral
interventions

07:28:07.830 --> 07:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
interventions
 
07:28:09.990 --> 07:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
which as dr jamison pointed out we don't
 
07:28:11.510 --> 07:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
quite know what that is but i think we
 
07:28:13.910 --> 07:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
could basically say let's try not offend
 
07:28:16.150 --> 07:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
anyone would be your operating
 
07:28:16.160 --> 07:28:17.830 align:start position:0%
anyone would be your operating
definition

07:28:17.830 --> 07:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
definition
 
07:28:19.590 --> 07:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
and the last one is as long as such
 
07:28:22.388 --> 07:28:22.398 align:start position:0%
counseling does not seek to change an
 
07:28:24.230 --> 07:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
individual's sexual orientation or
 
07:28:26.310 --> 07:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
gender identity
 
07:28:28.830 --> 07:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
well here we have this seek to change
 
07:28:31.990 --> 07:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
problem uh which i go into talking about
 
07:28:34.708 --> 07:28:34.718 align:start position:0%
in the next section is that you cannot
 
07:28:37.590 --> 07:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
really define intent
 
07:28:40.310 --> 07:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
and make that the offense
 
07:28:42.230 --> 07:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
intent how do you how do you find out
 
07:28:45.350 --> 07:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
what someone's intent is is you infer it
 
07:28:47.270 --> 07:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
from a whole bunch of things that they
 
07:28:47.280 --> 07:28:48.070 align:start position:0%
from a whole bunch of things that they
do

07:28:48.070 --> 07:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
do
 
07:28:50.310 --> 07:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
and to know what happens in therapy i
 
07:28:51.910 --> 07:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
think you probably can imagine you've
 
07:28:54.868 --> 07:28:54.878 align:start position:0%
seen bob newhart
 
07:28:57.190 --> 07:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
when you're in therapy you talk about
 
07:28:59.270 --> 07:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
things and the therapist gives you
 
07:29:02.150 --> 07:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
reflections back oh i i can't stand how
 
07:29:03.750 --> 07:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
it is at home it sounds like you're
 
07:29:05.910 --> 07:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
having difficulties at home you know
 
07:29:08.548 --> 07:29:08.558 align:start position:0%
it's it's all re-characterizing and and
 
07:29:10.708 --> 07:29:10.718 align:start position:0%
and giving the
 
07:29:10.718 --> 07:29:11.430 align:start position:0%
and giving the
the

07:29:11.430 --> 07:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:29:13.830 --> 07:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
the minor or the adult the opportunity
 
07:29:16.628 --> 07:29:16.638 align:start position:0%
to hear their words back at them so they
 
07:29:19.030 --> 07:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
can reflect at them now what if the
 
07:29:22.230 --> 07:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
child says i can't stand my lesbian
 
07:29:24.948 --> 07:29:24.958 align:start position:0%
feelings or i really am
 
07:29:27.030 --> 07:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
disgusted by some whatever they might
 
07:29:29.910 --> 07:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
say if the therapist according to this
 
07:29:29.920 --> 07:29:30.948 align:start position:0%
say if the therapist according to this
law

07:29:30.948 --> 07:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
law
 
07:29:32.548 --> 07:29:32.558 align:start position:0%
says it sounds like you're not
 
07:29:35.430 --> 07:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable with those feelings toward
 
07:29:38.388 --> 07:29:38.398 align:start position:0%
the same sex you're breaking the law
 
07:29:40.628 --> 07:29:40.638 align:start position:0%
you cannot reflect on that portion of
 
07:29:42.708 --> 07:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
07:29:42.718 --> 07:29:44.230 align:start position:0%
the uh
students

07:29:44.230 --> 07:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
students
 
07:29:45.510 --> 07:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
the youth's
 
07:29:49.350 --> 07:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
feelings they need to be able to express
 
07:29:51.910 --> 07:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
all of their feelings they need all of
 
07:29:54.948 --> 07:29:54.958 align:start position:0%
those aspects to be elaborated on and
 
07:29:54.958 --> 07:29:55.670 align:start position:0%
those aspects to be elaborated on and
and

07:29:55.670 --> 07:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:29:57.030 --> 07:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
looked at and
 
07:30:00.788 --> 07:30:00.798 align:start position:0%
evaluated themselves it is against the
 
07:30:04.388 --> 07:30:04.398 align:start position:0%
the um ethics of codes of all of these
 
07:30:06.868 --> 07:30:06.878 align:start position:0%
professions to push your own agenda on
 
07:30:10.468 --> 07:30:10.478 align:start position:0%
the kids of any age adults either it's
 
07:30:12.548 --> 07:30:12.558 align:start position:0%
not allowed
 
07:30:14.868 --> 07:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
but let's see we'll go to page three and
 
07:30:16.468 --> 07:30:16.478 align:start position:0%
you can see in the beginning at the
 
07:30:19.670 --> 07:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
middle of the page there's a little grid
 
07:30:22.468 --> 07:30:22.478 align:start position:0%
but therapy conversion is limited
 
07:30:26.628 --> 07:30:26.638 align:start position:0%
conversation is limited due to rsa 332l
 
07:30:28.708 --> 07:30:28.718 align:start position:0%
and you can see in this the way it's
 
07:30:30.628 --> 07:30:30.638 align:start position:0%
been defined
 
07:30:32.948 --> 07:30:32.958 align:start position:0%
same-sex attraction cross-gender
 
07:30:35.350 --> 07:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
attraction and then at the top there's
 
07:30:37.750 --> 07:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
two columns positive aspects negative
 
07:30:40.948 --> 07:30:40.958 align:start position:0%
aspects well according to this law
 
07:30:43.430 --> 07:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
when you're talking with youth
 
07:30:44.868 --> 07:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
they can talk
 
07:30:48.150 --> 07:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
positively about same-sex attraction
 
07:30:51.990 --> 07:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
and you can too and they can talk
 
07:30:54.548 --> 07:30:54.558 align:start position:0%
positively about cross-gender attraction
 
07:30:57.190 --> 07:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
and so can you as the therapist
 
07:30:58.708 --> 07:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
but when you get over to the negative
 
07:31:01.590 --> 07:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
aspects and goodness knows in therapy
 
07:31:03.910 --> 07:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of negatives and teenagers
 
07:31:06.788 --> 07:31:06.798 align:start position:0%
are very good at bringing them out
 
07:31:09.830 --> 07:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
if they say anything about same-sex
 
07:31:11.990 --> 07:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
attraction that's negative
 
07:31:14.708 --> 07:31:14.718 align:start position:0%
the therapist by this law is prohibited
 
07:31:17.190 --> 07:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
from saying anything about it
 
07:31:19.510 --> 07:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
and you can't help them
 
07:31:19.520 --> 07:31:20.388 align:start position:0%
and you can't help them
with

07:31:20.388 --> 07:31:20.398 align:start position:0%
with
 
07:31:23.430 --> 07:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
their torment about this or that portion
 
07:31:24.628 --> 07:31:24.638 align:start position:0%
of their
 
07:31:26.310 --> 07:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh conflicts
 
07:31:28.468 --> 07:31:28.478 align:start position:0%
you could talk about
 
07:31:30.070 --> 07:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
negative aspects of cross-gender
 
07:31:30.080 --> 07:31:31.590 align:start position:0%
negative aspects of cross-gender
attraction

07:31:31.590 --> 07:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
attraction
 
07:31:34.150 --> 07:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
but not the same gender attraction
 
07:31:37.030 --> 07:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
unless you can have a free an open
 
07:31:40.948 --> 07:31:40.958 align:start position:0%
discussion in pursuit of their truth
 
07:31:43.350 --> 07:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
they won't get anywhere and you'll just
 
07:31:45.430 --> 07:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
get in trouble
 
07:31:47.590 --> 07:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
having served on several boards i do
 
07:31:49.990 --> 07:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
know how it goes and what what would
 
07:31:55.190 --> 07:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:57.910 --> 07:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
four in the middle how the current reg
 
07:32:00.628 --> 07:32:00.638 align:start position:0%
law in practice would be handled in the
 
07:32:03.110 --> 07:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
regulatory system this is my opinion
 
07:32:05.430 --> 07:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
from having served on these boards
 
07:32:08.548 --> 07:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
as written it provides very narrow gates
 
07:32:12.070 --> 07:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
for discussing sexual issues in therapy
 
07:32:14.548 --> 07:32:14.558 align:start position:0%
boards have no choice but to find guilty
 
07:32:16.628 --> 07:32:16.638 align:start position:0%
those who walk into the confusion of
 
07:32:20.628 --> 07:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
this minefield because it's law
 
07:32:22.548 --> 07:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
if it were repealed and the practices
 
07:32:25.910 --> 07:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
revert to using professional standards
 
07:32:29.110 --> 07:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
which would outlaw coercion and
 
07:32:32.230 --> 07:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
nasty stuff that we've heard about
 
07:32:34.070 --> 07:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
if it were repealed
 
07:32:35.990 --> 07:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
the boards could weigh the circumstances
 
07:32:37.030 --> 07:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
and make
 
07:32:39.110 --> 07:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
sure that the doctors honor the
 
07:32:39.120 --> 07:32:41.190 align:start position:0%
sure that the doctors honor the
self-determination

07:32:41.190 --> 07:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
self-determination
 
07:32:43.590 --> 07:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
of the children in their care
 
07:32:45.190 --> 07:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
that's what we're there for i have
 
07:32:47.990 --> 07:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
included in the last several pages uh in
 
07:32:51.510 --> 07:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
the appendix of my testimony
 
07:32:53.670 --> 07:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh quotes from the standards of care
 
07:32:55.590 --> 07:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
these are the portions that the each of
 
07:32:57.430 --> 07:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
these boards would use
 
07:32:58.708 --> 07:32:58.718 align:start position:0%
to measure
 
07:33:01.270 --> 07:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
the the complaint that would come before
 
07:33:03.350 --> 07:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
them if somebody felt that their
 
07:33:03.360 --> 07:33:04.548 align:start position:0%
them if somebody felt that their
therapist

07:33:04.548 --> 07:33:04.558 align:start position:0%
therapist
 
07:33:06.628 --> 07:33:06.638 align:start position:0%
was being pushy
 
07:33:06.638 --> 07:33:08.830 align:start position:0%
was being pushy
argumentative

07:33:08.830 --> 07:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
argumentative
 
07:33:11.510 --> 07:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
judgmental um
 
07:33:11.520 --> 07:33:13.670 align:start position:0%
judgmental um
coercive

07:33:13.670 --> 07:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
coercive
 
07:33:13.680 --> 07:33:15.990 align:start position:0%
coercive
punitive

07:33:15.990 --> 07:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
punitive
 
07:33:18.708 --> 07:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
all that stuff unaffirming
 
07:33:19.990 --> 07:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
all of those things
 
07:33:21.750 --> 07:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
this is these are the measures they
 
07:33:24.468 --> 07:33:24.478 align:start position:0%
would use and having seen many cases of
 
07:33:26.388 --> 07:33:26.398 align:start position:0%
all sorts go through i think the boards
 
07:33:29.590 --> 07:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
do a pretty good job of this action and
 
07:33:31.910 --> 07:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
this analysis and applying these things
 
07:33:33.030 --> 07:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
and you can look through and see the
 
07:33:35.270 --> 07:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
different wording the different uh
 
07:33:37.590 --> 07:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
professions have it differently there's
 
07:33:41.910 --> 07:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
about five professions listed there
 
07:33:44.868 --> 07:33:44.878 align:start position:0%
i do want to say also
 
07:33:48.468 --> 07:33:48.478 align:start position:0%
that it is a dangerous statute being so
 
07:33:48.478 --> 07:33:49.590 align:start position:0%
that it is a dangerous statute being so
vague

07:33:49.590 --> 07:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
vague
 
07:33:49.600 --> 07:33:51.110 align:start position:0%
vague
and

07:33:51.110 --> 07:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:33:53.830 --> 07:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that it went through that way
 
07:33:57.350 --> 07:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
i i was verbal at the onset of this but
 
07:33:57.360 --> 07:33:59.110 align:start position:0%
i i was verbal at the onset of this but
um

07:33:59.110 --> 07:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:34:00.628 --> 07:34:00.638 align:start position:0%
it wasn't as bad as it could have been
 
07:34:02.230 --> 07:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
they were going to make a misdemeanor
 
07:34:04.070 --> 07:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
out of it long ago and at least that's
 
07:34:06.548 --> 07:34:06.558 align:start position:0%
not in there so that's good
 
07:34:09.190 --> 07:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
but this needs to be in the hand of the
 
07:34:12.070 --> 07:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
professionals who do this good judgment
 
07:34:13.590 --> 07:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
in their work
 
07:34:15.350 --> 07:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
in regulating the licenses in new
 
07:34:15.360 --> 07:34:16.628 align:start position:0%
in regulating the licenses in new
hampshire

07:34:16.628 --> 07:34:16.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
07:34:20.310 --> 07:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
if apa wants to change their coding
 
07:34:22.868 --> 07:34:22.878 align:start position:0%
their ethics codes to reflect certain
 
07:34:25.590 --> 07:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
things stronger in this they can
 
07:34:27.430 --> 07:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
i think that these cover it very
 
07:34:30.468 --> 07:34:30.478 align:start position:0%
adequately i would never have done any
 
07:34:32.628 --> 07:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
of the things in conversion therapy as
 
07:34:34.948 --> 07:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
described at all
 
07:34:36.628 --> 07:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
and i've certainly talked with a lot of
 
07:34:38.628 --> 07:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
people of all ages about their gender
 
07:34:40.868 --> 07:34:40.878 align:start position:0%
issues their development issues it's a
 
07:34:42.628 --> 07:34:42.638 align:start position:0%
very fluid process
 
07:34:44.388 --> 07:34:44.398 align:start position:0%
and dr warner we're going to have to
 
07:34:46.150 --> 07:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
wrap it up because we've got a number of
 
07:34:48.628 --> 07:34:48.638 align:start position:0%
people will you take some questions
 
07:34:48.638 --> 07:34:49.510 align:start position:0%
people will you take some questions

receiving consequences for having
 
07:35:23.510 --> 07:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
conversations with

07:35:42.830 --> 07:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
it goes out
 
07:35:45.750 --> 07:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
huh okay i will only be able to speak
 
07:35:47.430 --> 07:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
about the things that have come into the
 
07:35:49.708 --> 07:35:49.718 align:start position:0%
public domain i can't reveal
 
07:35:51.590 --> 07:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
confidentiality things
 
07:35:54.310 --> 07:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
but there are no cases that i'm aware of
 
07:35:55.910 --> 07:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the public
 
07:35:55.920 --> 07:35:56.948 align:start position:0%
in the public
arena

07:35:56.948 --> 07:35:56.958 align:start position:0%
arena
 
07:35:58.708 --> 07:35:58.718 align:start position:0%
that involved this
 
07:35:58.718 --> 07:35:59.750 align:start position:0%
that involved this
okay

07:35:59.750 --> 07:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:36:01.910 --> 07:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
 
07:36:01.920 --> 07:36:03.270 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
so

07:36:03.270 --> 07:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:36:06.310 --> 07:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:08.948 --> 07:36:08.958 align:start position:0%
while my reading of
 
07:36:11.270 --> 07:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
convert what conversion therapy is not
 
07:36:13.510 --> 07:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
or what is allowed is not the same as
 
07:36:15.750 --> 07:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
what your reading is of it
 
07:36:18.548 --> 07:36:18.558 align:start position:0%
i do agree that it's not written very
 
07:36:18.558 --> 07:36:20.388 align:start position:0%
i do agree that it's not written very
artfully

07:36:20.388 --> 07:36:20.398 align:start position:0%
artfully
 
07:36:20.398 --> 07:36:23.910 align:start position:0%
artfully
and

07:36:23.910 --> 07:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:25.030 --> 07:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
if the
 
07:36:27.110 --> 07:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
if the ban on conversion therapy
 
07:36:29.990 --> 07:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
remained in statute as is
 
07:36:33.990 --> 07:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:36.230 --> 07:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
the wording in the previous
 
07:36:38.310 --> 07:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
under the definition
 
07:36:40.388 --> 07:36:40.398 align:start position:0%
if all the information was just taken
 
07:36:42.388 --> 07:36:42.398 align:start position:0%
out about what
 
07:36:44.788 --> 07:36:44.798 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy is not
 
07:36:47.350 --> 07:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
or what is allowed
 
07:36:49.510 --> 07:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't what is allowed revert to
 
07:36:49.520 --> 07:36:50.708 align:start position:0%
wouldn't what is allowed revert to
people's

07:36:50.708 --> 07:36:50.718 align:start position:0%
people's
 
07:36:55.910 --> 07:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:58.548 --> 07:36:58.558 align:start position:0%
if we took out the definition of what
 
07:37:01.590 --> 07:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy is not
 
07:37:03.670 --> 07:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
but left in the ban on conversion
 
07:37:06.948 --> 07:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
therapy or coercive therapy
 
07:37:08.948 --> 07:37:08.958 align:start position:0%
would that be a solution to the problem
 
07:37:10.788 --> 07:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
that you seem to you said you stopped
 
07:37:13.110 --> 07:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
seeing adolescence
 
07:37:15.110 --> 07:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
i i think that if you have a law that
 
07:37:17.350 --> 07:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
says you you you're targeting something
 
07:37:19.750 --> 07:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
and you don't define it this was their
 
07:37:19.760 --> 07:37:20.868 align:start position:0%
and you don't define it this was their
attempt

07:37:20.868 --> 07:37:20.878 align:start position:0%
attempt
 
07:37:22.948 --> 07:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
to to define it
 
07:37:25.430 --> 07:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
and if it doesn't get defined
 
07:37:28.948 --> 07:37:28.958 align:start position:0%
then it's a mess also i i think that the
 
07:37:30.548 --> 07:37:30.558 align:start position:0%
point is is that
 
07:37:32.708 --> 07:37:32.718 align:start position:0%
all of these codes will cover all of the
 
07:37:35.270 --> 07:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
problems of conversion therapy that
 
07:37:37.910 --> 07:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
people have imagined
 
07:37:40.788 --> 07:37:40.798 align:start position:0%
and and were afraid of
 
07:37:40.798 --> 07:37:41.830 align:start position:0%
and and were afraid of
and

07:37:41.830 --> 07:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:37:44.310 --> 07:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
we do have a lot of information that
 
07:37:46.150 --> 07:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
there it was not going on in new
 
07:37:48.310 --> 07:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire at the time of this
 
07:37:49.910 --> 07:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
legislation we're going to be moving
 
07:37:52.230 --> 07:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
along quickly dr shapiro representative
 
07:37:54.468 --> 07:37:54.478 align:start position:0%
shapiro follow up i'll just make one
 
07:37:58.150 --> 07:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
more attempt um if if we
 
07:38:01.270 --> 07:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
change the definition so that it defined
 
07:38:04.230 --> 07:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy or coercive therapy
 
07:38:08.070 --> 07:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
but didn't define the alternative
 
07:38:09.750 --> 07:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
would that
 
07:38:12.070 --> 07:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
have made you feel safer as a therapist
 
07:38:13.750 --> 07:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
working with adolescents
 
07:38:16.070 --> 07:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
i would have to see the wording for that
 
07:38:18.388 --> 07:38:18.398 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
07:38:18.398 --> 07:38:22.150 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
weber

07:38:22.150 --> 07:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:25.830 --> 07:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so as a follow-up to that
 
07:38:28.868 --> 07:38:28.878 align:start position:0%
if we left the first sentence
 
07:38:31.510 --> 07:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
which you said was all right
 
07:38:33.510 --> 07:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
which said the conversion therapy means
 
07:38:35.350 --> 07:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
practices or treatment that seeks to
 
07:38:36.948 --> 07:38:36.958 align:start position:0%
change an individual's sexual
 
07:38:38.628 --> 07:38:38.638 align:start position:0%
orientation or gender
 
07:38:40.628 --> 07:38:40.638 align:start position:0%
identity including efforts to change
 
07:38:43.270 --> 07:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
behaviors or general or expressions or
 
07:38:45.510 --> 07:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic
 
07:38:47.110 --> 07:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
attractions or feeling towards
 
07:38:49.350 --> 07:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
individuals of the same gender
 
07:38:51.110 --> 07:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
if we left that
 
07:38:54.708 --> 07:38:54.718 align:start position:0%
and then we simply included
 
07:38:56.468 --> 07:38:56.478 align:start position:0%
in place of the language that you're
 
07:38:58.868 --> 07:38:58.878 align:start position:0%
finding troublesome
 
07:39:00.948 --> 07:39:00.958 align:start position:0%
the words
 
07:39:03.750 --> 07:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
conversion share therapy shall not
 
07:39:07.190 --> 07:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
include counseling that honors the self
 
07:39:10.548 --> 07:39:10.558 align:start position:0%
determination of minors in their care
 
07:39:12.548 --> 07:39:12.558 align:start position:0%
would that not solve the problem
 
07:39:14.070 --> 07:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
that could help a little bit but we do
 
07:39:16.548 --> 07:39:16.558 align:start position:0%
have the problem in the first paragraph
 
07:39:19.590 --> 07:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
where it says seeks to change which is
 
07:39:23.750 --> 07:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
very vague um one could say that if
 
07:39:27.110 --> 07:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
if a child says i don't like these these
 
07:39:27.120 --> 07:39:28.628 align:start position:0%
if a child says i don't like these these
feelings

07:39:28.628 --> 07:39:28.638 align:start position:0%
feelings
 
07:39:30.310 --> 07:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
and and the therapist says it sounds
 
07:39:32.468 --> 07:39:32.478 align:start position:0%
like you don't like these feelings right
 
07:39:34.788 --> 07:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
now they've just done it
 
07:39:34.798 --> 07:39:35.670 align:start position:0%
now they've just done it
i

07:39:35.670 --> 07:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
07:39:39.750 --> 07:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
well follow up follow up um
 
07:39:41.750 --> 07:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
whether i not agree with your parsing of
 
07:39:43.190 --> 07:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
the words
 
07:39:47.670 --> 07:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:52.788 --> 07:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
be helpful if we made it clearer
 
07:39:57.030 --> 07:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
that it is the therapist who should not
 
07:39:59.990 --> 07:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
seek to change that the therapist should
 
07:40:00.000 --> 07:40:01.510 align:start position:0%
seek to change that the therapist should
follow

07:40:01.510 --> 07:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
follow
 
07:40:03.590 --> 07:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
the questioning
 
07:40:03.600 --> 07:40:04.708 align:start position:0%
the questioning
or

07:40:04.708 --> 07:40:04.718 align:start position:0%
or
 
07:40:07.670 --> 07:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
the feelings or the concerns of the
 
07:40:10.548 --> 07:40:10.558 align:start position:0%
individual being counseled that sounds
 
07:40:13.350 --> 07:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
like an improvement i'd be very happy to
 
07:40:18.388 --> 07:40:18.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:20.230 --> 07:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
representative kenner
 
07:40:21.910 --> 07:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
yes actually i want to pick up it was a
 
07:40:23.990 --> 07:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
good timing because in the comments you
 
07:40:26.310 --> 07:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
just repeated i'm still confused because
 
07:40:28.468 --> 07:40:28.478 align:start position:0%
you talk about intent and you have used
 
07:40:31.030 --> 07:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
now twice that example of a person says
 
07:40:32.868 --> 07:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
i'm just troubled by my
 
07:40:35.590 --> 07:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
feelings uh my i think used my lesbian
 
07:40:38.230 --> 07:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
feelings and you said if you reflected
 
07:40:39.990 --> 07:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
well sounds like you're troubled
 
07:40:41.830 --> 07:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you agree that the intent of
 
07:40:45.270 --> 07:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
that statement is not to change a person
 
07:40:46.948 --> 07:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
but to actually ask them to be more
 
07:40:48.708 --> 07:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
introspective and continue talking
 
07:40:50.150 --> 07:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
you're trying to encourage them to
 
07:40:52.230 --> 07:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
continue to talk whereas wouldn't that
 
07:40:53.590 --> 07:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
be very different than if you said well
 
07:40:55.350 --> 07:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right it's horrible
 
07:40:57.270 --> 07:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
and disgusting that would be attempting
 
07:40:58.788 --> 07:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
to change the other is attempting them
 
07:41:01.350 --> 07:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
to continue to talk so i'm not quite
 
07:41:03.430 --> 07:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
sure how that example says you violated
 
07:41:05.510 --> 07:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
the law when you said it sounds like
 
07:41:07.350 --> 07:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
you're troubled can you clarify that for
 
07:41:09.750 --> 07:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
me yes i can um
 
07:41:11.910 --> 07:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
what the problem is is
 
07:41:13.910 --> 07:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
we're looking at this through a legal
 
07:41:16.788 --> 07:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
point of view and and with
 
07:41:18.468 --> 07:41:18.478 align:start position:0%
it's not your problem you know it's
 
07:41:20.468 --> 07:41:20.478 align:start position:0%
you're not the one in therapy
 
07:41:22.708 --> 07:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
but a child in therapy is going to
 
07:41:23.990 --> 07:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
remember and
 
07:41:26.788 --> 07:41:26.798 align:start position:0%
reiterate the their conversations
 
07:41:29.350 --> 07:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
over and over again with various people
 
07:41:30.628 --> 07:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
in their life
 
07:41:32.868 --> 07:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
and we don't know what they're going to
 
07:41:34.468 --> 07:41:34.478 align:start position:0%
make of it when you say it sounds like
 
07:41:36.388 --> 07:41:36.398 align:start position:0%
you're troubled by those lesbian
 
07:41:36.398 --> 07:41:37.430 align:start position:0%
you're troubled by those lesbian
feelings

07:41:37.430 --> 07:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
feelings
 
07:41:40.230 --> 07:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
um that they then go on to their next
 
07:41:42.310 --> 07:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
person they say my therapist says i'm
 
07:41:42.320 --> 07:41:43.750 align:start position:0%
person they say my therapist says i'm
troubled

07:41:43.750 --> 07:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
troubled
 
07:41:46.070 --> 07:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
and and that my lesbian feelings are are
 
07:41:46.080 --> 07:41:47.030 align:start position:0%
and and that my lesbian feelings are are
trouble

07:41:47.030 --> 07:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
07:41:50.150 --> 07:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
and you know the the game of telephone
 
07:41:51.830 --> 07:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
where you you're
 
07:41:53.830 --> 07:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to come back because it's not
 
07:41:57.110 --> 07:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
very specific and it does not allow
 
07:41:59.990 --> 07:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh therapists to fully explore and if
 
07:42:02.708 --> 07:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
you happen to say these things that are
 
07:42:06.388 --> 07:42:06.398 align:start position:0%
reflections of negatives for the kids
 
07:42:08.948 --> 07:42:08.958 align:start position:0%
i i think it's a very dangerous area
 
07:42:11.190 --> 07:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
it gets repeated it'll get into a
 
07:42:13.030 --> 07:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
complaint and then the boy is going to
 
07:42:14.548 --> 07:42:14.558 align:start position:0%
say well we don't know we weren't there
 
07:42:17.270 --> 07:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
we don't know what said
 
07:42:19.510 --> 07:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
what's known is
 
07:42:19.520 --> 07:42:20.310 align:start position:0%
what's known is
the

07:42:20.310 --> 07:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:42:23.190 --> 07:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
professions have a non-coercion
 
07:42:24.868 --> 07:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
angle already
 
07:42:27.670 --> 07:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
in the codes in the ethical codes you're
 
07:42:31.030 --> 07:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
not just to coerce your patients ever
 
07:42:33.190 --> 07:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
and that's an important thing to
 
07:42:35.190 --> 07:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
remember is that the boards do know how
 
07:42:37.830 --> 07:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
to enforce that
 
07:42:40.708 --> 07:42:40.718 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
07:42:42.230 --> 07:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
07:42:44.070 --> 07:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you donald trump for taking my
 
07:42:44.080 --> 07:42:45.030 align:start position:0%
and thank you donald trump for taking my
question

07:42:45.030 --> 07:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:42:46.708 --> 07:42:46.718 align:start position:0%
i'm reading through your testimony and
 
07:42:48.548 --> 07:42:48.558 align:start position:0%
what basically comes down to when i'm
 
07:42:48.558 --> 07:42:49.430 align:start position:0%
what basically comes down to when i'm
hearing

07:42:49.430 --> 07:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
07:42:52.150 --> 07:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
through your testimony as well
 
07:42:53.110 --> 07:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
is the
 
07:42:55.670 --> 07:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
concern is around this statute no way
 
07:42:57.830 --> 07:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
the statute is written
 
07:42:58.868 --> 07:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
where are you
 
07:43:02.548 --> 07:43:02.558 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at your very first paragraph
 
07:43:05.830 --> 07:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
on line one i saw page one okay
 
07:43:07.430 --> 07:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
because of the faulty design and wording
 
07:43:09.110 --> 07:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
of the statute that seems to be the
 
07:43:10.788 --> 07:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
underlying concern
 
07:43:12.948 --> 07:43:12.958 align:start position:0%
that i'm hearing through your testimony
 
07:43:14.548 --> 07:43:14.558 align:start position:0%
most of today
 
07:43:16.788 --> 07:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to do not to parse it
 
07:43:18.868 --> 07:43:18.878 align:start position:0%
but i think i'm trying to understand is
 
07:43:20.788 --> 07:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
the word seek is ambiguous which is what
 
07:43:22.548 --> 07:43:22.558 align:start position:0%
you pointed out
 
07:43:22.558 --> 07:43:23.910 align:start position:0%
you pointed out
and

07:43:23.910 --> 07:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:43:25.670 --> 07:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to avoid or i think
 
07:43:27.030 --> 07:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
you're trying to avoid we're all trying
 
07:43:29.750 --> 07:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
to avoid is that someone's directing the
 
07:43:31.430 --> 07:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
child to do something against the
 
07:43:33.990 --> 07:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
child's wishes or against the child
 
07:43:35.510 --> 07:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
and trying to find a way to understand
 
07:43:37.110 --> 07:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
this because if the therapist is
 
07:43:38.830 --> 07:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
directing the
 
07:43:38.840 --> 07:43:40.548 align:start position:0%
directing the
child

07:43:40.548 --> 07:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
child
 
07:43:42.388 --> 07:43:42.398 align:start position:0%
um that seems to be
 
07:43:44.070 --> 07:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
cohesion so therefore
 
07:43:45.910 --> 07:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
how do we come up with this if we found
 
07:43:48.628 --> 07:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
a way in a statute to address this
 
07:43:50.468 --> 07:43:50.478 align:start position:0%
and the wording and so forth would we
 
07:43:51.830 --> 07:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
have to repeal the statute that's what
 
07:43:53.030 --> 07:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to get to
 
07:43:54.788 --> 07:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
yes i think it needs to be repealed
 
07:43:56.628 --> 07:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
because these things are already in
 
07:43:58.868 --> 07:43:58.878 align:start position:0%
those ethics codes that you can see at
 
07:44:00.868 --> 07:44:00.878 align:start position:0%
the end of my testimony
 
07:44:02.468 --> 07:44:02.478 align:start position:0%
they all say
 
07:44:04.270 --> 07:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
that you are to respect the
 
07:44:08.150 --> 07:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
self-determination of your client
 
07:44:10.070 --> 07:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
thanks very much thank you so much i
 
07:44:13.750 --> 07:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:13.760 --> 07:44:19.990 align:start position:0%
 
next

07:44:19.990 --> 07:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:21.510 --> 07:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
hi my name is dave mcpherson i'm from
 
07:44:23.750 --> 07:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
hooksett i'm here to support my son
 
07:44:25.590 --> 07:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
andrew over here in the corner um i'm
 
07:44:27.590 --> 07:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
against this bill i'm gonna try to keep
 
07:44:29.990 --> 07:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
a kind of simple uh representative
 
07:44:31.750 --> 07:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
said that it was a simple bill so the
 
07:44:33.270 --> 07:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
way i look at this we're a society that
 
07:44:35.430 --> 07:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
wants to move forward we're here to
 
07:44:37.190 --> 07:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
provide as much support as we can for
 
07:44:38.708 --> 07:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
our children and our families that are
 
07:44:40.310 --> 07:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
going through this
 
07:44:43.190 --> 07:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
decision this uh
 
07:44:45.270 --> 07:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
whatever word you want to use um we want
 
07:44:46.948 --> 07:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
to move forward
 
07:44:48.628 --> 07:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
i feel like repealing this bill is going
 
07:44:50.468 --> 07:44:50.478 align:start position:0%
to take a step backwards in their
 
07:44:53.350 --> 07:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
support that these children need
 
07:44:54.708 --> 07:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
representative testerman mentioned he
 
07:44:56.230 --> 07:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
was a pilot i use this analogy in a
 
07:44:57.190 --> 07:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
different scenario i'm going to use it
 
07:44:59.350 --> 07:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
today to kind of give you help you
 
07:45:01.830 --> 07:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
in 1903 the wright brothers flew 120
 
07:45:01.840 --> 07:45:03.030 align:start position:0%
in 1903 the wright brothers flew 120
feet

07:45:03.030 --> 07:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
feet
 
07:45:05.910 --> 07:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
63 years later we walked on the moon
 
07:45:07.990 --> 07:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's technology that's advancement
 
07:45:10.150 --> 07:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
that's moving forward if we think of
 
07:45:12.548 --> 07:45:12.558 align:start position:0%
where the lgbt community was 63 years
 
07:45:14.708 --> 07:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
ago and where we are today we are
 
07:45:16.628 --> 07:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
literally walking on the moon in the
 
07:45:20.070 --> 07:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
lgbtq community today
 
07:45:21.110 --> 07:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
we've put
 
07:45:23.910 --> 07:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
citizens in space in the last two years
 
07:45:26.468 --> 07:45:26.478 align:start position:0%
we are talking about flying and manned
 
07:45:28.628 --> 07:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
missions to mars that's technology
 
07:45:30.948 --> 07:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
that's moving forward where will we be
 
07:45:34.388 --> 07:45:34.398 align:start position:0%
in another 50 years in the lgbtq btq
 
07:45:34.398 --> 07:45:35.670 align:start position:0%
in another 50 years in the lgbtq btq
community

07:45:35.670 --> 07:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
community
 
07:45:37.190 --> 07:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
we need to repeal this so that we have
 
07:45:38.948 --> 07:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
the ability to continue to move forward
 
07:45:41.110 --> 07:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
in that progression
 
07:45:44.468 --> 07:45:44.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:46.468 --> 07:45:46.478 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
07:45:48.628 --> 07:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
next let's see i don't know if i see him
 
07:45:49.990 --> 07:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
next uh the chair will call
 
07:45:52.310 --> 07:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative kurt wilper or is he out
 
07:45:53.670 --> 07:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
in the hall
 
07:45:53.680 --> 07:45:54.548 align:start position:0%
in the hall
okay

07:45:54.548 --> 07:45:54.558 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:46:00.548 --> 07:46:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:00.558 --> 07:46:26.830 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

07:46:26.830 --> 07:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:29.110 --> 07:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
okay if you don't mind i'll take this
 
07:46:30.468 --> 07:46:30.478 align:start position:0%
off so you can hear me hopefully a
 
07:46:32.310 --> 07:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
little bit clearer
 
07:46:33.910 --> 07:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everybody thank you for
 
07:46:35.430 --> 07:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
your time i appreciate what we've been
 
07:46:36.948 --> 07:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
kind of doing here for the past little
 
07:46:36.958 --> 07:46:37.990 align:start position:0%
kind of doing here for the past little
bit

07:46:37.990 --> 07:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
bit
 
07:46:38.000 --> 07:46:39.110 align:start position:0%
bit
um

07:46:39.110 --> 07:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:46:41.110 --> 07:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
my name is dr jillian schilleber i'm a
 
07:46:42.788 --> 07:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
licensed clinical psychologist here in
 
07:46:43.830 --> 07:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire and i
 
07:46:45.270 --> 07:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate a couple of questions we're
 
07:46:47.670 --> 07:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
asked what are psychologists doing now
 
07:46:49.670 --> 07:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
as a result of this bill that was passed
 
07:46:51.510 --> 07:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
into law and so now we're trying to
 
07:46:54.708 --> 07:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
repeal it so i'm happy to speak to that
 
07:46:56.868 --> 07:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
but i just want to say for the record i
 
07:46:58.628 --> 07:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
don't practice conversion therapy i
 
07:47:01.030 --> 07:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
think you've heard that most of us say
 
07:47:02.868 --> 07:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
we don't do that
 
07:47:04.788 --> 07:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
um and there's a reason why
 
07:47:06.708 --> 07:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
which i'll get to in a minute but what i
 
07:47:08.388 --> 07:47:08.398 align:start position:0%
want to acknowledge is that this bill
 
07:47:10.868 --> 07:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
isn't just about conversion therapy if
 
07:47:12.548 --> 07:47:12.558 align:start position:0%
it was nobody would be testifying to
 
07:47:12.558 --> 07:47:13.510 align:start position:0%
it was nobody would be testifying to
repeal

07:47:13.510 --> 07:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
07:47:15.190 --> 07:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
the law
 
07:47:17.510 --> 07:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
what this bill does it actually seeks to
 
07:47:20.548 --> 07:47:20.558 align:start position:0%
reinstate client autonomy
 
07:47:23.190 --> 07:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
and dignity that was stripped away
 
07:47:26.150 --> 07:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
from the law when gender and sexuality
 
07:47:28.310 --> 07:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
was over regulated by the law that's
 
07:47:30.310 --> 07:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
currently on the books
 
07:47:32.628 --> 07:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
as you've heard we have various every
 
07:47:33.990 --> 07:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know american counseling association
 
07:47:36.070 --> 07:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
american psychological association all
 
07:47:38.788 --> 07:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
the outfits right we all have ethical
 
07:47:41.430 --> 07:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
codes that that guide our decision
 
07:47:44.628 --> 07:47:44.638 align:start position:0%
making in the therapy environment
 
07:47:44.638 --> 07:47:45.990 align:start position:0%
making in the therapy environment
so

07:47:45.990 --> 07:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:47:48.388 --> 07:47:48.398 align:start position:0%
we don't push an agenda as mental health
 
07:47:50.708 --> 07:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
professionals that's not why we got our
 
07:47:52.150 --> 07:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
degrees that's not why we're helping
 
07:47:52.160 --> 07:47:53.590 align:start position:0%
degrees that's not why we're helping
people

07:47:53.590 --> 07:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
people
 
07:47:55.670 --> 07:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
but the current law actually pushes an
 
07:47:57.990 --> 07:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
agenda of limiting mental health
 
07:47:59.750 --> 07:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
professionals such as professionals such
 
07:48:02.948 --> 07:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
as myself to only talk about one
 
07:48:04.868 --> 07:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
possibility for an individual seeking
 
07:48:07.750 --> 07:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
help okay but this bill allows mental
 
07:48:09.750 --> 07:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
health providers to meet the needs of
 
07:48:11.910 --> 07:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
the clients who are seeking who are
 
07:48:14.388 --> 07:48:14.398 align:start position:0%
questioning who are deciding who they
 
07:48:14.398 --> 07:48:15.270 align:start position:0%
questioning who are deciding who they
are

07:48:15.270 --> 07:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
07:48:18.788 --> 07:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
in a safe space devoid of judgment
 
07:48:20.788 --> 07:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
it's my opinion that individuals can be
 
07:48:22.948 --> 07:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
more harmed when they don't have that
 
07:48:25.990 --> 07:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity when they can't talk through
 
07:48:28.948 --> 07:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
deeply personal decisions with a neutral
 
07:48:31.910 --> 07:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
party who is not their family who is not
 
07:48:33.110 --> 07:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
their friends
 
07:48:35.190 --> 07:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
somebody who can say kind of actually
 
07:48:37.430 --> 07:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
what somebody had said like it sounds
 
07:48:38.948 --> 07:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
like you're feeling conflicted like
 
07:48:41.510 --> 07:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
would you want to explore that with me
 
07:48:43.910 --> 07:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they will
 
07:48:46.070 --> 07:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they won't because they
 
07:48:48.628 --> 07:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
don't trust you yet it's a lot of hard
 
07:48:51.110 --> 07:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
work working with youngsters
 
07:48:53.270 --> 07:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
um it's easier for me because people
 
07:48:56.070 --> 07:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
don't believe how old i am
 
07:48:58.708 --> 07:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
you're probably like oh she's just 20.
 
07:48:59.990 --> 07:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not but i'm not going to say because
 
07:49:02.070 --> 07:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
i'm a lady
 
07:49:03.830 --> 07:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
i would just like to say that counselors
 
07:49:06.468 --> 07:49:06.478 align:start position:0%
cannot force anybody
 
07:49:06.478 --> 07:49:08.070 align:start position:0%
cannot force anybody
minor

07:49:08.070 --> 07:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
minor
 
07:49:08.080 --> 07:49:09.430 align:start position:0%
minor
major

07:49:09.430 --> 07:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
major
 
07:49:09.440 --> 07:49:10.230 align:start position:0%
major
right

07:49:10.230 --> 07:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:49:12.070 --> 07:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
those of us over the age of 18 they
 
07:49:14.150 --> 07:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
can't counselors don't force us into
 
07:49:16.070 --> 07:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
doing something
 
07:49:18.230 --> 07:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
however if a mental health provider is
 
07:49:21.270 --> 07:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
not adhering to our ethical guidelines
 
07:49:22.548 --> 07:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
that's a different story there's a
 
07:49:24.230 --> 07:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
complaint process in place we already
 
07:49:25.590 --> 07:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
heard about the board of psychology
 
07:49:28.788 --> 07:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
which i'm thankfully not acquainted with
 
07:49:30.788 --> 07:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
but i'm perplexed as to why the law was
 
07:49:32.310 --> 07:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
necessary when i know we have this
 
07:49:34.548 --> 07:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
system of checks and balances in place
 
07:49:34.558 --> 07:49:35.670 align:start position:0%
system of checks and balances in place
for

07:49:35.670 --> 07:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:49:38.070 --> 07:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
if someone were to perhaps do something
 
07:49:39.590 --> 07:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't
 
07:49:41.590 --> 07:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
but i feel like this bill eliminates
 
07:49:43.830 --> 07:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and harmful regulations
 
07:49:45.830 --> 07:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's why i support it
 
07:49:47.670 --> 07:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to talk about this further i
 
07:49:49.190 --> 07:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
know legislators aren't necessarily
 
07:49:51.190 --> 07:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
psychologists so if you have any
 
07:49:52.548 --> 07:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
questions about therapy if i could kind
 
07:49:54.230 --> 07:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
of talk through some of that
 
07:49:57.350 --> 07:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
i would be willing to answer questions
 
07:50:02.070 --> 07:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:05.190 --> 07:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
07:50:07.750 --> 07:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
07:50:10.788 --> 07:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
what part of the current law
 
07:50:10.798 --> 07:50:11.750 align:start position:0%
what part of the current law
is

07:50:11.750 --> 07:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:50:13.990 --> 07:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
the the poison pen
 
07:50:15.990 --> 07:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
that prohibits you
 
07:50:16.000 --> 07:50:17.190 align:start position:0%
that prohibits you
from

07:50:17.190 --> 07:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:50:19.990 --> 07:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
allowing people and reflecting
 
07:50:22.868 --> 07:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
any other thought besides
 
07:50:26.150 --> 07:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
besides what seems to be
 
07:50:29.510 --> 07:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
the only the only acceptable
 
07:50:29.520 --> 07:50:31.030 align:start position:0%
the only the only acceptable
outcome

07:50:31.030 --> 07:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
07:50:33.590 --> 07:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so i echo the concern is it still
 
07:50:37.270 --> 07:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
on about seeks to change um in the sense
 
07:50:37.280 --> 07:50:38.468 align:start position:0%
on about seeks to change um in the sense
of

07:50:38.468 --> 07:50:38.478 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:50:40.868 --> 07:50:40.878 align:start position:0%
counseling is about changing it's about
 
07:50:43.510 --> 07:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
growing it's about becoming who you are
 
07:50:44.468 --> 07:50:44.478 align:start position:0%
and as
 
07:50:46.708 --> 07:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
you know now as adults that change
 
07:50:49.430 --> 07:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
process is much narrower in the sense of
 
07:50:50.948 --> 07:50:50.958 align:start position:0%
you know maybe i want to change how i
 
07:50:53.510 --> 07:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
respond and anger to my kids when they
 
07:50:55.830 --> 07:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
do something they shouldn't
 
07:50:58.628 --> 07:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
whereas now in adolescence it might be
 
07:50:58.638 --> 07:50:59.510 align:start position:0%
whereas now in adolescence it might be
like

07:50:59.510 --> 07:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
like
 
07:51:02.070 --> 07:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
you know i want to change who my friend
 
07:51:04.230 --> 07:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
group is like how do i break out of this
 
07:51:04.240 --> 07:51:05.350 align:start position:0%
group is like how do i break out of this
situation

07:51:05.350 --> 07:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
situation
 
07:51:08.150 --> 07:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
and so it's kind of like
 
07:51:09.990 --> 07:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
what does that mean like what does it
 
07:51:12.150 --> 07:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
mean to to for
 
07:51:14.788 --> 07:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
the law makes it feel like to me
 
07:51:17.430 --> 07:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
that if i were to say to somebody like
 
07:51:19.750 --> 07:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay you're wrestling with whatever this
 
07:51:22.788 --> 07:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
is sexuality sexuality gender stuff
 
07:51:25.190 --> 07:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
anything with in the realm of gender
 
07:51:25.200 --> 07:51:27.750 align:start position:0%
anything with in the realm of gender
sexuality

07:51:27.750 --> 07:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
sexuality
 
07:51:28.948 --> 07:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
if they were to go back to their friends
 
07:51:30.230 --> 07:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
and say i'm talking with a therapist
 
07:51:30.240 --> 07:51:32.230 align:start position:0%
and say i'm talking with a therapist
about

07:51:32.230 --> 07:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:51:34.830 --> 07:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
becoming let's say straight
 
07:51:37.350 --> 07:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
right and i would say well but that's
 
07:51:39.750 --> 07:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
not what we're doing like that's not my
 
07:51:42.150 --> 07:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
my goal my goal is to support you where
 
07:51:43.990 --> 07:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
you are in your gender and sexuality as
 
07:51:47.030 --> 07:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
it evolves and changes
 
07:51:48.388 --> 07:51:48.398 align:start position:0%
but that
 
07:51:51.590 --> 07:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
this kind of limitation it feels it's
 
07:51:52.708 --> 07:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
kind of like if somebody were to come
 
07:51:54.788 --> 07:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
into your bedroom it's like that i'm a
 
07:51:56.310 --> 07:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
psychologist and i'm here and i'm
 
07:51:57.750 --> 07:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
counseling with people and we're working
 
07:51:59.910 --> 07:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
together and but now i'm worried about
 
07:51:59.920 --> 07:52:00.708 align:start position:0%
together and but now i'm worried about
like

07:52:00.708 --> 07:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
like
 
07:52:03.430 --> 07:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
who else is in the room with me
 
07:52:04.788 --> 07:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
it's not just about me and the client
 
07:52:06.948 --> 07:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
anymore it's like am i adhering to this
 
07:52:09.030 --> 07:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
law am i saying too much am i saying too
 
07:52:12.150 --> 07:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
little it feels intrusive
 
07:52:14.468 --> 07:52:14.478 align:start position:0%
it kind of it's i don't know if i'm
 
07:52:17.510 --> 07:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
being clear about how i'm feeling but
 
07:52:19.110 --> 07:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
to the point i haven't seen adolescents
 
07:52:21.190 --> 07:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
since this bill passed
 
07:52:23.350 --> 07:52:23.360 align:start position:0%

coming before us and now we're at that
 
07:52:32.788 --> 07:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
magic time in a hearing where the clock
 
07:52:37.590 --> 07:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
is ticking and the pink cards are many
 
07:52:39.510 --> 07:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
and i looked through them and most
 
07:52:41.830 --> 07:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
people asked for either two or three
 
07:52:44.070 --> 07:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
minutes and in the grand tradition of
 
07:52:47.190 --> 07:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
this place of trying to square circles
 
07:52:49.590 --> 07:52:49.600 align:start position:0%

this

07:55:54.868 --> 07:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
as such removing the ban on conversion
 
07:55:57.350 --> 07:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
therapy not only goes against sound
 
07:55:59.990 --> 07:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
psychologi scientific evidence but will
 
07:56:02.468 --> 07:56:02.478 align:start position:0%
increase the chances that lgbt
 
07:56:04.628 --> 07:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
plus children and youth
 
07:56:06.948 --> 07:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
15 seconds to wrap up yes we'll

experience negative health outcomes
 
07:56:11.030 --> 07:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
therefore new futures urges this

07:56:39.030 --> 07:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
i'll be giving you back a minute and a
 
07:56:40.468 --> 07:56:40.478 align:start position:0%
half because most of what i wanted to
 
07:56:42.150 --> 07:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
say has already been said
 
07:56:42.160 --> 07:56:43.030 align:start position:0%
say has already been said
but

07:56:43.030 --> 07:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:56:45.110 --> 07:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
you know i view the conversion therapy
 
07:56:45.120 --> 07:56:45.910 align:start position:0%
you know i view the conversion therapy
as

07:56:45.910 --> 07:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
as
 
07:56:47.670 --> 07:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
a treatment that is
 
07:56:49.110 --> 07:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
should be part of the spectrum of
 
07:56:51.030 --> 07:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
offerings we have for people who are
 
07:56:54.788 --> 07:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
inclined to enter the lgbtq community or
 
07:56:56.150 --> 07:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
to do uh
 
07:56:58.388 --> 07:56:58.398 align:start position:0%
sex change i don't have strong feelings
 
07:57:00.230 --> 07:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
about these people one way or another
 
07:57:01.430 --> 07:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
they can do what they want it's fine
 
07:57:03.590 --> 07:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
with me right but i think that uh the
 
07:57:05.030 --> 07:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
kids need to have all the options
 
07:57:06.548 --> 07:57:06.558 align:start position:0%
presented to them they are at a point in
 
07:57:07.990 --> 07:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
their life where they're confused
 
07:57:10.468 --> 07:57:10.478 align:start position:0%
vulnerable uh to suggestions and very
 
07:57:13.110 --> 07:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
impressionable right so for us to not
 
07:57:15.990 --> 07:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
offer all available options including
 
07:57:18.070 --> 07:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
instances where someone may have
 
07:57:19.910 --> 07:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
unwanted confusion
 
07:57:23.670 --> 07:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
about conversion or about lgbtq
 
07:57:23.680 --> 07:57:25.430 align:start position:0%
about conversion or about lgbtq
society

07:57:25.430 --> 07:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
society
 
07:57:28.150 --> 07:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
they ought to be offered the option to
 
07:57:30.468 --> 07:57:30.478 align:start position:0%
to work with a counselor
 
07:57:32.388 --> 07:57:32.398 align:start position:0%
to be able to be
 
07:57:34.230 --> 07:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
prevented from entering those things if
 
07:57:36.468 --> 07:57:36.478 align:start position:0%
that's what they want and by the law
 
07:57:37.910 --> 07:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
that we currently have in place we're
 
07:57:40.070 --> 07:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
removing that option from the table for
 
07:57:41.350 --> 07:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
those kids
 
07:57:43.510 --> 07:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
right so i think we need to we need to
 
07:57:45.670 --> 07:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
pass this bill um you know the the
 
07:57:47.190 --> 07:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
decisions that are being made here
 
07:57:49.430 --> 07:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
remember these are kids right our life
 
07:57:52.468 --> 07:57:52.478 align:start position:0%
threat are life-altering and in most
 
07:57:54.388 --> 07:57:54.398 align:start position:0%
cases irreversible
 
07:57:55.830 --> 07:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
right so the decisions that are made
 
07:57:57.590 --> 07:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
here these kids are not going to be able
 
07:57:59.190 --> 07:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
to back out of them later in life if
 
07:58:02.230 --> 07:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
they want to and i've seen videos of
 
07:58:03.990 --> 07:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
of of kids who
 
07:58:06.468 --> 07:58:06.478 align:start position:0%
have been 95 through the conversion
 
07:58:08.628 --> 07:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
process and then change their mind when
 
07:58:10.948 --> 07:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
they're an adult and they're trying to
 
07:58:10.958 --> 07:58:12.310 align:start position:0%
they're an adult and they're trying to
deconvert

07:58:12.310 --> 07:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
deconvert
 
07:58:13.910 --> 07:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
and they're a mess
 
07:58:16.150 --> 07:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
and talk about suicide rates you know
 
07:58:17.750 --> 07:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's there we need
 
07:58:19.990 --> 07:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive therapy therapy for these
 
07:58:22.628 --> 07:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
kids that includes all options not
 
07:58:24.948 --> 07:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
ideology and i'll give back the rest of
 
07:58:27.830 --> 07:58:27.840 align:start position:0%

07:59:09.190 --> 07:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
we've already talked about most of the
 
07:59:10.708 --> 07:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
reasons why we have concerns with this
 
07:59:13.270 --> 07:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
legislation um i'll focus on one thing i
 
07:59:14.788 --> 07:59:14.798 align:start position:0%
feel like this conversation we've really
 
07:59:16.548 --> 07:59:16.558 align:start position:0%
conflated two things we've completed
 
07:59:18.548 --> 07:59:18.558 align:start position:0%
therapy with junk science
 
07:59:21.190 --> 07:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy is junk science
 
07:59:23.830 --> 07:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
this is not me the aclu saying this
 
07:59:26.388 --> 07:59:26.398 align:start position:0%
a number of the organizations national
 
07:59:27.750 --> 07:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
medical association has already been
 
07:59:27.760 --> 07:59:28.788 align:start position:0%
medical association has already been
mentioned

07:59:28.788 --> 07:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
07:59:30.548 --> 07:59:30.558 align:start position:0%
but conversion therapy is based on
 
07:59:32.150 --> 07:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
understanding of sexual orientation that
 
07:59:33.830 --> 07:59:33.840 align:start position:0%

again this is not aclu these are the

major medical associations of our
 
08:00:07.350 --> 08:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
country have come out and said again
 
08:00:09.030 --> 08:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
that this is not therapy we're talking
 
08:00:10.628 --> 08:00:10.638 align:start position:0%
about this is junk science we're talking
 
08:00:10.638 --> 08:00:11.510 align:start position:0%
about this is junk science we're talking
about

08:00:11.510 --> 08:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
08:00:13.190 --> 08:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's important that we don't allow junk
 
08:00:16.230 --> 08:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
science into medical profession and the
 
08:00:17.910 --> 08:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
replicable harm is nami mentioned that
 
08:00:19.110 --> 08:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
this can have
 
08:00:21.430 --> 08:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
on kids in our community so thank you
 
08:00:22.948 --> 08:00:22.958 align:start position:0%
and we hope that you oppose this bill
 
08:00:26.070 --> 08:00:26.080 align:start position:0%

consider my words in support of hb-1077
 
08:01:07.830 --> 08:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
in my opinion house bill 1077 should
 
08:01:10.388 --> 08:01:10.398 align:start position:0%
pass for three primary reasons one new
 
08:01:11.750 --> 08:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire's conversion ban prevents
 
08:01:13.350 --> 08:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
willing participants from exercising
 
08:01:14.948 --> 08:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
their constitutionally recognized right
 
08:01:16.310 --> 08:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
to conscience
 
08:01:17.750 --> 08:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
two new hampshire's conversion therapy
 
08:01:19.910 --> 08:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
bans is currently defined can negatively
 
08:01:21.750 --> 08:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
impact children particularly children
 
08:01:23.750 --> 08:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with gender dysphoria
 
08:01:25.030 --> 08:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
and three when the state takes away

parents lose as well
 
08:01:30.388 --> 08:01:30.398 align:start position:0%
first conversion bands restrict willing
 
08:01:31.910 --> 08:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
participants from exercising their
 
08:01:33.830 --> 08:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
unalienable constitutionally recognized
 
08:01:35.510 --> 08:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
rights of conscience
 
08:01:37.190 --> 08:01:37.200 align:start position:0%

08:01:39.190 --> 08:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
therapy as a discredited practice linked
 
08:01:41.430 --> 08:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
to physical abuse drug use and suicide
 
08:01:43.110 --> 08:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
and they point to politicized statements
 
08:01:45.030 --> 08:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
from medical associations and activist
 
08:01:47.510 --> 08:01:47.520 align:start position:0%

otherwise clearly harmful practices
 
08:01:53.990 --> 08:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
which can and should be prosecuted under

existing law conversion therapy bans as
 
08:01:57.830 --> 08:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
they are currently advocated for are not
 
08:01:59.990 --> 08:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
targeted at particular practices but
 
08:02:01.910 --> 08:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
instead of particular values

08:02:06.868 --> 08:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
because they disagree with particular

views about human sexuality and biology
 
08:02:11.430 --> 08:02:11.440 align:start position:0%

legitimate legitimate needs of those who

trends
 
08:03:11.430 --> 08:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
only then will our public policy
 
08:03:13.030 --> 08:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
simultaneously protect and respect the

experiencing gender dysphoria
 
08:03:26.468 --> 08:03:26.478 align:start position:0%
there's strong evidence for the
 
08:03:27.990 --> 08:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of a watchful waiting

types of therapies are largely precluded

by the bill as it currently stands thank
 
08:03:45.350 --> 08:03:45.360 align:start position:0%

that you said that the i if i heard you
 
08:04:11.350 --> 08:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
correctly the
 
08:04:14.548 --> 08:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy ban is not directed
 
08:04:17.270 --> 08:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
against practices but against values is
 
08:04:19.030 --> 08:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
that what i heard you say yes that's
 
08:04:21.270 --> 08:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
what i said okay thank you that's that i
 
08:04:23.590 --> 08:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
had not thought of it that way before
 
08:04:23.600 --> 08:04:25.030 align:start position:0%
had not thought of it that way before
yeah

08:04:25.030 --> 08:04:25.040 align:start position:0%

organizations
 
08:05:13.430 --> 08:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
oppose conversion therapy and have
 
08:05:15.350 --> 08:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
supported nation bands across the
 
08:05:17.030 --> 08:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
country including the one here in new

08:05:22.868 --> 08:05:22.878 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
08:05:25.910 --> 08:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
really is being mispresented
 
08:05:28.310 --> 08:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
and misunderstood
 
08:05:30.310 --> 08:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
08:05:31.750 --> 08:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
seeks to ban
 
08:05:33.990 --> 08:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
an intervention referred to as quote
 
08:05:36.310 --> 08:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy
 
08:05:40.310 --> 08:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
that it has since 2018 banned that
 
08:05:43.190 --> 08:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
this was a it was and is a coercive
 
08:05:43.200 --> 08:05:46.070 align:start position:0%
this was a it was and is a coercive
intervention

08:05:46.070 --> 08:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:05:47.430 --> 08:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
which starts from the premise that
 
08:05:47.440 --> 08:05:49.990 align:start position:0%
which starts from the premise that
homosexuality

08:05:49.990 --> 08:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
homosexuality
 
08:05:53.110 --> 08:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
or gender non-conformity is wrong
 
08:05:55.670 --> 08:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
or bad or evil or whatever the term
 
08:05:57.830 --> 08:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
would be that people would put on it
 
08:06:01.270 --> 08:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
it seeks to protect children
 
08:06:05.270 --> 08:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:05.280 --> 08:06:06.628 align:start position:0%
 
purveyors

08:06:06.628 --> 08:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
purveyors
 
08:06:08.468 --> 08:06:08.478 align:start position:0%
of this type of intervention that's what
 
08:06:09.510 --> 08:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
it does
 
08:06:11.270 --> 08:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
it does not stop
 
08:06:11.280 --> 08:06:12.788 align:start position:0%
it does not stop
adults

08:06:12.788 --> 08:06:12.798 align:start position:0%
adults
 
08:06:14.788 --> 08:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
from seeking out conversion therapy it
 
08:06:18.150 --> 08:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
see it prevents therapists from engaging
 
08:06:20.868 --> 08:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
this practice with children does not
 
08:06:22.948 --> 08:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
affect what children can or cannot talk
 
08:06:22.958 --> 08:06:24.230 align:start position:0%
affect what children can or cannot talk
about

08:06:24.230 --> 08:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
08:06:27.270 --> 08:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
it only affects the intent of the
 
08:06:31.110 --> 08:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
therapist to confirm for a child that
 
08:06:33.110 --> 08:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
their feelings of
 
08:06:35.110 --> 08:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
gender non-conformity
 
08:06:37.270 --> 08:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
or homosexuality
 
08:06:41.110 --> 08:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
are bad or wrong and should be changed
 
08:06:43.270 --> 08:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
as far as legislation goes this is
 
08:06:45.510 --> 08:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
fairly well written
 
08:06:47.750 --> 08:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
now legislation as you all know is
 
08:06:49.510 --> 08:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
inherently difficult to understand i
 
08:06:52.868 --> 08:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
think of conversations around rsa 126u
 
08:06:52.878 --> 08:06:54.628 align:start position:0%
think of conversations around rsa 126u
169b

08:06:54.628 --> 08:06:54.638 align:start position:0%
169b
 
08:06:57.190 --> 08:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
and many other statutes
 
08:06:59.030 --> 08:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
that in some cases there is many
 
08:07:02.628 --> 08:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
opinions as there are people in the room
 
08:07:04.548 --> 08:07:04.558 align:start position:0%
an opinion doesn't
 
08:07:06.230 --> 08:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
equate to fact
 
08:07:09.510 --> 08:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that's what the law says
 
08:07:11.670 --> 08:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
and i guess if you if you folks truly
 
08:07:13.350 --> 08:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
want to get to the bottom of whether
 
08:07:15.190 --> 08:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
there are issues with this i would
 
08:07:16.548 --> 08:07:16.558 align:start position:0%
encourage you to reach out to all the
 
08:07:18.788 --> 08:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
mental health boards
 
08:07:21.030 --> 08:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
ask the mental health boards how many
 
08:07:23.110 --> 08:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
cases have been brought forward how many
 
08:07:26.310 --> 08:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
clinicians have complained about i'm
 
08:07:28.388 --> 08:07:28.398 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to wrap it up clarity
 
08:07:28.398 --> 08:07:29.110 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to wrap it up clarity
in

08:07:29.110 --> 08:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
08:07:31.510 --> 08:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
understanding this statute that is the
 
08:07:33.830 --> 08:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
answer to the testimony that says this
 
08:07:36.548 --> 08:07:36.558 align:start position:0%
is a problem it's not a problem
 
08:07:39.030 --> 08:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
and the boards can confirm that and with
 
08:07:41.190 --> 08:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
that i will end my testimony thank you
 
08:07:43.590 --> 08:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
and would you take questions of course
 
08:07:45.190 --> 08:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the law
 
08:07:46.948 --> 08:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
that my
 
08:07:50.150 --> 08:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
assistant chair has up on her computer
 
08:07:52.948 --> 08:07:52.958 align:start position:0%
and under item 3
 
08:07:55.750 --> 08:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
it says nothing in this chapter shall be
 
08:07:57.430 --> 08:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
construed to infringe on any
 
08:07:59.270 --> 08:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional right including the
 
08:08:02.708 --> 08:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
exercise of religion in two the people
 
08:08:06.388 --> 08:08:06.398 align:start position:0%
who cannot do conversion therapy include
 
08:08:09.030 --> 08:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
doctors psychologists and so on what if
 
08:08:10.788 --> 08:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
there's a christian organization with a
 
08:08:13.270 --> 08:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
physician does three trump two or two
 
08:08:14.388 --> 08:08:14.398 align:start position:0%
trump three
 
08:08:16.388 --> 08:08:16.398 align:start position:0%
it's a great question in in the
 
08:08:19.270 --> 08:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
interpretation of statute um it would go
 
08:08:20.948 --> 08:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
to the supreme court to determine that
 
08:08:22.548 --> 08:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
and if the court is unable to determine
 
08:08:24.310 --> 08:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
it would go to legislative intent which
 
08:08:25.990 --> 08:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
would require us to pull up the minutes
 
08:08:27.350 --> 08:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
of this
 
08:08:29.430 --> 08:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
four year ago event
 
08:08:29.440 --> 08:08:30.230 align:start position:0%
four year ago event
so

08:08:30.230 --> 08:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:08:32.150 --> 08:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
i can't answer that i can give an
 
08:08:33.830 --> 08:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
opinion but my opinion is as good as
 
08:08:35.830 --> 08:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
anybody else's i think i was the clerk
 
08:08:37.830 --> 08:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
that year so i hope it doesn't go that
 
08:08:40.230 --> 08:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
far okay thank you very much anybody
 
08:08:42.388 --> 08:08:42.398 align:start position:0%
else with a question uh representative
 
08:08:44.708 --> 08:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
leon thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
08:08:46.548 --> 08:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
for taking this question
 
08:08:47.990 --> 08:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
i'm curious if you believe that the
 
08:08:50.230 --> 08:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
licensing boards are capable of
 
08:08:52.310 --> 08:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
protecting children and other patients
 
08:08:55.430 --> 08:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
from unscrupulous doc practitioners
 
08:08:56.868 --> 08:08:56.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the licensing
 
08:08:58.948 --> 08:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
boards primarily are not
 
08:09:01.430 --> 08:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
charged with protecting children
 
08:09:03.990 --> 08:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's what dcyf does the licensing
 
08:09:06.310 --> 08:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
boards are charged with enforcing
 
08:09:06.320 --> 08:09:07.670 align:start position:0%
boards are charged with enforcing
statute

08:09:07.670 --> 08:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
statute
 
08:09:10.468 --> 08:09:10.478 align:start position:0%
and and board rules
 
08:09:13.350 --> 08:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
in the practice of mental health
 
08:09:13.360 --> 08:09:14.388 align:start position:0%
in the practice of mental health
so

08:09:14.388 --> 08:09:14.398 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:09:16.468 --> 08:09:16.478 align:start position:0%
i don't i wouldn't suggest that the
 
08:09:18.310 --> 08:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
boards are incapable of protecting kids
 
08:09:20.628 --> 08:09:20.638 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that that is not their
 
08:09:22.868 --> 08:09:22.878 align:start position:0%
primary charge their primary charge is
 
08:09:24.628 --> 08:09:24.638 align:start position:0%
to enforce rule and law
 
08:09:24.638 --> 08:09:25.830 align:start position:0%
to enforce rule and law
follow-up

08:09:25.830 --> 08:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
08:09:27.270 --> 08:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:09:28.948 --> 08:09:28.958 align:start position:0%
are you trying to say that the licensing
 
08:09:31.350 --> 08:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations don't apply to
 
08:09:32.830 --> 08:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
practitioners who are working with
 
08:09:35.350 --> 08:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
children great question and thank you
 
08:09:38.468 --> 08:09:38.478 align:start position:0%
very much no i it's a matter of focus
 
08:09:40.070 --> 08:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know it's
 
08:09:41.910 --> 08:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
we don't send abuse and neglect
 
08:09:43.590 --> 08:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
petitions to the licensing boards we
 
08:09:45.350 --> 08:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
send those to dcyf
 
08:09:47.110 --> 08:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
what the licensing boards are charged
 
08:09:50.150 --> 08:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
with is overseeing the the practice of
 
08:09:50.160 --> 08:09:51.350 align:start position:0%
with is overseeing the the practice of
professionals

08:09:51.350 --> 08:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
08:09:54.070 --> 08:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that a complaint
 
08:09:56.070 --> 08:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
of a professional practicing with
 
08:09:59.190 --> 08:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
children in an unscrupulous or unethical
 
08:10:01.510 --> 08:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
manner they of course would address that
 
08:10:04.070 --> 08:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
but they're addressing the behavior of
 
08:10:06.468 --> 08:10:06.478 align:start position:0%
the professional that is their focus and
 
08:10:08.868 --> 08:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
they do that quite well
 
08:10:08.878 --> 08:10:10.070 align:start position:0%
they do that quite well
um

08:10:10.070 --> 08:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:10:12.548 --> 08:10:12.558 align:start position:0%
i i'd like to raise something i raised
 
08:10:15.190 --> 08:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
one of the last times this came up
 
08:10:17.590 --> 08:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
and that is as i look at
 
08:10:20.310 --> 08:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
the people who are not allowed to do
 
08:10:22.310 --> 08:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy
 
08:10:23.830 --> 08:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
they're all medical and counseling
 
08:10:23.840 --> 08:10:25.110 align:start position:0%
they're all medical and counseling
professionals

08:10:25.110 --> 08:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
08:10:27.910 --> 08:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
not basketball coaches
 
08:10:27.920 --> 08:10:29.430 align:start position:0%
not basketball coaches
not

08:10:29.430 --> 08:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
08:10:31.030 --> 08:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
the nice guy who loves all the kids in
 
08:10:32.468 --> 08:10:32.478 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood that's what i mean
 
08:10:35.910 --> 08:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
genuinely truly so not the pastor
 
08:10:38.070 --> 08:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
and as i look at this i know just enough
 
08:10:40.628 --> 08:10:40.638 align:start position:0%
about counseling to know how far i
 
08:10:42.788 --> 08:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
shouldn't go beyond
 
08:10:46.230 --> 08:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
and if there's a child who is
 
08:10:48.150 --> 08:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
really troubled and again we go back to
 
08:10:50.070 --> 08:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
the confusion in the minds of a lot of
 
08:10:52.310 --> 08:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
people as to what conversion therapy is
 
08:10:54.230 --> 08:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
banning and what it isn't in spite of
 
08:10:58.388 --> 08:10:58.398 align:start position:0%
what it says there's a lot of confusion
 
08:11:00.310 --> 08:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
if somebody cannot find a
 
08:11:04.310 --> 08:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
licensed trained psychotherapist
 
08:11:06.468 --> 08:11:06.478 align:start position:0%
and has to go to the basketball coach or
 
08:11:06.478 --> 08:11:07.590 align:start position:0%
and has to go to the basketball coach or
me

08:11:07.590 --> 08:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
me
 
08:11:09.670 --> 08:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
i'd worry because i think a trained
 
08:11:11.270 --> 08:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
therapist knows more about counseling
 
08:11:12.948 --> 08:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
than i do
 
08:11:14.150 --> 08:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
and so
 
08:11:16.628 --> 08:11:16.638 align:start position:0%
any questions i can respond to uh well
 
08:11:18.070 --> 08:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
i'm getting towards the question thank
 
08:11:19.990 --> 08:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
you for reminding us of that
 
08:11:20.000 --> 08:11:21.670 align:start position:0%
you for reminding us of that
um

08:11:21.670 --> 08:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:11:24.070 --> 08:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
would you understand my concern should
 
08:11:27.350 --> 08:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
this happen
 
08:11:29.190 --> 08:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
i would understand your concerns should
 
08:11:31.830 --> 08:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
it happen i would allay your concerns
 
08:11:33.750 --> 08:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
that that is not what's happening it is
 
08:11:36.070 --> 08:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
in fact true as as speakers have
 
08:11:37.990 --> 08:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
testified that it's difficult to find a
 
08:11:39.830 --> 08:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
mental health professional
 
08:11:41.190 --> 08:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
it's not difficult to find a mental
 
08:11:42.150 --> 08:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
health professional because they're
 
08:11:44.230 --> 08:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
afraid of the statute it's difficult to
 
08:11:45.670 --> 08:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
find a mental health professional
 
08:11:48.230 --> 08:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
because of parity because of clawback
 
08:11:51.350 --> 08:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
because of acts the ability to be
 
08:11:53.270 --> 08:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursed at a fair rate for their
 
08:11:55.190 --> 08:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
services that's why it's difficult to
 
08:11:56.548 --> 08:11:56.558 align:start position:0%
find a mental health professional i can
 
08:11:58.230 --> 08:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
in fact tell you of a survey from the
 
08:12:00.468 --> 08:12:00.478 align:start position:0%
new hampshire psychological association
 
08:12:03.350 --> 08:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
that a significant number of their
 
08:12:04.548 --> 08:12:04.558 align:start position:0%
members and i'm not going to say a
 
08:12:06.310 --> 08:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
number because i don't remember a
 
08:12:08.388 --> 08:12:08.398 align:start position:0%
significant number of their members
 
08:12:11.750 --> 08:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
are contemplating dis and paneling
 
08:12:14.310 --> 08:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
from insurance providers and only
 
08:12:16.468 --> 08:12:16.478 align:start position:0%
accepting cash because the providers are
 
08:12:18.310 --> 08:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
so difficult to work with that's why
 
08:12:19.750 --> 08:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's so difficult to find mental health
 
08:12:19.760 --> 08:12:21.350 align:start position:0%
it's so difficult to find mental health
professionals

08:12:21.350 --> 08:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
08:12:22.788 --> 08:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
it wasn't my question but i think
 
08:12:24.310 --> 08:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative webber did you have your
 
08:12:29.270 --> 08:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:33.270 --> 08:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
i did but i think that you've probably
 
08:12:37.430 --> 08:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
answered it my question was
 
08:12:40.150 --> 08:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that the licensing boards
 
08:12:40.160 --> 08:12:40.868 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that the licensing boards
are

08:12:40.868 --> 08:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
are
 
08:12:43.670 --> 08:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
reactive in that they react to
 
08:12:45.670 --> 08:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
complaints they
 
08:12:45.680 --> 08:12:46.868 align:start position:0%
complaints they
don't

08:12:46.868 --> 08:12:46.878 align:start position:0%
don't
 
08:12:46.878 --> 08:12:48.388 align:start position:0%
don't
so

08:12:48.388 --> 08:12:48.398 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:12:51.110 --> 08:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
what they do depends on what somebody's
 
08:12:52.948 --> 08:12:52.958 align:start position:0%
told them
 
08:12:57.750 --> 08:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:13:01.350 --> 08:13:01.360 align:start position:0%

08:13:24.628 --> 08:13:24.638 align:start position:0%
tend to be in the

hb1077
 
08:13:32.628 --> 08:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
let me first start out by saying that
 
08:13:35.670 --> 08:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
we've all seen what i think is
 
08:13:38.708 --> 08:13:38.718 align:start position:0%
considered conversion therapy on tv and
 
08:13:41.910 --> 08:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
it was a shocking and abusive treatment
 
08:13:43.350 --> 08:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
so i want to make it clear that in no
 
08:13:46.310 --> 08:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
way do i want there to be any confusion
 
08:13:48.948 --> 08:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
that this kind of behavior is acceptable
 
08:13:51.030 --> 08:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
however as a parental rights advocate i
 
08:13:52.548 --> 08:13:52.558 align:start position:0%
want to be very careful that we never
 
08:13:55.190 --> 08:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
limit good therapy options for children
 
08:13:57.110 --> 08:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
who need it and i have parents who do
 
08:13:58.868 --> 08:13:58.878 align:start position:0%
come to me and i've had parents come to
 
08:14:00.628 --> 08:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
me on occasion i'm going to bring that
 
08:14:02.868 --> 08:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
up in my testimony
 
08:14:04.788 --> 08:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
so i hear from parents who have come
 
08:14:06.310 --> 08:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
into conflict with their school
 
08:14:07.910 --> 08:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
counselors on how best to help their
 
08:14:09.990 --> 08:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
children these are loving and caring
 
08:14:11.270 --> 08:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
parents who have
 
08:14:13.030 --> 08:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
seen deep-rooted issues that they want
 
08:14:15.750 --> 08:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
to address through therapy these are not
 
08:14:17.350 --> 08:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
parents who would agree to
 
08:14:19.670 --> 08:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
what has been reported in the news not
 
08:14:21.030 --> 08:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
08:14:22.628 --> 08:14:22.638 align:start position:0%
i will only support parents who are
 
08:14:24.150 --> 08:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
loving and supportive of their children
 
08:14:26.150 --> 08:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
no matter where that leads them
 
08:14:28.548 --> 08:14:28.558 align:start position:0%
i was going to read a one-page testimony
 
08:14:29.990 --> 08:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
from a parent
 
08:14:31.350 --> 08:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
that came to me because of what was
 
08:14:33.350 --> 08:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
happening to her daughter in their
 
08:14:35.670 --> 08:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
school district because this is a
 
08:14:37.590 --> 08:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
current and because the mother is a
 
08:14:39.590 --> 08:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
teacher in another school district we
 
08:14:41.750 --> 08:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
agreed that her testimony should be read
 
08:14:42.948 --> 08:14:42.958 align:start position:0%
by me
 
08:14:44.548 --> 08:14:44.558 align:start position:0%
so that it can remain anonymous but in
 
08:14:46.150 --> 08:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
the interest of time i'll just turn that
 
08:14:47.350 --> 08:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
into you
 
08:14:49.190 --> 08:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
in addition to the situation i will
 
08:14:51.430 --> 08:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
present another parent reached out to me
 
08:14:53.270 --> 08:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
a few years ago based on what was
 
08:14:55.190 --> 08:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
happening with her daughter and how the
 
08:14:57.350 --> 08:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
school counselors were were addressing
 
08:14:58.788 --> 08:14:58.798 align:start position:0%
the situation
 
08:15:00.468 --> 08:15:00.478 align:start position:0%
in this case the parents had adopted a
 
08:15:02.788 --> 08:15:02.798 align:start position:0%
brother and sister at a young age
 
08:15:04.468 --> 08:15:04.478 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire mother knew that the
 
08:15:06.788 --> 08:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
adopted children were traumatized by
 
08:15:08.948 --> 08:15:08.958 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse at a very young age
 
08:15:10.708 --> 08:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
when her daughter began puberty she
 
08:15:12.948 --> 08:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
began also dressing as a boy
 
08:15:14.388 --> 08:15:14.398 align:start position:0%
there was speculation that the girl
 
08:15:16.150 --> 08:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
believed that dressing as a boy she
 
08:15:18.468 --> 08:15:18.478 align:start position:0%
would appear less attractive to males
 
08:15:20.388 --> 08:15:20.398 align:start position:0%
it because it was the males in her life
 
08:15:22.468 --> 08:15:22.478 align:start position:0%
who had sexually abused and traumatized
 
08:15:25.030 --> 08:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
her so it wasn't surprising to them that
 
08:15:26.868 --> 08:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
she was acting out this way
 
08:15:28.948 --> 08:15:28.958 align:start position:0%
school counselors wanted to labor label
 
08:15:30.468 --> 08:15:30.478 align:start position:0%
her and treat her treat this girl
 
08:15:32.308 --> 08:15:32.318 align:start position:0%
according to their will but the mother
 
08:15:33.830 --> 08:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
wanted intensive therapy that would
 
08:15:36.070 --> 08:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
address her sexual abuse and trauma
 
08:15:38.150 --> 08:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
i tell you these stories because in both
 
08:15:42.788 --> 08:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:44.708 --> 08:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
there was underlying causes for their
 
08:15:46.468 --> 08:15:46.478 align:start position:0%
children their daughters to act out in a
 
08:15:47.990 --> 08:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
certain way
 
08:15:49.670 --> 08:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
they had underlying issues that only a
 
08:15:51.830 --> 08:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
good therapist could uncover and with
 
08:15:53.750 --> 08:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
the help from their therapist they had
 
08:15:55.430 --> 08:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
hoped that they would be able to help
 
08:15:57.670 --> 08:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
their daughters these are parents that
 
08:15:59.510 --> 08:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
would love accept and value their
 
08:16:01.430 --> 08:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
daughters if they were part of the lgbt
 
08:16:03.670 --> 08:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
community but they were also parents who
 
08:16:05.510 --> 08:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
knew that if they ignored the underlying
 
08:16:09.110 --> 08:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
conditions things can get a lot worse
 
08:16:11.110 --> 08:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
they knew that in order to help
 
08:16:12.868 --> 08:16:12.878 align:start position:0%
for their daughters that they needed to
 
08:16:15.350 --> 08:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
seek the best available therapists
 
08:16:17.110 --> 08:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
so that brings me to this conversion
 
08:16:18.388 --> 08:16:18.398 align:start position:0%
therapy ban
 
08:16:20.788 --> 08:16:20.798 align:start position:0%
you have about 30 seconds left my
 
08:16:22.388 --> 08:16:22.398 align:start position:0%
concern has always been are we going to
 
08:16:24.308 --> 08:16:24.318 align:start position:0%
handcuff good therapists with this law
 
08:16:26.070 --> 08:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
are we going to limit the choices for
 
08:16:28.308 --> 08:16:28.318 align:start position:0%
these parents these are parents who want
 
08:16:30.468 --> 08:16:30.478 align:start position:0%
no part of an abusive approach they want
 
08:16:32.948 --> 08:16:32.958 align:start position:0%
to make sure that whoever they use had
 
08:16:35.830 --> 08:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
the ability to practice what they can to
 
08:16:37.670 --> 08:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
help these children i think we've heard
 
08:16:39.830 --> 08:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
today that they're that some of them
 
08:16:41.670 --> 08:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
have had their hands cuffed
 
08:16:43.510 --> 08:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
tied behind their backs and that's not
 
08:16:45.270 --> 08:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
helping these children and it's not
 
08:16:46.788 --> 08:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
helping these families
 
08:16:48.468 --> 08:16:48.478 align:start position:0%
so thank you so much
 
08:16:51.750 --> 08:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
for your testimony yes thank you
 
08:16:55.590 --> 08:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes stephen and beth scare
 
08:16:57.548 --> 08:16:57.558 align:start position:0%
from nashua
 
08:16:59.990 --> 08:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
and you're going to get a total of four
 
08:17:09.350 --> 08:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:17:11.030 --> 08:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving me a moment to
 
08:17:14.150 --> 08:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
speak about this i'm concerned that laws
 
08:17:16.788 --> 08:17:16.798 align:start position:0%
such as ours prevent youth with gender
 
08:17:19.030 --> 08:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
dysphoria from getting the help that
 
08:17:20.948 --> 08:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
they need already
 
08:17:23.110 --> 08:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of wounded souls out there
 
08:17:25.350 --> 08:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
there's there's a reddit page that has
 
08:17:28.708 --> 08:17:28.718 align:start position:0%
almost 26 000 d transitioners people
 
08:17:31.190 --> 08:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
regret what happened to their bodies
 
08:17:32.948 --> 08:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
and they they frequently complained that
 
08:17:34.708 --> 08:17:34.718 align:start position:0%
there was no one there to put the brakes
 
08:17:36.230 --> 08:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
on their decisions and they they might
 
08:17:37.990 --> 08:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
be mistaken
 
08:17:40.708 --> 08:17:40.718 align:start position:0%
um i read the following post and i'll
 
08:17:43.030 --> 08:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
just read bits about why have trans
 
08:17:44.708 --> 08:17:44.718 align:start position:0%
activists pushed so hard for immediate
 
08:17:46.788 --> 08:17:46.798 align:start position:0%
medicalization of anyone who is
 
08:17:49.190 --> 08:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
experiencing even minor forms of gender
 
08:17:51.430 --> 08:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
discomfort dysphoria encouraging a
 
08:17:53.910 --> 08:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
lifestyle of doctors blood tests scans
 
08:17:56.788 --> 08:17:56.798 align:start position:0%
injections surgery even more surgery
 
08:17:58.548 --> 08:17:58.558 align:start position:0%
instead of just trying to talk for
 
08:17:59.990 --> 08:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
therapy first
 
08:18:02.230 --> 08:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
and he she goes on to say transition
 
08:18:05.350 --> 08:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
should be 100 the last resort not the
 
08:18:08.150 --> 08:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
first especially in the case of minors
 
08:18:10.150 --> 08:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
the law that we have and i think it came
 
08:18:11.948 --> 08:18:11.958 align:start position:0%
across means that we've got a
 
08:18:14.388 --> 08:18:14.398 align:start position:0%
one-size-fit-all approach which is
 
08:18:16.150 --> 08:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
affirmative therapy you can affirm the
 
08:18:18.150 --> 08:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
identity but people are afraid to say
 
08:18:19.510 --> 08:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
the opposite
 
08:18:21.670 --> 08:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
so several of the transitioners on the
 
08:18:23.590 --> 08:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
same site responded that their therapist
 
08:18:25.670 --> 08:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
hadn't helped them explore the mental
 
08:18:27.350 --> 08:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
health issues that were underlying the
 
08:18:30.388 --> 08:18:30.398 align:start position:0%
dysphoria before the medicalization and
 
08:18:33.830 --> 08:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
others noted in some states it's illegal
 
08:18:35.590 --> 08:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
to offer help than other than
 
08:18:37.270 --> 08:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
affirmative care
 
08:18:39.350 --> 08:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
one detransitioner suggested if you go
 
08:18:41.510 --> 08:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
to a therapist who has experience with
 
08:18:44.788 --> 08:18:44.798 align:start position:0%
lgbtq people but is not gender affirming
 
08:18:47.910 --> 08:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
they can help also if you're in the u.s
 
08:18:50.948 --> 08:18:50.958 align:start position:0%
some states require all therapists to
 
08:18:54.070 --> 08:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
obey the affirmative care model so hop
 
08:18:57.590 --> 08:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
on psychology today find a therapy
 
08:18:59.190 --> 08:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
therapist who's not from one of those
 
08:19:01.990 --> 08:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
states and go on online sessions right
 
08:19:04.070 --> 08:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
now for our youth we are one of those
 
08:19:04.080 --> 08:19:05.270 align:start position:0%
now for our youth we are one of those
states

08:19:05.270 --> 08:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
states
 
08:19:07.270 --> 08:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
as you've heard the other thing that
 
08:19:09.270 --> 08:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
that i want to point out regarding the
 
08:19:11.750 --> 08:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh the the experts that are against any
 
08:19:13.990 --> 08:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
sort of conversion therapy if you go
 
08:19:16.548 --> 08:19:16.558 align:start position:0%
back to the 2007 report of the american
 
08:19:19.270 --> 08:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
psychological association task force a
 
08:19:22.868 --> 08:19:22.878 align:start position:0%
pro an appropriate therapeutic response
 
08:19:24.708 --> 08:19:24.718 align:start position:0%
it didn't demonstrate
 
08:19:27.030 --> 08:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
that sexual orientation change efforts
 
08:19:29.590 --> 08:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
were ineffective or harmful
 
08:19:31.510 --> 08:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
it didn't indicate that it caused
 
08:19:34.070 --> 08:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
suicide it said they couldn't determine
 
08:19:36.468 --> 08:19:36.478 align:start position:0%
whether it could or couldn't and it even
 
08:19:38.308 --> 08:19:38.318 align:start position:0%
went on to say that other individuals
 
08:19:41.190 --> 08:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
reported that so see that sex therapy
 
08:19:43.350 --> 08:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
was helpful for example it helped them
 
08:19:44.868 --> 08:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
to live in a matter consistent with
 
08:19:46.628 --> 08:19:46.638 align:start position:0%
their faith and to give them a chance to
 
08:19:48.468 --> 08:19:48.478 align:start position:0%
be in a community of others
 
08:19:50.708 --> 08:19:50.718 align:start position:0%
the fact that the recommendations of the
 
08:19:52.708 --> 08:19:52.718 align:start position:0%
american psychological association and
 
08:19:55.030 --> 08:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
these other groups
 
08:19:56.788 --> 08:19:56.798 align:start position:0%
point the other way just show how

08:22:35.990 --> 08:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
08:22:38.628 --> 08:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
consider conversion therapy to make it
 
08:22:41.670 --> 08:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
legal is absolutely absurd in my eyes
 
08:22:41.680 --> 08:22:42.868 align:start position:0%
legal is absolutely absurd in my eyes
um

08:22:42.868 --> 08:22:42.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:22:44.788 --> 08:22:44.798 align:start position:0%
i currently attend i currently see two
 
08:22:46.788 --> 08:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
different therapists
 
08:22:49.830 --> 08:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
i saw one prior to the ban on conversion
 
08:22:51.270 --> 08:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
therapy in new hampshire
 
08:22:52.948 --> 08:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
since that went into effect the way she
 
08:22:54.708 --> 08:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
talked to me and the way she discussed
 
08:22:57.510 --> 08:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
my sexuality um and when i brought it up
 
08:22:59.910 --> 08:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
to her did not change at all
 
08:23:02.070 --> 08:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
she let me talk she let me lead the
 
08:23:04.628 --> 08:23:04.638 align:start position:0%
conversation she
 
08:23:06.308 --> 08:23:06.318 align:start position:0%
just followed what i wanted to talk to
 
08:23:07.990 --> 08:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
her about she did not
 
08:23:09.830 --> 08:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
push me to do anything that i did not
 
08:23:13.190 --> 08:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
08:23:13.200 --> 08:23:14.788 align:start position:0%
 
um

08:23:14.788 --> 08:23:14.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:23:16.788 --> 08:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
i would also like to point out that
 
08:23:22.468 --> 08:23:22.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:23:25.350 --> 08:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's known as something else but
 
08:23:27.830 --> 08:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
reputation therapy something like that
 
08:23:30.230 --> 08:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
anyway that means to repair which
 
08:23:32.150 --> 08:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
infers that
 
08:23:33.990 --> 08:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
homosexuality and being transgender is
 
08:23:35.430 --> 08:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
something to be fixed
 
08:23:38.070 --> 08:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
it is not 100 something to be fixed you
 
08:23:39.990 --> 08:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
can go back thousands of years and it's
 
08:23:41.590 --> 08:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
always been something that's been around
 
08:23:42.788 --> 08:23:42.798 align:start position:0%
in the world
 
08:23:44.628 --> 08:23:44.638 align:start position:0%
it's also been recognized in 450
 
08:23:46.468 --> 08:23:46.478 align:start position:0%
different animal species and i would
 
08:23:47.830 --> 08:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
also like to point out that there's only
 
08:23:50.150 --> 08:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
one species that
 
08:23:51.910 --> 08:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
has hate against these these kinds of
 
08:23:54.388 --> 08:23:54.398 align:start position:0%
people and that is the human species
 
08:23:57.750 --> 08:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:24:00.468 --> 08:24:00.478 align:start position:0%
make conversion therapy which
 
08:24:00.478 --> 08:24:01.830 align:start position:0%
make conversion therapy which
yes

08:24:01.830 --> 08:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
08:24:04.308 --> 08:24:04.318 align:start position:0%
there are instances where there it isn't
 
08:24:06.230 --> 08:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
physical or emotional or verbal abuse
 
08:24:08.628 --> 08:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
but i've heard read and seen stories of
 
08:24:11.750 --> 08:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
people being sexually assaulted getting
 
08:24:13.430 --> 08:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
sexually assaulted verbally assaulted
 
08:24:14.788 --> 08:24:14.798 align:start position:0%
emotionally assaulted i've even heard
 
08:24:17.270 --> 08:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
cases of people being raped just to fix
 
08:24:17.280 --> 08:24:18.150 align:start position:0%
cases of people being raped just to fix
them

08:24:18.150 --> 08:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
08:24:20.230 --> 08:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
and that is absolutely
 
08:24:22.868 --> 08:24:22.878 align:start position:0%
insane to me you cannot change it's not
 
08:24:24.388 --> 08:24:24.398 align:start position:0%
something we choose it's something we
 
08:24:25.830 --> 08:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
were born as
 
08:24:25.840 --> 08:24:27.510 align:start position:0%
were born as
and

08:24:27.510 --> 08:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:24:30.788 --> 08:24:30.798 align:start position:0%
to imply that certain people have that
 
08:24:33.350 --> 08:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
certain people can be fixed
 
08:24:36.150 --> 08:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
is absolutely insane thank you
 
08:24:40.708 --> 08:24:40.718 align:start position:0%

08:25:45.430 --> 08:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
i was supported in the moment when i
 
08:25:47.750 --> 08:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
needed to be my parents loved me very
 
08:25:50.308 --> 08:25:50.318 align:start position:0%
much but they did not know uh they did
 
08:25:52.070 --> 08:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
not know that the that conversion
 
08:25:54.708 --> 08:25:54.718 align:start position:0%
therapy was the wrong choice for me and
 
08:25:55.990 --> 08:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
and that and that it was and it was
 
08:25:57.510 --> 08:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
wrong it was only 20 years ago but this
 
08:25:59.750 --> 08:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
was widely understood at the time to be
 
08:26:02.468 --> 08:26:02.478 align:start position:0%
the way you treat people who are lgbtq
 
08:26:05.270 --> 08:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
conservative religious but also other
 
08:26:06.388 --> 08:26:06.398 align:start position:0%
people who weren't conservative or
 
08:26:07.830 --> 08:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
religious thought that the way you
 
08:26:10.308 --> 08:26:10.318 align:start position:0%
treated um people who are who are who
 
08:26:12.708 --> 08:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
are same-sex attracted or transgender
 
08:26:14.308 --> 08:26:14.318 align:start position:0%
was to provide them with conversion
 
08:26:16.388 --> 08:26:16.398 align:start position:0%
therapy to change the way that they felt
 
08:26:18.070 --> 08:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
i've been hearing so many people in this
 
08:26:20.468 --> 08:26:20.478 align:start position:0%
room today saying that this it's wild to
 
08:26:22.230 --> 08:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
think that anyone would want to like
 
08:26:24.150 --> 08:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
coerce someone so people who are really
 
08:26:26.388 --> 08:26:26.398 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill are saying no no
 
08:26:28.388 --> 08:26:28.398 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to coerce anybody to change
 
08:26:29.590 --> 08:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
their sexual orientation or gender
 
08:26:31.750 --> 08:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
identity but that's absolutely false
 
08:26:34.230 --> 08:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
because up until very recently it was
 
08:26:36.388 --> 08:26:36.398 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous treatment for lgbtq people
 
08:26:38.070 --> 08:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
across the country to go through
 
08:26:40.628 --> 08:26:40.638 align:start position:0%
electroshock therapy to go through uh
 
08:26:42.948 --> 08:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
forced viewing of pornography to go
 
08:26:45.910 --> 08:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
through uh lobotomies even it's not that
 
08:26:48.150 --> 08:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
much far in our in our past that this
 
08:26:50.548 --> 08:26:50.558 align:start position:0%
was happening ubiquitously so to hear
 
08:26:52.388 --> 08:26:52.398 align:start position:0%
people today saying like oh nobody
 
08:26:54.150 --> 08:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
believes that or supports that that's
 
08:26:55.510 --> 08:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
great it's great that we've gotten to
 
08:26:57.510 --> 08:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
this overwhelming consensus that that is
 
08:27:00.708 --> 08:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
a debunked um way of treating people but
 
08:27:03.830 --> 08:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
it is not a uniform universal way of
 
08:27:05.350 --> 08:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
thinking and it's not that far in our
 
08:27:07.910 --> 08:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
past okay so when the bill was passed in
 
08:27:10.708 --> 08:27:10.718 align:start position:0%
2018 to ban conversion therapy it was
 
08:27:13.110 --> 08:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
necessary and the circumstances today
 
08:27:15.430 --> 08:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
have not changed there are still people
 
08:27:16.948 --> 08:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
all over the country including in new
 
08:27:18.788 --> 08:27:18.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire who are sending their kids to
 
08:27:20.548 --> 08:27:20.558 align:start position:0%
places where they can get conversion
 
08:27:23.910 --> 08:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
therapy treatment and um and and we need
 
08:27:25.510 --> 08:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it's not possible in
 
08:27:28.150 --> 08:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
as many places as we can and here in new
 
08:27:29.910 --> 08:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire it's been banned you do not
 
08:27:31.590 --> 08:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
want to be one of the one state to go
 
08:27:33.830 --> 08:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
back no state has so far repealed its
 
08:27:35.270 --> 08:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
ban you don't want to be the one state
 
08:27:36.308 --> 08:27:36.318 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
08:27:37.830 --> 08:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you counselor will you take
 
08:27:40.230 --> 08:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
questions i would love to take questions
 
08:27:46.150 --> 08:27:46.160 align:start position:0%

08:28:12.388 --> 08:28:12.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:28:14.788 --> 08:28:14.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
08:28:16.308 --> 08:28:16.318 align:start position:0%
committee for giving me the opportunity
 
08:28:18.868 --> 08:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
to speak here today um originally i came
 
08:28:20.628 --> 08:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
straight from school so forgive me if my
 
08:28:22.788 --> 08:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
words are a little less prepared than
 
08:28:24.788 --> 08:28:24.798 align:start position:0%
other testimonies here today we came
 
08:28:27.670 --> 08:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
straight from work so oh yeah
 
08:28:27.680 --> 08:28:28.788 align:start position:0%
straight from work so oh yeah
but

08:28:28.788 --> 08:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
but
 
08:28:30.948 --> 08:28:30.958 align:start position:0%
i come here to speak today as a
 
08:28:34.070 --> 08:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
concerned peer of lgbt
 
08:28:36.548 --> 08:28:36.558 align:start position:0%
teenagers a teenager myself and most
 
08:28:39.110 --> 08:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
importantly a concerned elder brother of
 
08:28:40.628 --> 08:28:40.638 align:start position:0%
a sibling who is questioning their
 
08:28:42.628 --> 08:28:42.638 align:start position:0%
gender identity
 
08:28:45.350 --> 08:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
looking at the writing of this bill or
 
08:28:47.750 --> 08:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
the law that we're seeking to repeal
 
08:28:50.708 --> 08:28:50.718 align:start position:0%
essentially what i see is that
 
08:28:53.510 --> 08:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
the only therapy allowed in regards to
 
08:28:55.270 --> 08:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
gender identity within the state of new
 
08:28:57.830 --> 08:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire is now affirmation therapy
 
08:28:57.840 --> 08:28:59.190 align:start position:0%
hampshire is now affirmation therapy
which

08:28:59.190 --> 08:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
which
 
08:29:01.750 --> 08:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
when it comes down to it is constantly
 
08:29:03.270 --> 08:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
saying yes and agreeing with a
 
08:29:05.750 --> 08:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
self-diagnosis from a child
 
08:29:07.990 --> 08:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
now at the end of the day i just want to
 
08:29:10.708 --> 08:29:10.718 align:start position:0%
ask the question why it's a question
 
08:29:12.548 --> 08:29:12.558 align:start position:0%
that children ask their parents every
 
08:29:14.548 --> 08:29:14.558 align:start position:0%
day and that now
 
08:29:16.468 --> 08:29:16.478 align:start position:0%
we should open up the opportunity for
 
08:29:18.548 --> 08:29:18.558 align:start position:0%
parents and the children's therapist to
 
08:29:21.030 --> 08:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
ask them why they feel that way with
 
08:29:24.628 --> 08:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
affirmation therapy being the only legal
 
08:29:26.628 --> 08:29:26.638 align:start position:0%
therapy allowed for
 
08:29:26.638 --> 08:29:31.510 align:start position:0%
therapy allowed for
gender

08:29:31.510 --> 08:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:29:33.590 --> 08:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
gender non-conforming kids within the
 
08:29:33.600 --> 08:29:34.948 align:start position:0%
gender non-conforming kids within the
state

08:29:34.948 --> 08:29:34.958 align:start position:0%
state
 
08:29:34.958 --> 08:29:36.070 align:start position:0%
state
essentially

08:29:36.070 --> 08:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
08:29:38.388 --> 08:29:38.398 align:start position:0%
they're no longer allowed to ask why
 
08:29:41.190 --> 08:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
they feel that way and it's something
 
08:29:43.990 --> 08:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
that allows for not as deep a level of
 
08:29:44.000 --> 08:29:44.868 align:start position:0%
that allows for not as deep a level of
care

08:29:44.868 --> 08:29:44.878 align:start position:0%
care
 
08:29:44.878 --> 08:29:46.308 align:start position:0%
care
and

08:29:46.308 --> 08:29:46.318 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:29:49.670 --> 08:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
therapy is some place where people learn
 
08:29:51.910 --> 08:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
to self-reflect and have someone help
 
08:29:54.468 --> 08:29:54.478 align:start position:0%
them through that process of growing and
 
08:29:57.030 --> 08:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
in the wording of the bill or the law it
 
08:29:58.788 --> 08:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
says that
 
08:30:00.948 --> 08:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
therapists are not allowed to attempt to
 
08:30:00.958 --> 08:30:02.388 align:start position:0%
therapists are not allowed to attempt to
change

08:30:02.388 --> 08:30:02.398 align:start position:0%
change
 
08:30:04.830 --> 08:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
a person's gender identity or sexual
 
08:30:07.110 --> 08:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
attractions but the whole point of
 
08:30:07.120 --> 08:30:08.150 align:start position:0%
attractions but the whole point of
therapy

08:30:08.150 --> 08:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
08:30:10.468 --> 08:30:10.478 align:start position:0%
is to change as a person it's to get
 
08:30:12.308 --> 08:30:12.318 align:start position:0%
over fears it's to gain a better
 
08:30:14.388 --> 08:30:14.398 align:start position:0%
understanding of yourself
 
08:30:16.948 --> 08:30:16.958 align:start position:0%
and so i support the repealing of that
 
08:30:19.910 --> 08:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
law and this bill because as someone
 
08:30:21.990 --> 08:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
that has gone through therapy therapists
 
08:30:25.270 --> 08:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
should be able to have the ability to go
 
08:30:28.150 --> 08:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
into a deeper level of self-reflection
 
08:30:30.948 --> 08:30:30.958 align:start position:0%
over the issues that
 
08:30:33.590 --> 08:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
lgbt youth
 
08:30:33.600 --> 08:30:35.750 align:start position:0%

law won't allow for it
 
08:33:40.548 --> 08:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
for example if a christian teen is
 
08:33:42.628 --> 08:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
experiencing feelings that are contrary
 
08:33:44.548 --> 08:33:44.558 align:start position:0%
to their religious beliefs and life
 
08:33:46.468 --> 08:33:46.478 align:start position:0%
goals they might want to talk to a
 
08:33:48.308 --> 08:33:48.318 align:start position:0%
professional to help them work through
 
08:33:50.788 --> 08:33:50.798 align:start position:0%
those issues but under this law they are
 
08:33:54.388 --> 08:33:54.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:33:55.990 --> 08:33:56.000 align:start position:0%

08:34:02.388 --> 08:34:02.398 align:start position:0%
they face are deeply private because of
 
08:34:03.910 --> 08:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
this they do not want to come to a
 
08:34:05.350 --> 08:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
public committee hearing to tell of
 
08:34:08.230 --> 08:34:08.240 align:start position:0%

08:34:26.788 --> 08:34:26.798 align:start position:0%
