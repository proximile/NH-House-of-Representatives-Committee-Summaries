testimony on the board of recount for HP
 
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
463 um HP 463 is a straightforward Bill
 
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
designed to strengthen trust in our
 
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
local election recounts by addressing a
 
00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 align:start position:0%
potential conflict of interest I suspect
 
00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
that many of us have seen the
 
00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 align:start position:0%
professionalism of the state's general
 
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
election recount firsthand efficient
 
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
impartial and well
 
00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
observed but how many of us have been
 
00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
part of a local election recount like
 
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
those for town or School
 
00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 align:start position:0%
ballots here's what this bill hopes to
 
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
improve right now under current law the
 
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
same board members who write up and
 
00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 align:start position:0%
recommend the warrant articles such as
 
00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
school budgets Also Serve on the recount
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
board for those very same articles the
 
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
overlap risks undermining confidence in
 
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
the process even if no one intends any
 
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
harm let me share a quick example during
 
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
a recount that uh representative colum
 
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
petitioned for a School District budget
 
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
article she watched two school board
 
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
members miscount votes by marking them
 
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
in the wrong column honest mistakes
 
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps but they required repeated
 
00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 align:start position:0%
Corrections worst one of those board
 
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
members kept block bling The Observer
 
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
view forcing the teams of observers
 
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
there to double up just to keep things
 
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
transparent so this is not to point
 
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
fingers or suggest bad faith uh I
 
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
believe that most involved in these
 
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
recount processes are good working
 
00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
people working hard for their
 
00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
communities but one shaky recount can
 
00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 align:start position:0%
spoil trust and this seems to be an
 
00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
oversight in the Statue HB 463 offers a
 
00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
simple fix for Town ballot recounts the
 
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
school board and other impartial Fork
 
00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
folks appointed by the moderator shall
 
00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
make up the board of recount for school
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
ballot recounts the select board and
 
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
other neutral appointees make up the
 
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
board of recount no overlap no conflict
 
00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 align:start position:0%
just fairness this isn't about politics
 
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
it's about practicality and protecting
 
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
what we all value A system that works
 
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
well like we all want it to hope this
 
00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
committee will see HB 463 as a small fix
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
and a common sense step to deliver
 
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
confidence in the local recounts that
 
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
occur on occasion thank you for your
 
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 align:start position:0%

representative
 
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
C thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question um what happens if
 
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
there's uh a uh um if the board of
 
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 align:start position:0%
Selectmen are not in the same district
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
as the school board or I should say the
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh School Board encompasses more than
 
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.749 align:start position:0%
uh School Board encompasses more than
one

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
town well the re the it's my
 
00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
understanding that the recount would be
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
in that particular locality and so it
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
would be applicable to that locality and
 
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
then it it's the matter
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
of combining or coating the different re
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
any recount that would occur across the
 
00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 align:start position:0%
different voting Wards so this is for a
 
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
believe are there other questions from
 
00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:43.070 align:start position:0%
believe are there other questions from
the

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
warry I have a uh request to testify
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
from deputy secretary Erin Hennessy
 
00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
the deputy secretary of state and I just
 
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
want to point out I believe the um the
 
00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill or the person who
 
00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:14.759 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill um noted but this
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
would um change the way we do recounts
 
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
right now and would require a select
 
00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:23.879 align:start position:0%
board to take part in a recount of a
 
00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
school board election and a school board
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
to take part in a recount of a select
 
00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:31.639 align:start position:0%
Board election so it's something that is
 
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
not done currently and it um it's
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
something that um I just want to make
 
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
you aware of that um this is what this
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
bill actually does I'm happy to take
 
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%

would this do you feel that this would
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
entail more legislation then what's in
 
00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:01.270 align:start position:0%
entail more legislation then what's in
the

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for the question I think
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
it pro it may I I would have to um
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
discuss this with our legal staff member
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
my concern would be with regards to your
 
00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
earlier question of the sponsor with um
 
00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
School boards that um are across
 
00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
multiple towns and what that makeup
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
would be um and if it would require a
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
member of a school board that's not in
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
the town to conduct a recount of a
 
00:08:31.869 --> 00:08:31.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919 align:start position:0%

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chairman good
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
morning everyone again Erin Hennessy
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state um this bill
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
should have a fiscal note attached to it
 
00:22:48.669 --> 00:22:48.679 align:start position:0%
I don't believe our office was contacted
 
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
but we had a similar Bill last session
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
um I just want to give you a heads up
 
00:22:56.269 --> 00:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
that this because of the amount of time
 
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
that you have to keep ballots uh we
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
would have I believe it would probably
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
cost between $5 and $220,000 a year for
 
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
our office if we wanted to purchase
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
sturdy reusable containers we did do a
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
pilot program um in the general election
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
um with some of these uh containers I
 
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
would say that they are not the ideal
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
container because the bottoms are not
 
00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
flat so we had to put some cardboard in
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
the bottom so that the ballots wouldn't
 
00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
fold um if there was a recount um but I
 
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
I will say that the um the town that did
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
use them um I believe it was sandborn
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
ended up purchasing them for their local
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
elections because they found them easy
 
00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
to use um and um not having to use the
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
red tape they appreciated that um if you
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
were to go down this route I just wanted
 
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
you to make you aware of the fiscal
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
aspect of this and also ask you just to
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
clarify exactly the language that's in
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
in the LA in written in this
 
00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.710 align:start position:0%
in the LA in written in this
legislation

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
um reusable security containers I'm not
 
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
quite sure if you want to describe what
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
you mean by
 
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
security um locking containers is it a
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
container that self loocks or is it a
 
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.750 align:start position:0%
container that self loocks or is it a
lockable

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
lockable
 
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
container um for the serialized
 
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
proprietary sealers our sealers right
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
now are not serialized they are um a
 
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
sticker with our seal on it um that we
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
um do not have serial numbers on WE
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
distribute them to local towns they
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
require the um signatures of the clerk
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
the moderators and the select board
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
members um and that's what makes them um
 
00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
um a security aspect of the seals
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
themselves but they are not um
 
00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
serialized um so I would just like
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
clarification are you looking for
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
serialized ual locks on the containers
 
00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
the containers to be lockable or locking
 
00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:05.870 align:start position:0%
the containers to be lockable or locking
themselves

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
um and the frangible paper seals I'm
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
assuming that means the seals that we're
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
already using um which are um you can
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
whip with a
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
knife and then finally the last part of
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
the bill deals with custody of the
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
boxes right now when the um a recount is
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
requested or if we do an audit of um
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
state election ballots our Secretary of
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
State's office goes to the local town
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
clerk the clerk will put on their uh
 
00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
security log for the boxes that they are
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
signing the boxes out they will not be
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
returning and they're going to the
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
secretary's state Secretary of State's
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
office our office also has a log for the
 
00:25:51.389 --> 00:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
boxes we create where we say this is
 
00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
when we picked it up where we picked it
 
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
up from how many boxes there are and so
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
forth um there is not once we take
 
00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
custody there is that is the log of when
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
we've taken custody there's no other
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
parts of custody of what we do with them
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
and who um and so the um I believe that
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
the last page of this needs some
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
clarification because once we have
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
custody we have custody of it and
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
there's not different times and dates of
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
our custody of the
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
boxes so I'm happy to take questions are
 
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative wood thank you thank you
 
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh you said that this one town tried it
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
do you know how do you remember or know
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
how they locked the boxes sure thank you
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
for the question so it was a um a
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
plastic container um we got red ones for
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
the ballots blue ones for absentee
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
materials very similar to our cardware
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
boxes where we use um and um they kind
 
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
of closed like this and we put the paper
 
00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
sealer over the top and then the um one
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
of the seals that we use for the ACU
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
vote device or the voting Works device
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
um where it has a number on it so they
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
write down on the actual paper sealer
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
the sealer that was used to um lock the
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
container representative your head thank
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um thank you for taking the
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
question in your judgment do you think
 
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
that replacing our current containers
 
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
with the kinds of containers proposed in
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
this bill would improve the security of
 
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
ballots after the
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
vote thank you for the question
 
00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:35.559 align:start position:0%
representative I don't have concerns
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
over the security of the ballots um we
 
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
have had some questions previously where
 
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
others have concerns because um just the
 
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:47.919 align:start position:0%
way the cardboard boxes look um we do
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
request that they reuse ones that we've
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
mailed to them with the ballots in it so
 
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
unless it's a brand new fresh cardboard
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
box that has not been taped before it's
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
not going to look the same as a box that
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
has been reused with the red tape over
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
it and then another new sealer put on
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
top of it so um the appearance I think
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
would be better for some people that
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
don't trust the security but I
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
personally do not have concerns with the
 
00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.870 align:start position:0%
personally do not have concerns with the
current

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
security y follow up from represent
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
actually representative toner's up I
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
apologize representative
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
wood thank you I just had a question of
 
00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
who who has control of the seal tape and
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
um whether it's at the town
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
or at the SOS
 
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
office what of the seal tape this the
 
00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
the security tape or whatever is used to
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
seal the boxes to make sure that like
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
they know if they've been opened or
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
tampered with the red tape yeah okay so
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
right now um the way we suggest uh that
 
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:51.519 align:start position:0%
people seal their boxes is that they um
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
they they seal them with packing
 
00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
tape a strapping tape and a red security
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
tape um we've tested them um and we
 
00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:04.519 align:start position:0%
distribute the red tape out to the local
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
clerks so between our office and the
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
clerks they are the ones with the access
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
to the tape the tape is not um in my
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
opinion um
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
100% it it is very sticky and red stuff
 
00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:21.519 align:start position:0%
can get all over your hands when you're
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
using it but I think that the clerks do
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
a good job using
 
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
it for the represent Lane um thank you
 
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
and thanks for taking my question what
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
does the serialized tape I mean I guess
 
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:37.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with serialized tape
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
and what would it do or enhance to this
 
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
project thank you for the question that
 
00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:44.200 align:start position:0%
was my question as I just want a
 
00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
clarification on what that
 
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
meant representative
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
wey thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary for taking my question
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the paper containers
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
that are or cardboard containers that
 
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
are currently used have you seen
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
incidents where they've uh been stacked
 
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
too high and collapsed or things like
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
that and there's you know um so the
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
question is more is there an inherent
 
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
benefit of having better containers
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
because of the possibility of either
 
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
overtime deterioration or stacking and
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
you have a collapse of the uh boxes
 
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes we have
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
seen in instances where um
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
a a seal a corner of the cardboard has
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
broken because it was dropped or
 
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
something and it doesn't have anything
 
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
to do with the tape um but the Box
 
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:44.200 align:start position:0%
Integrity itself and I think it might
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
have to do with how much recycled papers
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
put into cardboard boxes these
 
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
days uh representative wood thank you Mr
 
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
you said that you saw the you've seen
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
the boxes and they probably haven't
 
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
looked pretty not I'm not trying to put
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
words in your mouth but I'm just trying
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
to figure out that do they look secure
 
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
to you even though we're not looking for
 
00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
pretty but do they look like if someone
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
went in or out you would know it thank
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
you for the question so I haven't seen
 
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
every single box there is but on of the
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
boxes that I have seen at polling
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
locations um when I'm there to observe
 
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
them being sealed or the ones that we do
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
see at recounts I haven't had any
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
personal concerns with them they do look
 
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.909 align:start position:0%
personal concerns with them they do look
sealed

00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
sealed
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
thank representative
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
toner trying to go in order here are you
 
00:31:38.669 --> 00:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
familiar with um the process of securing
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
evidence and chain of um chain of
 
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
custody is that possibly what this is
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
trying to duplicate thank you for the
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
question no I am not pres mhe head thank
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking the
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
question um curious do you know if
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
there's a a standard a common practice
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
among the 49 other states that hold
 
00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:00.519 align:start position:0%
elections the administr elections for
 
00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
for storing ballots are are card
 
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
cardboard boxes the norm are is there a
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
certain type of Ballot Box that everyone
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
else is
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
using thank you um so I did Reach Out
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
multiple times um at to my colleagues
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
across the country on to find out what
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
they use because I am trying to find the
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
perfect container for our ballots
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
without making it too heavy um so that
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
people can pick them up and stack them
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
put them away and store them um there is
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
not I haven't found a standard one um
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
there was stackable containers that were
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
previously used in Maine that may still
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
be used in some main locations that are
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
metal um I don't know that I would
 
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
recommend going to metal it just seems a
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
little dangerous and heavy um but I have
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
not found a standard one so if somebody
 
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
wants to create a business I think that
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
might be a good idea thank you
 
00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
representative Wei thank you Mr chair
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um with
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
regard to the serialized um aspect I
 
00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:06.679 align:start position:0%
think perhaps what the sponsor was
 
00:33:10.509 --> 00:33:10.519 align:start position:0%
trying to get at is can each individual
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
box be specifically identified and is
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
you know how is that uh handled now
 
00:33:18.669 --> 00:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe that would help the
 
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
committee understand the uh that aspect
 
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
bill so I will say that our cardboard
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
boxes are not
 
00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
serialized how it's handled now is that
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
the um the labels on the Box on the
 
00:33:41.549 --> 00:33:41.559 align:start position:0%
paper sealers that we use are supposed
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
to be labeled box one of how many so if
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
there's 20 total boxes for the election
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
um the first one should should be box
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
one of 20 two of 20 and so forth so
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
that's how one would know how many boxes
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
there're supposed to be for that
 
00:33:59.950 --> 00:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
election and then the clerk will put
 
00:34:03.789 --> 00:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
that on her log the boxes that she is or
 
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
he is maintaining in their office
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
securely further questions seeing none I
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
don't have any other pink cards um
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
representative gzowski if you could grab
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
me the blue sheet
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
online this hotly contested
 
00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.389 align:start position:0%
online this hotly contested
Bill

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
hp420 had uh six in support and seven
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
opposed and zero neutral I think we have
 
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
asked more questions than people testify
 
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
online um and then on the blue sheet is
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
blank so having no other pink cards of
 
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:36.919 align:start position:0%
members members of the public wishing to
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%

public hearing on HP 492 and I see the
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Horgan and you
 
00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
that's fine if it's pass around that's
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
okay it won't
 
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
affect all right so uh representative of
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
Horgan when you're ready thank you for
 
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
being here well thank you very much I'm
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
resident Timothy Horgan from straford
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
County District 10 the town of Durham um
 
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
the home University of New Hampshire and
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
actually I'm a former resident for about
 
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
five or six years in in Hanover and I
 
00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
see a bunch of uh I see a group of uh
 
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth students and Dartmouth is a
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
great school I mean it pains me to admit
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
that because I myself went to rival
 
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
School Columbia but um it was a good
 
00:42:02.589 --> 00:42:02.599 align:start position:0%
nature of rivalry now if we had crowd of
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
students from Princeton or Harvard well
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
I guess I would still be glad to see
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
them too but but um so this is HB 492
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's basically uh about recounts when
 
00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
you have wrin after primary where no one
 
00:42:20.549 --> 00:42:20.559 align:start position:0%
has filed to run so um this was we had
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
an incident which happened last year in
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
my County which is straford county um
 
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
well during the state primary on
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
September 10th 2024 so the Republican
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
Party had no candidates for the district
 
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
free county commissioner race and
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
actually there's been a um there have
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
been many bills in this house related to
 
00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:39.800 align:start position:0%
the straford county commissioner
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
districts most of which though happily
 
00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
for you people have been a municipal and
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
County government but anyway nobody
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
filed for the District 3 county
 
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner race and so no one filed
 
00:42:52.349 --> 00:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
during the June filing period no one was
 
00:42:54.549 --> 00:42:54.559 align:start position:0%
chosen to fill the vacant slot on the
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
primary ballot immediately after the
 
00:42:58.349 --> 00:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
filing period which parties can do also
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
like nobody step forward to run a uh
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
right in campaign however a Democrat did
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
get enough W in votes on September 10th
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
2024 this was longtime County
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioner George mcis and he was oo
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
un opposed in his own party's primary
 
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
and um guess the interest of full
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
disclosure I did vote for him and I'm a
 
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
longtime friend of his and anyway he got
 
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
just barely enough votes 35 to be listed
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
on the Republican column in the general
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
election and there only 20 other
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
Republican Wy votes in the September
 
00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
10th primary I think they were all
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
tallied of the sort which they tallied
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
as a as
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
scatter and
 
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
um a document I don't have with have
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
with me but which I could I know where
 
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
if the Secretary of State's office could
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
provide you as the tally sheet from the
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
county from um you know tally sheet from
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
the towns and uh City and there's some
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
City Wards in do and Rochester which are
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
in straford County Comm District three
 
00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
so that um that might be useful piece of
 
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
information because uh the I think the
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
Republicans had some doubt about whether
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
or not they were accurate so they
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
so um I mean I makes I'm satisfied they
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
they were accurate but there um you know
 
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
there those things are written out by
 
00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
hand so sometimes a little bit hard to
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
discern what exactly it is they're
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
saying but so rent Kelly Penza a
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
republican from Rochester on behalf of
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
the straford county Republic committee
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
asked for recap and but she was turned
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
down both by the Secretary of State and
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
the ballot law Commission on the grounds
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
that she had no standing to ask for such
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
a recount since she she did not run for
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
County Commissioner as a writing
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
candidate I guess that would have been
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
legally questionable because she's also
 
00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
a uh ran ran for State Rep and was
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
reelected uh reelected easily but anyway
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
and there was so she wasn't qualified to
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
ask for writing candidate the under the
 
00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
current law the county committee wasn't
 
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
um had no standing and the state
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
committee didn't have any standing in
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
fact there really wasn't anybody who had
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
standing now commissioner mcis if he had
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
hypothetically gotten 34 votes in the
 
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
ini election night count could have
 
00:45:13.549 --> 00:45:13.559 align:start position:0%
asked for a recount and so
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
um I mean like the straford County's
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
County Republican desire for recount was
 
00:45:20.829 --> 00:45:20.839 align:start position:0%
understandable I could probably
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
understand if this had happened to a
 
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
Democrat although I mean of course there
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
were there certainly were several they
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
certainly had several opportunities to
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
you know stop this from happening you
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
know they could have convinced somebody
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
to file they could have named they could
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
have named somebody in June when they
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity they could have also
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
like talked somebody running and writing
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
campaign but they didn't do any of these
 
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
things but still they were their
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
displeasure with the situation was
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
understandable so what this bill does it
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
passed it hence force allows the state
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
party committees to ask for recounts for
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
situations similar to the September 10th
 
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
2024 District 3 county commissioner race
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
and I think there actually have been
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
some recounts of writing candidates in
 
00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
in other races um although although even
 
00:46:10.589 --> 00:46:10.599 align:start position:0%
though commissioner mcgis was not
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
popular with the straford County
 
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
Republican leadership he actually was
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
pretty popular with the voters um
 
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
almost I think what it says my testimony
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
almost 90% of the voters in the County
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
Commission their District voted for them
 
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
so there were about uh 23,000
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
votes for mcis in the November general
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
election and only about 3,000 undervotes
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
so I mean even though he was a very
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
popular candidate with Republicans
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
Democrats and independents the like you
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
I can still see a situ I still see a
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
situ where it might have been
 
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate that let somebody have a
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
recount and so this would allow the
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
state parties to do it and they would
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
pay the usual uh cost cost for recount
 
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
and there's whole procedure in the laws
 
00:46:53.309 --> 00:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
as you probably know better than I
 
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
for estimating the cost and collecting
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
the money from
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
the uh Party Committee so that's um
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
that's my bill I think it's a I think
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly simple change it's uh it's
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan Bill we need a little bit
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
more bipartisanship around here so I
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
urge you to pass it I'd be happy to take
 
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.190 align:start position:0%
urge you to pass it I'd be happy to take
any

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you representative
 
00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative Lane thank
 
00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
you and thanks for taking my question
 
00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:26.119 align:start position:0%
what happens if the person is a um
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
indeep an
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
independent so I guess they wouldn't
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
have been already been on the other on
 
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
the primary ballot if that happened I
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
just I thought of that as you were
 
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
talking but it might not come up I wish
 
00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
I thought of that before I was talking I
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
do know that you have to be registered
 
00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
as a member of a party to file in a in a
 
00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
primary I believe you can actually be
 
00:47:52.349 --> 00:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
nominated in a primary um without being
 
00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
registered in a party and I know there
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
was a uh right in for state senate this
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
last cycle with Michael York who's a
 
00:47:59.710 --> 00:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
state librarian he used to work right
 
00:48:02.109 --> 00:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
across the street from here um until he
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
recently retired so he um he wanted to
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
run as a Democrat for his state senate
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
seat and he was a uh turns out he's a
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
register independent but he did uh file
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
run a writing campaign was successful
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
and was did shown as a Democrat on the
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
ballot I don't don't know specifically
 
00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
whether he changed his party
 
00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
registration during that process so like
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
in there have been cases where
 
00:48:26.109 --> 00:48:26.119 align:start position:0%
Independents have been nominated through
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
a right in and the primary I know um so
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
hope that answers your question as best
 
00:48:33.309 --> 00:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
I can so that might be something you can
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
look at in a work session if you want to
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
have it but are there other questions
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
from the committee oh yes representative
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
Bay thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative Oran for taking my
 
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
question uh I'm curious in this uh your
 
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
your statement where uh you had a
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
hypothetical that had uh commissioner
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
mlar has gotten 34 votes he had a
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
standing to ask for recount what's by
 
00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
what statute is that I don't even I have
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
the print out of the statute here but
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere I believe in RSA 660
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
postelection procedure I believe so I um
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
I sort of have this answer possibly with
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
my fingertips but anyway so that's uh
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a whole law about the
 
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
recount and how depending on how close
 
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
it is like whether you have to pay for
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
it and and so forth I'm probably not the
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
best best person to ask and so
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the deputy secretary of
 
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
state stepped out so she would probably
 
00:49:31.789 --> 00:49:31.799 align:start position:0%
be more like likely to have the answer
 
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
at her fingertips than I do but yes so
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
but people people have asked there have
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
been recounts for in right in primaries
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
before so does happen on occasion
 
00:49:46.109 --> 00:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
so any other question follow followup
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you so uh could you uh
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
just tell us what it says even if you
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
summarize it in your own words like well
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
the rec well depending on how close it
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
is and this applies I think even to a
 
00:50:02.789 --> 00:50:02.799 align:start position:0%
Right End candidate if if you're if
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
within a certain margin that depends on
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
the number of votes in the election you
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
can you don't have to pay a fee I
 
00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
myself had to had to survive a recount
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
in primary to a voter citizen to a rival
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
who is actually you know filed to be in
 
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
the ballot and uh then if it's uh
 
00:50:22.589 --> 00:50:22.599 align:start position:0%
outside of that then you there's a
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
there's a sliding fee scale and then if
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
you're you know if you're totally yeah
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
if then if you're like you know totally
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
outside the parameters then you have to
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
pay for the cost of the recounts you
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
have to pay for all those people to like
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
hang out and do their thing at the uh at
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
the at the state at the state archives
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
all day so which
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of the so the the secretary a
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
lot of the uh people who are actually
 
00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
doing the county are actually paid a
 
00:50:50.109 --> 00:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
token amount to do it so there's some
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
cost to it and secretary state will
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
estimate that and then you can decide
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not you want to go forward
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
with it so usually usually the process
 
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
is very is very very accurate so like so
 
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
there's usually not much point to ask
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
for a recount unless you're within a
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
very few votes of of of either very very
 
00:51:10.109 --> 00:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
few votes of like of of of winning
 
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
there's usually no point in asking for a
 
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
recount but you can if you want it's a
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
little bit different the right and
 
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit more ambiguous
 
00:51:19.789 --> 00:51:19.799 align:start position:0%
because the clerks have to make a
 
00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
judgment on what what constitute a vote
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
for person and what didn't so like I
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
know for example
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh I think with the mlar race or some
 
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
people who it me seems like a pretty
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
simple name it's spelled phonetically
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
and everybody in straford County knows
 
00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
him but I guess there may have been a
 
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
few people who didn't spell his name
 
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
consistently I know I know in the uh
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
first and Nation presidential primary we
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
had like a lot of write him votes for
 
00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
Biden I know like my I for some reason
 
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
decided I should write Joseph R Biden
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
instead of Joe Biden like all the other
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
people in Durham did but they U they
 
00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
decided to count my ballot in the Joe
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
Biden column even though I'd written
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
Joseph R Biden because I knew that was
 
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
the same person
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
but it's kind of hopefully that answered
 
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
your question somewhat longer answer
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
than I probably needed to give but are
 
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
there other questions from the committee
 
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative news thank you
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
very much thanks for taking the question
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh what is the standard of uncertainty
 
00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
is it 30 is that close enough to 35 is
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
40 too many what do you mean by
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
uncertainty um I I don't um actually I
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
don't have the specific number for that
 
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
that's probably uh but it's uh certainly
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of the fee schedule it's by the
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
number of votes that you have so
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
certainly uh you know if you got only if
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
you didn't get any W in votes it would
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
be absurd to write for a re recount if
 
00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:43.799 align:start position:0%
you got say so if you wanted if you had
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
34 votes you would be reasonable to ask
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
for a recount to make sure you in fact
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
maybe picked up another vote that they
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
missed somewhere or also and also you
 
00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
can tell sometimes also you can see by
 
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
the right in sheet some if they wrote
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
down a name that you think should have
 
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
been yours and wasn't yours like uh so
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
actually so say if somebody written like
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know John mcis instead of George
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
mcis you could have George could have
 
00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
like asked to have that counted as for
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
himself so that U that's more of a
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
question for the Secretary of State's
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
office who has and the deputy secretary
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
of state stepped out of the room but I'm
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
sure you can I'm sure you can get an
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
answer to to the question from them so
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
further questions from the
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.150 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
much

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
representative not seeing any other pink
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
cards indicating a desire to testify or
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
anyone appearing to want to
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
testify uh representative gzowski would
 
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
you get the blue sheet please and can
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
you look up the
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
online yeah uh online was 99 SP one
 
00:53:51.760 --> 00:54:01.270 align:start position:0%
online yeah uh online was 99 SP one
opposed

00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
and I see no input on the signup sheet
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
or uh testimony so with that I will
 
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing for HB 492 the
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.359 --> 00:54:55.309 align:start position:0%
 
a.m.

00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:55.319 --> 00:55:25.309 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:55.109 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:55.119 --> 00:58:25.109 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.119 --> 00:58:55.029 align:start position:0%

00:58:55.029 --> 00:58:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.039 --> 00:59:25.029 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.039 --> 00:59:55.029 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:58.510 --> 01:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
okay it's 11:00
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
a.m. so we'll open up the public hearing
 
01:01:05.309 --> 01:01:05.319 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 574 requiring background
 
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
checks of the private companies and
 
01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
their contractors who program and
 
01:01:12.029 --> 01:01:12.039 align:start position:0%
maintain New Hampshire voting machines
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
and we'll recognize our own
 
01:01:15.069 --> 01:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
representative Burnham for the purpose
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
of introduction and without objection
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative Burnham will be allowed
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
to return to her seat to uh conduct her
 
01:01:29.549 --> 01:01:29.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and fellow
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
committee members I am representative
 
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
Claudine bernham representing St
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
representing straford District 2 Milton
 
01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
Rochester w 5 I am introducing HB 574 FN
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
requiring background checks of private
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
companies and their contractors who
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
program and maintain New Hampshire
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
voting machines this is essential to our
 
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
election Integrity Prof process we want
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
to ensure that our ballot counting
 
01:01:59.549 --> 01:01:59.559 align:start position:0%
devices are being maintained and
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
programmed with the utmost security and
 
01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:04.279 align:start position:0%
since the machines are programmed and
 
01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
maintained by company employees it is
 
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
only right to have every person involved
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
in this process to pass a level of
 
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
security with a background check these
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
machines determine the winners of our
 
01:02:17.549 --> 01:02:17.559 align:start position:0%
leaders in our governments and we want
 
01:02:20.349 --> 01:02:20.359 align:start position:0%
to ensure our voters that their machines
 
01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
are processed by vetted
 
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
employees this bill is attached with a
 
01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
note and I'm not sure why since most if
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
not all companies contracted with the
 
01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
government require background checks for
 
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
sensitive roles in National Security and
 
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
since our federal elections are
 
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
conducted on voting machines I believe
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
that would be grounds for National
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
Security even if the state believed they
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
were required to pay for background
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
checks LHS
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
associate employees between 11 to 31
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
employees and voting Works employees
 
01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
between 11 to 50 employees not all
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
employees program and maintain the
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
voting machines either so this number
 
01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
can potentially be much lower the
 
01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
average cost of a comprehensive
 
01:03:09.269 --> 01:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
background check is about
 
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
$50 the most this would cost the state
 
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
is about
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
$4,050 not the $25
 
01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
$500,000 that is estimated in this um in
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
this bill most employees only need one
 
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
background check at the beginning of
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
employment not to be repeated every
 
01:03:31.269 --> 01:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
year and uh and from what I understand
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes the background checks last a
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
few years so there's there's that
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
possibility of reduction of costs even
 
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
um even if it were the projected cost
 
01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:44.039 align:start position:0%
stated in this bill we do also have Hava
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
funds that would certainly be able to
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of the this essential
 
01:03:52.269 --> 01:03:52.279 align:start position:0%
process for voter trust this bill is a
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
common sense bill with transparency
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
security and
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
accountability thank you for your
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
consideration in voting this bill in so
 
01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
our voting machines can be programmed
 
01:04:05.789 --> 01:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
and maintained by verifiable and trusted
 
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
employees of LHS Associates and the
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
voter works thank you questions from the
 
01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
Lane thanks for taking my question I
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
know he had his hand up too I
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
know um
 
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh this is requiring that you you put P
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
information Social Security numbers and
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
information on the the social the
 
01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
secretary's website am I reading that
 
01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
correctly um it requires
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
submission of the state who will then
 
01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
make the information publicly available
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
websites um I'm reading the methodology
 
01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.309 --> 01:05:03.319 align:start position:0%
yeah it's right somebody said line 11 on
 
01:05:03.319 --> 01:05:16.630 align:start position:0%
yeah it's right somebody said line 11 on
page

01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
one um that's not the part that I
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
believe that's been addressed in this
 
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
RSA it's just um
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
01:05:31.269 --> 01:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
know it just sends a list of current
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
employees programming and maintaining
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
electronic can I follow I don't think it
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
has yes follow I think it's the
 
01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
identification number that we're
 
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.470 align:start position:0%
identification number that we're
referring

01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
to and I don't know if that's right
 
01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
employee identification number if that's
 
01:05:49.269 --> 01:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
their social security number or what
 
01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:51.069 align:start position:0%
their social security number or what
that

01:05:51.069 --> 01:05:51.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:58.750 --> 01:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know what that number is
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's um that wasn't in my proposal so
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
to speak but
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't think that that's
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
referring to a soci security number but
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
number further questions from the
 
01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
weary so uh last fall it was discovered
 
01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
in the software code of the machines
 
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
that the Ukrainian national anthem had
 
01:06:34.109 --> 01:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
been programmed in and other cyber
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
security bugs were also found do you
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
the uh background checks might uh
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
prevent this kind of nonsense from
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
occurring in our New Hampshire election
 
01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
programming uh for our ballot
 
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
machines uh I certainly think that's a
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's a possibility I'm I'm not a
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
programmer but um
 
01:06:58.269 --> 01:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
I I would hope that any type of
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
background check would at least start
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
the process of ensuring that security
 
01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:06.029 align:start position:0%
the process of ensuring that security
measure

01:07:06.029 --> 01:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
so uh represent
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
n I'm just sitting where my name tag
 
01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
ended up so thank
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
you um on page two it says that the
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
results of the um background check shall
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
be publicly available are you aware of
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
any other required background checks
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
available I am not I'm not well vers
 
01:07:37.269 --> 01:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
with background checks and what what
 
01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
availability that there is on that
 
01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
so I do not know thank you followup yep
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
follow up um if something comes back as
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
sort of a positive hit does anything in
 
01:07:52.829 --> 01:07:52.839 align:start position:0%
this bill prevent that person from
 
01:07:59.549 --> 01:07:59.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.069 --> 01:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
um not this particular bill I would I
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
would assume that that would be a
 
01:08:10.589 --> 01:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
criminal issue or some type of it would
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
fall under another um law of some sort
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
activity further questions
 
01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.749 align:start position:0%
activity further questions
representative

01:08:22.749 --> 01:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
C thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:08:28.269 --> 01:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
representative taking my question on the
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
page one line u 10 it talks about
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
reports every month does that mean the
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh the company has to uh get a uh
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
Security check on each employee every
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
month what line was that
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't aware that that was actually
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
written that way
 
01:09:13.229 --> 01:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
why further questions from the
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
committee I have one um representative
 
01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
Burnham would you believe that I have to
 
01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
undergo a background check every um 3 to
 
01:09:25.709 --> 01:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
5 years to work in a child career it
 
01:09:25.719 --> 01:09:26.870 align:start position:0%
5 years to work in a child career it
cost

01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
$28 I would believe that cuz I have been
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
involved with um children's ministry and
 
01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
other um an in Town recreation where
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
I've had numerous background checks uh
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
each time that I started and uh once
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
that started it was um acceptable for
 
01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
three years and followup would you also
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
believe that that background check
 
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:48.759 align:start position:0%
includes a digital fingerprinting that's
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
sent through the FBI database yes I
 
01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
would believe that because I have had my
 
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
hands um digitally fingerprinted for
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
that use
 
01:09:58.270 --> 01:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you I don't believe I
 
01:10:03.149 --> 01:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
have any other pink cards so
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
representive gasowski if you could grab
 
01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
me that I thought of a
 
01:10:12.189 --> 01:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
sheet and online 574 had 113 support 11
 
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
opposed and zero
 
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
neutral on the blue sheet it's not blank
 
01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
so I got to look at it thought we're
 
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
we had two people signed up against uh
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
who did not speak having no other
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
members of the public wishing to speak
 
01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 574 I will close the
 
01:10:39.149 --> 01:10:39.159 align:start position:0%

all right we are 11:20 we're going to

open the public hearing on House Bill
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
497 requiring the periodic evaluation of
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
the forms and procedures related to
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
performing voter checklist duties and we
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
will recognize our own representative
 
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
Wei for the purpose of introduction
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members my name is
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
Robert Wy I have the privilege of
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
representing the great town of Hudson
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District
 
01:21:44.189 --> 01:21:44.199 align:start position:0%
13 um this bill is a simple Bill and it
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
really uh proposes sort of a pilot um
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
type of study
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
whereby the Secretary of State's office
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
would periodic ially evaluate the forms
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
and procedures for usability and
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
determine resource and time requirements
 
01:22:03.310 --> 01:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
for the completions of forms and the
 
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
performance of the procedures um in
 
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
reviewing the rsas there's very few
 
01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
places that talk about how the forms
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
and other procedures that are used by
 
01:22:21.149 --> 01:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
our election officials are handled by
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State in uh RSA 65 5222
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
for the election manual it does say
 
01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
something to the effect of or let me
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
quote exactly the manual shall be
 
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
written in non-technical language so
 
01:22:37.149 --> 01:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
that's the only place really that I've
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
sort of found where there's a uh
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
prescription for how procedures and
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
forms are to be written and the thought
 
01:22:46.709 --> 01:22:46.719 align:start position:0%
was there there is this science called
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
human factors engineering it's used a
 
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
lot in the medical device industry which
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
I'm very familiar with and the uh aspect
 
01:22:58.590 --> 01:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
to it um is that basically anything that
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
is potentially complicated should be
 
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
evaluated carefully and determine that
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
the people who would be normally tasked
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
with with performing those Duties are
 
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
um uh provided procedures and forms that
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
evaluate their ability to use those
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
forms and and that they can be used
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
without too much
 
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
complexity and uh any loss of
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
proficiency in handling their those
 
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
procedures so the idea behind this bill
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
is very simple you just uh allow the
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to periodically
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
evaluate the forms uh of use uh for
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
usability uh I started really with the
 
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
checklist procedures because this is uh
 
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
maintaining the voter roles to me is one
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
of the cornerstones to election
 
01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
integrity and also so we know from uh
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
the experiences in the last general
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
election that there were extremely long
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
lines due to same day registration in
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
some areas so it's it would seem to make
 
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
sense that this could be an area that
 
01:24:11.470 --> 01:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
could at least uh be evaluated so that
 
01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:15.719 align:start position:0%
is the essence of this um I'll happy to
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
take any questions if there are
 
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
any are questions from the
 
01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
committee oh there
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
are okay representative we'll just go
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
left to right start representative
 
01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
Bay thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um when you say uh
 
01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
periodically do you have a notion of the
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
period because you know we can go to
 
01:24:42.189 --> 01:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
extremes of really short or really long
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
I mean such that you know every 10 years
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
is a period every day is is periodic so
 
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
what what's what's what are you thinking
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
about ideally I think um
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
most often usability just speaking from
 
01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:01.639 align:start position:0%
medical device experience um most often
 
01:25:05.229 --> 01:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
usability is a big initial evaluation
 
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
and then it's minor periodic reviews
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
that occur typically with updates to
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
procedure so if we had a change in the
 
01:25:17.709 --> 01:25:17.719 align:start position:0%
law then there would be an evaluation of
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
of the usability and how that is impact
 
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh or how the procedures and forms are
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
impacted by a change to the RSA so
 
01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:28.470 align:start position:0%
impacted by a change to the RSA so
that's

01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
the um that's the kind of nature of how
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's done in at least other Industries
 
01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
so I would expect the periodic is based
 
01:25:41.109 --> 01:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
mostly upon RSA changes but it you know
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
on occasion it might be a a multi-year
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
cycle so three to five years could could
 
01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
be also another standard that could be
 
01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
used in that
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
case uh representative Gilmore
 
01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:55.590 align:start position:0%
case uh representative Gilmore
thank

01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
you I I was it's pretty much the same
 
01:25:59.870 --> 01:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
question but I'm actually looking for a
 
01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
definition of periodic if that could be
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
possible and something to think about in
 
01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
terms of because again I'm up in the air
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
what what it means and you you explained
 
01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
something you know just prior to this
 
01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
and um maybe if you could put it in
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
writing in some manner that would be I I
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
because I don't know how um excuse me I
 
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
don't know how the Secretary of State or
 
01:26:25.229 --> 01:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
other people would interpret it
 
01:26:26.669 --> 01:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
so I think there should be greater
 
01:26:29.229 --> 01:26:29.239 align:start position:0%
Clarity if that's
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
possible I uh thank you for your
 
01:26:31.679 --> 01:26:33.350 align:start position:0%
possible I uh thank you for your
question

01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
um I I think it it could be perhaps
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
amended to something along the lines of
 
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh evaluated at least every five years
 
01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
or sooner if necessitated By changes to
 
01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:46.709 align:start position:0%
or sooner if necessitated By changes to
the

01:26:46.709 --> 01:26:46.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
suitable we're going around the table so
 
01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
yeah um we got to go to well we'll go
 
01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:56.830 align:start position:0%
yeah um we got to go to well we'll go
representative

01:26:56.830 --> 01:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
new thank you very much um thanks for
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
taking the question uh do you know what
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
the secretary state's office does now
 
01:27:06.189 --> 01:27:06.199 align:start position:0%
even though it's not in a sha language
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
like your proposal but are they
 
01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
reviewing the forms and procedures at
 
01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:12.030 align:start position:0%
reviewing the forms and procedures at
this

01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
point I I would say certainly that there
 
01:27:20.109 --> 01:27:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.669 --> 01:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
not just in in
 
01:27:24.679 --> 01:27:25.790 align:start position:0%
not just in in
basic

01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
basic
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
discussions um not perhaps specifically
 
01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
about this bill but in basic discussions
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
there is no one who
 
01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.669 align:start position:0%
there is no one who
has

01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
um uh human factors engineering
 
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
background or a uh another parallel
 
01:27:44.189 --> 01:27:44.199 align:start position:0%
thing to this would be industrial
 
01:27:48.590 --> 01:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
psychology um so there is no one who has
 
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
sort of that background to my
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
understanding reviewing these forms and
 
01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:59.790 --> 01:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
representative Ward oh oh he got you
 
01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:01.719 align:start position:0%
okay uh further questions from the
 
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none I don't have any
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative weary I
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
don't have any pink
 
01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
cards um so representative gaski if you
 
01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
could grab the blue sheet and online we
 
01:28:17.629 --> 01:28:17.639 align:start position:0%
had I don't know why I clicked off of it
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.430 --> 01:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
blank uh okay we'll grab it um and then
 
01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:37.790 align:start position:0%
blank uh okay we'll grab it um and then
497

01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
497
 
01:28:40.109 --> 01:28:40.119 align:start position:0%
was where's the
 
01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
summary hold on let me Let me refresh it
 
01:28:45.149 --> 01:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not a hotly contested bill
 
01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
but I want to read the they're not
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
showing the summer anymore which kind of
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
sucks um it it was like split but it was
 
01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
like seven and eight it was I can't
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
count it up without the summary so my
 
01:28:58.350 --> 01:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
apologies I don't know why the summary
 
01:28:59.910 --> 01:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
is not working all right with that we
 
01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:01.719 align:start position:0%
will close the public hearing on House
 
01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 597 and we will stand in recess
 
01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:08.430 align:start position:0%
Bill 597 and we will stand in recess
until

01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:12.510 --> 01:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
11:40 Mr chair um my on my computer it
 
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
says it was four and support nine
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
opposed on the summary for that for
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:51.040 --> 01:30:22.950 align:start position:0%

it is 11:40 and it's time to open the
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HP 514 FN this public
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
hearing is now opened I recognize
 
01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
representative Barry to introduce the
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
bill he has sponsored thank you um yes
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh my name is representative rosb
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
represent we the towns of wear in gtown
 
01:41:18.589 --> 01:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce 514 allowing
 
01:41:20.189 --> 01:41:20.199 align:start position:0%
private person Su violations of election
 
01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
law um so this came about in a lawsuit
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
that I filed uh with a state senator uh
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
in regards to what we viewed as an abuse
 
01:41:31.149 --> 01:41:31.159 align:start position:0%
of R uh in one of the sections of RC 659
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
and the last Clause of RSA 659 mentions
 
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General um and the
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement procedures for the entire
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
chapter and what the court the court
 
01:41:45.149 --> 01:41:45.159 align:start position:0%
took the position that only the Attorney
 
01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
General can um can uh basically
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
adjudicate something can adjudicate a
 
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
violation of 659 so if the if the
 
01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office the Department
 
01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
of Justice deems that there's no
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
violation you as a private individual
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
have no recourse uh for any part of the
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
chapter which is actually really
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
dangerous um so the first thing is is I
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
believe you have a right um as a citizen
 
01:42:12.750 --> 01:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
to seek redress from your government and
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
one person should not be able to
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not you get to seek
 
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
redress and there's all sorts of things
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:42:22.109 --> 01:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
659 that both sides of the aisle should
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
be interested in the potential to be
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
able to file a lawsuit in court over um
 
01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
for instance if you are denied the right
 
01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
to vote and the court takes the position
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
that only the doj can um a can can
 
01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:38.360 align:start position:0%
pursue a violation of 659 and they take
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
Court takes that position you're done
 
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's it you don't get to vote um in my
 
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
case I was suing over an electioneering
 
01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
issue which is also under 659 but 659
 
01:42:48.589 --> 01:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
handles election procedures so if you
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
see something that's a gross abuse of
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
the process uh and the doj disagrees
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
with you one person the doj disagrees
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
with you it's over for you you don't get
 
01:42:59.070 --> 01:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
to seek redress so this is an attempt to
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
allow uh private individuals if they
 
01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
don't believe they've had their concerns
 
01:43:07.149 --> 01:43:07.159 align:start position:0%
redressed by the doj to bring a lawsuit
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
into court uh it does have in there some
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity uh protections at the
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
very last section um to so we don't have
 
01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
that kind of chilling effect on suing a
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
person on the personal level um but that
 
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
is the intent of the law that is the it
 
01:43:25.629 --> 01:43:25.639 align:start position:0%
also has a provision I should say it has
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
a provision about um if you suspect that
 
01:43:31.390 --> 01:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
RSA 659 is being violated the first
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
thing you have to do is go to the doj uh
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
and the doj has five days to say hey
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
yeah something's wrong here something's
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
not wrong here the exception being is if
 
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
with you're if you're within two weeks
 
01:43:44.350 --> 01:43:44.360 align:start position:0%
of an election so 15 days of an election
 
01:43:46.589 --> 01:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
uh and then you can go straight to court
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
um because obviously if they're delaying
 
01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
the doj is delaying you should be able
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
to seek redress because the immedate of
 
01:43:54.910 --> 01:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
the matter requires you to go around
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
them but so I try to create a framework
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
of first you got to go to the doj if
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
you're really close to the an election
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
or on Election Day and you see
 
01:44:04.270 --> 01:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
something's going on that's wrong um you
 
01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
should be able to go to court and seek
 
01:44:09.229 --> 01:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
redress um so with that I'm happy to
 
01:44:09.239 --> 01:44:10.070 align:start position:0%
redress um so with that I'm happy to
take

01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
questions oh thank you are there
 
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:44:16.629 --> 01:44:16.639 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
C uh thank you um Mr chairman and thank
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
you for representive for taking my
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
question for sure I call you chairman
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
I'm representative right now although I
 
01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
I may try to do the thing where I you
 
01:44:31.390 --> 01:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
know say who person the
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh does does this mean that you have to
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
go to the doj first and only if they
 
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
deny you that then you have standing to
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
go to court no uh so you have to go to
 
01:44:45.310 --> 01:44:45.320 align:start position:0%
the doj first and let them attempt to
 
01:44:47.310 --> 01:44:47.320 align:start position:0%
act right because they may solve your
 
01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:49.159 align:start position:0%
problem right the doj may solve your
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
problem and then you don't need to go to
 
01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
court um so that that's the intention is
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
you got to go you go with the exception
 
01:44:56.910 --> 01:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
of the two-e window um you got to go to
 
01:44:58.870 --> 01:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
the doj first which is the procedure now
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
at least as what the courts have said um
 
01:45:03.589 --> 01:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
but if you don't like what they do or
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
they say there's not a problem or they
 
01:45:06.990 --> 01:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
say they're not going to act on it um
 
01:45:09.550 --> 01:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
and you feel that you're being violated
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
um you're being you're suffering harm
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
then you get to go through the court
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
system and this includes things like
 
01:45:18.990 --> 01:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
registering to vote if your moderator
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
denies you a ballot um and you feel that
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
you should be able to ballot they won't
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
let you out um you know a challenge
 
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
voter affidavit or something like that
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of relief mechanism that we've
 
01:45:29.070 --> 01:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
built in that may or may not be there
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
anymore um but this this allows you to
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
kind of seek relief through the judicial
 
01:45:37.390 --> 01:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
system which you're supposed to be able
 
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
to do you're supposed to be able to seek
 
01:45:40.750 --> 01:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
relief through the Judiciary um and for
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
some reason the Judiciary has recited
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
that no you don't get to do that because
 
01:45:47.070 --> 01:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
of the very last line in RSA 659 which
 
01:45:48.990 --> 01:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
they have interpreted it says only the
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
doj the Attorney General um can push
 
01:45:55.709 --> 01:45:55.719 align:start position:0%
claims of RSA 659 through the
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
courts thank you are there other
 
01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee I I see
 
01:46:01.390 --> 01:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
there are uh representative Mirad first
 
01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um at I'm trying to
 
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
figure out at uh
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
present you you mentioned that there's a
 
01:46:12.750 --> 01:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
there there's something in 659 about how
 
01:46:14.830 --> 01:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
the provisions of election procedure are
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
enforced or how violations are I guess
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
um prosecuted and I haven't been able to
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
find that it's the very last very last
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
section um and it mentions the Attorney
 
01:46:27.189 --> 01:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
General's office you'll see it's I think
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's the second it's the last I don't
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
have it in front of me but it's the last
 
01:46:33.790 --> 01:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
uh it's the last little section it's I
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
think it's section A I think there's a
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
two-part section A and B and I believe a
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
is the one that mentions the doj or the
 
01:46:41.070 --> 01:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office I don't have
 
01:46:43.709 --> 01:46:43.719 align:start position:0%
it in front of me um but it's in there
 
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
and the courts have interpreted that as
 
01:46:47.470 --> 01:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
being only the doj can pursue the
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
violations of
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
659 representative wood do you still
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
01:46:56.430 --> 01:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
I do thank you for taking my question
 
01:47:00.189 --> 01:47:00.199 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that um the you had a
 
01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:03.719 align:start position:0%
personal problem along these lines um
 
01:47:05.310 --> 01:47:05.320 align:start position:0%
the way the law was written was it
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
intended to be that way from your
 
01:47:10.189 --> 01:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
understanding about uh basically they
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
being the last um last stop as far as a
 
01:47:16.109 --> 01:47:16.119 align:start position:0%
result I I don't know I haven't I
 
01:47:18.589 --> 01:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
haven't looked into it um I
 
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
it the answer is I don't know my my full
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
response would be I don't care um
 
01:47:25.750 --> 01:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
because I believe at my core you have a
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
you have a right to go to court uh you
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
have a right to do that and you have a
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
right to seek redress through your
 
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
government and I fully reject the idea
 
01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
that one person um the Attorney General
 
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
gets to make a determination and that's
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
the end of it and you can you can suffer
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
abuse and you could see how that and I'm
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
not claiming you know I obviously with
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
my particular case I disagreed with what
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
the doj's determination was I wasn't
 
01:47:50.350 --> 01:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
quiet about that and I still disagree
 
01:47:52.669 --> 01:47:52.679 align:start position:0%
with their determination on it um but
 
01:47:53.790 --> 01:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
when when I when I went to go seek
 
01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
redress to the court um I was not I was
 
01:47:58.470 --> 01:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
I was able to make my case to the court
 
01:47:59.790 --> 01:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
but the court ultimately said it doesn't
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
matter if your case it doesn't matter if
 
01:48:03.870 --> 01:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
the judge agreed with me or not only the
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
doj gets to make this determination
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
because of the language that's in RSA
 
01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
659 in the last
 
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
section thank you and I just disagree
 
01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
with that premise I just I and that
 
01:48:15.070 --> 01:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
could happen at any point in that
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
section so there's stuff in there that
 
01:48:18.189 --> 01:48:18.199 align:start position:0%
my friends on the right like there's
 
01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
stuff in there that my friends on the
 
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
left like one person could get in there
 
01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
and just be like no I'm not enfor that
 
01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
today or they could do disproportionate
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement and you would be there
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
nothing you could do about
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
committee okay uh representative
 
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
Lane representative Lane go ahead please
 
01:48:41.870 --> 01:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh thanks for taking my question sorry
 
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
um I was looking at the attorney's fees
 
01:48:48.669 --> 01:48:48.679 align:start position:0%
section yeah um and it's on page
 
01:48:53.470 --> 01:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
two um it it says that no attorney
 
01:48:55.589 --> 01:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
representative shall charge or collect
 
01:48:58.109 --> 01:48:58.119 align:start position:0%
fees for legal services rendered unless
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
the fees have been approved by the
 
01:49:02.290 --> 01:49:02.300 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:04.270 align:start position:0%
superior court
[Music]

01:49:04.270 --> 01:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
so how do you then get hire an attorney
 
01:49:10.350 --> 01:49:10.360 align:start position:0%
to get you into
 
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
court before they've had their fees
 
01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:17.800 align:start position:0%
approved yeah uh I mean my goal here so
 
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
the answer is you can't right that's
 
01:49:20.830 --> 01:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
built in the law intentionally I don't
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
want this to be a cash grab I I want
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
want this to be a there's harm being
 
01:49:27.790 --> 01:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
there's harm that is occurring and you
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
you as a private individual need to be
 
01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
able to go you can as you know
 
01:49:31.629 --> 01:49:31.639 align:start position:0%
representative Lane you're an attorney
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
you can file prosay in New Hampshire
 
01:49:35.790 --> 01:49:35.800 align:start position:0%
Court um and if you think you have a
 
01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
good argument you can make it but no you
 
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
can't we're not going to be sitting here
 
01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
patting up the pockets of attorneys um
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
and because you can imagine there's a
 
01:49:44.589 --> 01:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
lot happening at 659 there's a lot of
 
01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
moving pieces there um and things happen
 
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
by accident some things happen by
 
01:49:50.189 --> 01:49:50.199 align:start position:0%
accident some things happen by intention
 
01:49:52.350 --> 01:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
right um and that's why we have the
 
01:49:54.870 --> 01:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
release valve at the very end um for
 
01:49:56.589 --> 01:49:56.599 align:start position:0%
things that are accidents are not a big
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
deal um but I don't want I don't want to
 
01:50:03.870 --> 01:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
open up a Floodgate Of lawsuits um and I
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
don't want inter attorneys encouraging
 
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
said lawsuits because they think that
 
01:50:09.390 --> 01:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
it's a Payday coming I want you be able
 
01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
to seek red address through the judicial
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
system which I once again I go back to
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:18.510 --> 01:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
right I'm going to proceed with
 
01:50:19.990 --> 01:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative Mirad first and then you
 
01:50:24.669 --> 01:50:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I'm also trying to
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
just ascertain the nature of the
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that would be filed so this
 
01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
these are civil suits there are
 
01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
individuals being harmed by a violation
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
of election procedure um are they
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
charging the state with harming them so
 
01:50:43.950 --> 01:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
the state would be the defendant in
 
01:50:46.709 --> 01:50:46.719 align:start position:0%
every in every case um or are they
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
charging individuals um who are working
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
in the polls with violating with harming
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
them uh so there is a section I believe
 
01:50:58.910 --> 01:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's first page um I believe there is a
 
01:51:00.270 --> 01:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
section of that excuse me let me let me
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
find it here we go it's uh second page
 
01:51:05.950 --> 01:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
uh line 12 claims filed against state
 
01:51:07.470 --> 01:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
and its agent that goes into the details
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
of that um and what that talks about
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
there is basically the the state the
 
01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
state is the first kind of person um but
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
if you try to go after that person on
 
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
individual level um it's very easy for
 
01:51:20.350 --> 01:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
them to drop off um I I don't know if I
 
01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
answered that question well um but that
 
01:51:25.709 --> 01:51:25.719 align:start position:0%
that sex the language in there to answer
 
01:51:28.510 --> 01:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
that is in this bill um
 
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
that we're not I I don't want to set up
 
01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
a system where people are trying to sue
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
their moderator they're trying to sue
 
01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
their selectman I don't want to set that
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
system up um I want to set up a system
 
01:51:40.510 --> 01:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
where if you're being harmed you can
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
seek redress and one person is not the
 
01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
gatekeeper to your to your ability to
 
01:51:48.069 --> 01:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
fix a
 
01:51:49.950 --> 01:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
problem tried to put a lot of I try to
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
put a lot of restraints on it
 
01:51:55.629 --> 01:51:55.639 align:start position:0%
representative Lane you had a
 
01:51:58.229 --> 01:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
followup um it's my understanding and I
 
01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
don't know this about Superior Court but
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
um in a lot of the courts and I've been
 
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
practicing for a while but 50% of the
 
01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
suits are
 
01:52:10.510 --> 01:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
prosay um and actually prosay people
 
01:52:17.149 --> 01:52:17.159 align:start position:0%
tend to um uh the cases take longer so
 
01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
my concern is that you are opening the
 
01:52:21.870 --> 01:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
floodgates for anybody who's not happy
 
01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
to file this this prosay because they
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:30.910 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:34.350 --> 01:52:34.360 align:start position:0%
the so prosay is I I
 
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
think you but you don't agree with that
 
01:52:40.270 --> 01:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
you don't think having it prosay is
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
gonna increase the number of lawsuits I
 
01:52:45.790 --> 01:52:45.800 align:start position:0%
I I would never I would never take the
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
position that someone should not be able
 
01:52:49.629 --> 01:52:49.639 align:start position:0%
to file pray because I I believe at my
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
court anybody should be able to go to
 
01:52:53.669 --> 01:52:53.679 align:start position:0%
the court and seek redress um and as to
 
01:52:56.910 --> 01:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
the immediacy of it that's that's just
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
kind of one of those problems with an
 
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
election right it has a defined Point as
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
a Define Point has to happen um and I
 
01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
remembered I forgot to answer part of
 
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
Representative mir's question so I want
 
01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
to okay go back to he asked what type of
 
01:53:10.069 --> 01:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
Suits would be filed we're talking about
 
01:53:13.069 --> 01:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
TR temporary restraining orders um uh
 
01:53:15.669 --> 01:53:15.679 align:start position:0%
injunctions that sort of stuff to seek
 
01:53:18.550 --> 01:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
to seek relief from the
 
01:53:20.669 --> 01:53:20.679 align:start position:0%
court know if if somebody's telling you
 
01:53:22.589 --> 01:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
you can't vote and you believe that you
 
01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
can vote and you should be able to go to
 
01:53:26.910 --> 01:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
a court and if a court says yes this
 
01:53:29.069 --> 01:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
person can vote the Court's going to
 
01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
issue a court order for you to go vote
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I have one more followup yes go
 
01:53:36.910 --> 01:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
ahead please it kind of pings off of uh
 
01:53:39.629 --> 01:53:39.639 align:start position:0%
representative Mirad in that situation
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
where you denied the right to
 
01:53:45.629 --> 01:53:45.639 align:start position:0%
vote would you be suing the city or the
 
01:53:47.790 --> 01:53:47.800 align:start position:0%
town or the Secretary of State because
 
01:53:49.470 --> 01:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
the people that are denying you the
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
right to vote are actually the town or
 
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
the city not the secretary of state so
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
you in that case you would go after the
 
01:53:58.510 --> 01:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
the Town M because they're the ones
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
administering the
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
election you have to be able to go after
 
01:54:03.950 --> 01:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
the person who's doing or the person the
 
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
The Entity that's doing the harm
 
01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:10.719 align:start position:0%
right representative wry thank you Mr
 
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
chair um and thank you for taking my
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
question I just I'm I'm trying to kind
 
01:54:18.550 --> 01:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
of summarize this so it's a fundamental
 
01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
right to petition the government for a
 
01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
redress of grievances in your particular
 
01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
situation you had an unelected official
 
01:54:30.629 --> 01:54:30.639 align:start position:0%
stop your ability to
 
01:54:34.669 --> 01:54:34.679 align:start position:0%
redress your grievances because they
 
01:54:38.069 --> 01:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
basically said no we're not acting on it
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
the courts then interpreted that as lack
 
01:54:42.350 --> 01:54:42.360 align:start position:0%
of standing and would not act on it
 
01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:43.870 align:start position:0%
of standing and would not act on it
correct

01:54:43.870 --> 01:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:54:49.149 --> 01:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
of enabling
 
01:54:56.709 --> 01:54:56.719 align:start position:0%
standing in the ca where elected
 
01:54:59.390 --> 01:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
officials are more responsible is am I
 
01:55:01.990 --> 01:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
mistaking that or you're you're enabling
 
01:55:04.109 --> 01:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
standing to go in front of the court and
 
01:55:05.310 --> 01:55:05.320 align:start position:0%
plead your
 
01:55:07.589 --> 01:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
case because they to in my particular
 
01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:09.679 align:start position:0%
case they tossed out they tossed out my
 
01:55:11.589 --> 01:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
case due to standing and it's not it's
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
not about my particular case because
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
I've already solved my issue um with
 
01:55:17.069 --> 01:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
that with that legislation my issue is
 
01:55:19.229 --> 01:55:19.239 align:start position:0%
is if there's other when I when they
 
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
took when the court took that position
 
01:55:24.030 --> 01:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
it scared me because now there's a
 
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
gatekeeper for justice and we have a
 
01:55:27.629 --> 01:55:27.639 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice there's a reason
 
01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
for it but if your rights are being
 
01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
violated you should be able to go to the
 
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
courts and have those issues addressed
 
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
in a court of law which has always been
 
01:55:39.629 --> 01:55:39.639 align:start position:0%
a fundamental First Amendment first it's
 
01:55:41.589 --> 01:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
it's a fundamental part of our process
 
01:55:43.709 --> 01:55:43.719 align:start position:0%
you have a right to seek redress um and
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
I just don't like the idea of a singular
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
person being able to say no to that you
 
01:55:51.069 --> 01:55:51.079 align:start position:0%
should be able to go through the court
 
01:55:53.709 --> 01:55:53.719 align:start position:0%
system it's why the court exists um they
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
are reason why we have three bodies um
 
01:55:58.270 --> 01:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
and I I just don't think one person in
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
the executive branch telling you no
 
01:56:02.430 --> 01:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
should be the reason why you just have
 
01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:04.030 align:start position:0%
should be the reason why you just have
to

01:56:04.030 --> 01:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:06.069 --> 01:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
stop are there further questions from
 
01:56:08.310 --> 01:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Mirad thank
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I wanted to just return to
 
01:56:12.750 --> 01:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
that attorney's fee section lines 25 and
 
01:56:14.589 --> 01:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
following on page
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
two um and I just wonder about like this
 
01:56:19.950 --> 01:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
sort of hypothetical suppose that I
 
01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0%
think I've been harmed because election
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
procedure hasn't been
 
01:56:28.229 --> 01:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
followed and uh and I and I being a
 
01:56:30.669 --> 01:56:30.679 align:start position:0%
lawyer snob go out and hire an attorney
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
who charges $750 an hour and get that
 
01:56:36.430 --> 01:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
attorney to help me compose a complaint
 
01:56:38.990 --> 01:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
and file it um with Attorney General's
 
01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
office and then file in Superior Court
 
01:56:42.589 --> 01:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
would that contract that I've that
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
private contract that I've entered into
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
with this attorney would that contract
 
01:56:49.629 --> 01:56:49.639 align:start position:0%
be null and void as a consequence of
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
this section yeah that's a great
 
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
question I don't have an answer answer
 
01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
to it um and the more broader point is
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not dying on the hill of attorney
 
01:56:59.430 --> 01:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
fees I just don't want I'm trying to
 
01:57:01.109 --> 01:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
avoid the situation of attorneys
 
01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
actively encouraging these suits versus
 
01:57:05.390 --> 01:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
a private individual trying to move
 
01:57:08.189 --> 01:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
forward on their own um but I said it's
 
01:57:09.790 --> 01:57:09.800 align:start position:0%
not it's not the hill that I'm dying on
 
01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just I was trying to when I crafted
 
01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
this I tried to go in and build the
 
01:57:16.510 --> 01:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
build the safeguards and stop abuse in
 
01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
advance understanding that we are
 
01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
opening the
 
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
gates are there further question from
 
01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:25.390 align:start position:0%
gates are there further question from
the

01:57:25.390 --> 01:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
committee representative Lane well at
 
01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
least you know I read
 
01:57:35.069 --> 01:57:35.079 align:start position:0%
it um thanks for taking the question in
 
01:57:36.910 --> 01:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
one of the and it comes back to the
 
01:57:38.709 --> 01:57:38.719 align:start position:0%
question I had about whether you see the
 
01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
city or the state um in one of these
 
01:57:44.189 --> 01:57:44.199 align:start position:0%
sections the new sections D colon 4 it
 
01:57:47.069 --> 01:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
says files claimed against the state and
 
01:57:49.870 --> 01:57:49.880 align:start position:0%
its agent but there's not a
 
01:57:53.550 --> 01:57:53.560 align:start position:0%
similar um it so if you're bringing it
 
01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
against the city would that fall under
 
01:57:58.709 --> 01:57:58.719 align:start position:0%
D5 so I'm just making sure it didn't IM
 
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
get left out so it's on line 12 page two
 
01:58:03.790 --> 01:58:03.800 align:start position:0%
and then line
 
01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
18 so to your point I mean D5 says lines
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
19 and 20 says against another party I
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
would I would assume that that would I I
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
would interpret that as meaning the
 
01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
towns I certainly mean it I certainly do
 
01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
mean it to so if you're asking what my
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
intent is yes but I I believe that
 
01:58:20.910 --> 01:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
covers it um once again I'm not I'm I'm
 
01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
not a uh I'm definitely open to changes
 
01:58:24.750 --> 01:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
it's not a it's not a my way or the
 
01:58:28.030 --> 01:58:28.040 align:start position:0%
highway on the bill but all right thank
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the
 
01:58:32.990 --> 01:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
01:58:35.310 --> 01:58:35.320 align:start position:0%
much representative for your
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
testimony I have uh one individual who's
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh requested to testify representative
 
01:58:42.910 --> 01:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
forgan thank you very much for being
 
01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
recognized well we'll uh leave it it
 
01:58:54.149 --> 01:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
where he left it and he'll hopefully be
 
01:58:56.109 --> 01:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
able to find it
 
01:58:58.830 --> 01:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
easily right he's like me he has the
 
01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
ringer turned off all the time so okay
 
01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
well thank you please if you want to
 
01:59:02.910 --> 01:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
reach me on the phone you have to leave
 
01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
me a Google voicemail but anyway so I'm
 
01:59:06.910 --> 01:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
represent Timothy Horgan straford County
 
01:59:09.069 --> 01:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
District 10 which is the town of Durham
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
and um I just feel this I think this
 
01:59:15.629 --> 01:59:15.639 align:start position:0%
bill goes goes way too way too far well
 
01:59:17.310 --> 01:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
first of all I'm not going to say it's
 
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily in the wrong committee but
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
they're putting it in a chapter of the
 
01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
law books which would normally you know
 
01:59:24.510 --> 01:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
the purview of the committee I belong to
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
Judiciary although I'm glad we have
 
01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
plenty of bills over there so I'm just
 
01:59:29.950 --> 01:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
as happy they didn't send it to us which
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
is the law book about proceedings in
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
special cases so it's not in the
 
01:59:36.189 --> 01:59:36.199 align:start position:0%
election law book but it is a election
 
01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
issue so that part of it's fine um looks
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
like has a very expansive definition of
 
01:59:43.390 --> 01:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
person which I think actually includes
 
01:59:45.629 --> 01:59:45.639 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions which usually
 
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
aren't considered persons for in other
 
01:59:51.870 --> 01:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
areas of the law so that's um so now was
 
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
just just about anybody to sue just
 
01:59:55.550 --> 01:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
about anybody associ with elections I
 
01:59:57.629 --> 01:59:57.639 align:start position:0%
think it's like just goes very far and
 
02:00:00.030 --> 02:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
with elections addition to the
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
doj and um you know there's a election
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
law there is a uh Department that in the
 
02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
department uh while they be across the
 
02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
street now up the road which deals with
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
election issues and I found them been
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
very very helpful regardless of your
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
political persuasion if you believe
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
there's an election law violation and I
 
02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
actually a few years ago actually filed
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
one against uh somebody and well I guess
 
02:00:27.069 --> 02:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
they did not prosecute the person but uh
 
02:00:28.350 --> 02:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
I thought they were very
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
helpful in regards to that so this is a
 
02:00:33.030 --> 02:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
in addition to the doj who I think
 
02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
actually you know do a good job like
 
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
whether the there's also um if if it
 
02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
includes the uh if it affects the result
 
02:00:43.229 --> 02:00:43.239 align:start position:0%
of the election there's also the the
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
ballot law commission which is H part of
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
the secretary's estate's office and they
 
02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
they're pretty permissive and like who
 
02:00:51.629 --> 02:00:51.639 align:start position:0%
can file what although they're set up to
 
02:00:51.639 --> 02:00:52.830 align:start position:0%
can file what although they're set up to
make

02:00:52.830 --> 02:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
decisions quickly and they're usually uh
 
02:00:58.910 --> 02:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
they are usually uh they usually their
 
02:01:00.669 --> 02:01:00.679 align:start position:0%
priority is usually to make the
 
02:01:03.149 --> 02:01:03.159 align:start position:0%
decisions as non-disruptive as as
 
02:01:05.069 --> 02:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
possible but that is another Avenue you
 
02:01:07.629 --> 02:01:07.639 align:start position:0%
can file file uh if you have concerns
 
02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
about how if an election was handled
 
02:01:15.069 --> 02:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
improperly and also um what was it oh
 
02:01:16.510 --> 02:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
also the one thing about the elections
 
02:01:18.790 --> 02:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
is elections are very times sensitive
 
02:01:20.629 --> 02:01:20.639 align:start position:0%
especially if you have an issue with a
 
02:01:22.030 --> 02:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
uh the primary and I was just was
 
02:01:23.709 --> 02:01:23.719 align:start position:0%
talking about a bot you know about an
 
02:01:25.149 --> 02:01:25.159 align:start position:0%
hour ago I was here talking about a
 
02:01:27.229 --> 02:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
ballot law commission proceeding which
 
02:01:29.310 --> 02:01:29.320 align:start position:0%
is a related to the primary those they
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
have a very short turnaround time before
 
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
they have to get to the general election
 
02:01:34.189 --> 02:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
and even in the general election um
 
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
there's not that much time between when
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
the winner of the general election takes
 
02:01:40.750 --> 02:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
takes office so that's uh that's one
 
02:01:43.229 --> 02:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
reason maybe not to have send things to
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
Superior Court and spend years you know
 
02:01:46.950 --> 02:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with some dispute and possibly
 
02:01:48.870 --> 02:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
leaving an office vacant also we have
 
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
frequent elections so even you know if
 
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
you think the wrong candidate loses the
 
02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
election because of a violation of RSA
 
02:01:58.990 --> 02:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
659 um there's there's another election
 
02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
coming up shortly and also
 
02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
elections just about all our elections
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
have federal Offices least the state
 
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
most of our elections have federal
 
02:02:09.550 --> 02:02:09.560 align:start position:0%
office on them as well as State office
 
02:02:11.229 --> 02:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
so you also have the option of of
 
02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
seeking redress in the federal courts
 
02:02:16.470 --> 02:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
although given what's happening the
 
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
federal government I hate to rely too
 
02:02:20.109 --> 02:02:20.119 align:start position:0%
much on what the federal government will
 
02:02:21.990 --> 02:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
or will not be doing in the future but
 
02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
you do have the option of filing in in
 
02:02:27.069 --> 02:02:27.079 align:start position:0%
federal court and um so I would just say
 
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
I just say this bill is unnecessary it
 
02:02:32.310 --> 02:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
goes too far and um you know there may
 
02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
be there may be some legitimate concerns
 
02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
in there but you should probably itl it
 
02:02:40.229 --> 02:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
and also if you're swayed by what uh
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
what rep what the representative from
 
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
Goffstown said and you're in kind of a
 
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
you're in although I will admit you're
 
02:02:46.229 --> 02:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
in kind of a tricky position because
 
02:02:47.550 --> 02:02:47.560 align:start position:0%
he's not just a member of the committee
 
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
but the chair but he alluded to
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
something that happened that involved
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
the election near ing um violation and
 
02:02:57.069 --> 02:02:57.079 align:start position:0%
it might be useful if you think that's a
 
02:02:58.669 --> 02:02:58.679 align:start position:0%
compelling reason to go forward with the
 
02:03:00.510 --> 02:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
bill to maybe have some sort of work
 
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
session and try to get reach some sort
 
02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:03.679 align:start position:0%
of consensus about exactly what it is
 
02:03:06.069 --> 02:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
that happened to representative Barry
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
although and of course in all fairness
 
02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
he might he probably would have wouldn't
 
02:03:11.790 --> 02:03:11.800 align:start position:0%
have wanted to sue anyway even if this
 
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
law was passed because he actually won
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
his election so he wasn't really harmed
 
02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
he may have been grieved by what
 
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
happened he may even have legitimate
 
02:03:22.750 --> 02:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
reasons to seek R addess but he in fact
 
02:03:24.709 --> 02:03:24.719 align:start position:0%
won so he wasn't actually technically
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
harmed by whatever it is that happened
 
02:03:30.189 --> 02:03:30.199 align:start position:0%
but I will say if you're you might yes
 
02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
once again you might want to nail down
 
02:03:33.550 --> 02:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what that anecdote is and what
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
the established facts are and what
 
02:03:37.750 --> 02:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
happened which is not really clear from
 
02:03:40.229 --> 02:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
what he said so anyway that's uh gone
 
02:03:41.709 --> 02:03:41.719 align:start position:0%
over my two minutes already so thank you
 
02:03:44.430 --> 02:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
for your patience and uh so I you to itl
 
02:03:46.830 --> 02:03:46.840 align:start position:0%

02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
thanks okay thank you very much uh will
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
you take questions from sure yes other
 
02:03:53.669 --> 02:03:53.679 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
02:03:55.990 --> 02:03:56.000 align:start position:0%

eventually but uh get it to him sooner
 
02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:04.480 align:start position:0%

is there a second I'll I'll second it
 
03:17:02.229 --> 03:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
representative qua seconds is there
 
03:17:03.550 --> 03:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion of ought to
 
03:17:05.229 --> 03:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill
 
03:17:07.349 --> 03:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
365 representative
 
03:17:07.359 --> 03:17:08.870 align:start position:0%
365 representative
Lane

03:17:08.870 --> 03:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
Lane
 
03:17:11.510 --> 03:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
um in the subcommittee we hadn't had a
 
03:17:15.550 --> 03:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
chance to fully vet this um and uh we
 
03:17:17.630 --> 03:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
were talking about requirements for
 
03:17:20.469 --> 03:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
citizenship and what would work and um
 
03:17:22.550 --> 03:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
our wonderful Legislative Assistant has
 
03:17:24.510 --> 03:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
been helping us in getting uh
 
03:17:28.150 --> 03:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
information so there is some question
 
03:17:31.229 --> 03:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
about whether or not uh it's uh would
 
03:17:34.790 --> 03:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
pass legal muster uh because it has been
 
03:17:37.229 --> 03:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
challenged in other states and um has
 
03:17:40.550 --> 03:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
been struck down and is there another
 
03:17:45.189 --> 03:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
way to get uh proof of citizenship other
 
03:17:49.870 --> 03:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
than um uh some having us have to
 
03:17:51.269 --> 03:17:51.279 align:start position:0%
provide it to the government the
 
03:17:53.750 --> 03:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
government in most part has proof they
 
03:17:56.950 --> 03:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
either have our um birth certificates
 
03:17:59.269 --> 03:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
they have records of our passports and
 
03:18:02.510 --> 03:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
they have records of real uh ID so
 
03:18:05.110 --> 03:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
instead of putting it on us our the
 
03:18:06.750 --> 03:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
government already has a lot of this
 
03:18:08.790 --> 03:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
information and why can't they provide
 
03:18:11.030 --> 03:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
it either to the Secretary of State or
 
03:18:13.150 --> 03:18:13.160 align:start position:0%
provide it to us directly to give so
 
03:18:14.990 --> 03:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
that we don't have to because one of the
 
03:18:17.510 --> 03:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
questions we came up with was
 
03:18:20.550 --> 03:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
what is Indigent and we're going to take
 
03:18:23.990 --> 03:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
an affidavit that you're poor but we
 
03:18:25.830 --> 03:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
won't take an affid David that you are a
 
03:18:29.070 --> 03:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
citizen it just didn't seem to make
 
03:18:33.150 --> 03:18:33.160 align:start position:0%
sense logically so we were headed on
 
03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
talking about it and so um we are going
 
03:18:38.590 --> 03:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
to vote itl just because we think a lot
 
03:18:40.910 --> 03:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
more work and I think there are other
 
03:18:43.830 --> 03:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
ways to accomplish the goal that this
 
03:18:47.309 --> 03:18:47.319 align:start position:0%
bill wants to do um and
 
03:18:50.750 --> 03:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh we could do it in a different way um
 
03:18:54.110 --> 03:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
that that does not put a burden on um
 
03:18:55.790 --> 03:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
people because trying to prove
 
03:18:58.990 --> 03:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
citizenship is expensive for people and
 
03:19:02.189 --> 03:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
um and it takes months and months uh in
 
03:19:04.590 --> 03:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
some cases so it just it doesn't seem
 
03:19:07.710 --> 03:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
right uh to require it particularly for
 
03:19:10.870 --> 03:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
those who can't afford an extra $500 to
 
03:19:14.510 --> 03:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
get their citizenship papers thanks okay
 
03:19:16.950 --> 03:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill um the
 
03:19:18.150 --> 03:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
reason we're moving on this bill while
 
03:19:19.510 --> 03:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's still in the subcommittee is it's
 
03:19:21.229 --> 03:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
an early bill so we just we have to vote
 
03:19:23.990 --> 03:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
on it today because tomorrow oh uh and
 
03:19:25.349 --> 03:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
I'll make that announcement once we get
 
03:19:27.229 --> 03:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
done with this vote but these first
 
03:19:29.510 --> 03:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
three or three are early bills so I will
 
03:19:32.790 --> 03:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
need those reports tonight um tonight no
 
03:19:34.030 --> 03:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
exceptions because those have to be
 
03:19:35.550 --> 03:19:35.560 align:start position:0%
reported out tomorrow so anyway we're on
 
03:19:38.189 --> 03:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
the motion of a to a to pass um on House
 
03:19:40.269 --> 03:19:40.279 align:start position:0%
Bill 365 does any other member wish to
 
03:19:43.030 --> 03:19:43.040 align:start position:0%

responsible for the majority report I
 
03:20:42.070 --> 03:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
assume representative Mirad will be
 
03:20:43.189 --> 03:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
responsible for the Minority Report
 
03:20:45.790 --> 03:20:45.800 align:start position:0%

03:20:47.750 --> 03:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
will close the exec I session for house
 
03:20:49.590 --> 03:20:49.600 align:start position:0%

03:20:51.590 --> 03:20:51.600 align:start position:0%

tomorrow by noon so I need to have them
 
03:20:59.870 --> 03:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
tonight because Lord knows what's going
 
03:21:00.910 --> 03:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
to happen when we have a two-year-old at
 
03:21:02.910 --> 03:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
home so
 
03:21:05.349 --> 03:21:05.359 align:start position:0%

03:21:08.229 --> 03:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
session for cacr 2 relating to the
 
03:21:09.790 --> 03:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
drawing of District boundaries providing
 
03:21:11.469 --> 03:21:11.479 align:start position:0%
that no District boundaries shall be
 
03:21:13.150 --> 03:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
drawn in a way that favors or disfavors
 
03:21:15.309 --> 03:21:15.319 align:start position:0%
any political party or candidate um I
 
03:21:16.750 --> 03:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
will make the motion of inexpedient to
 
03:21:18.950 --> 03:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
legislate is there a second second is
 
03:21:20.550 --> 03:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
there any discussion on the motion of
 
03:21:23.870 --> 03:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
inexp to legislate on cacr 2 represent
 
03:21:26.389 --> 03:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:28.670 --> 03:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
recognized I realized that there's some
 
03:21:30.389 --> 03:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
issues with the way this was originally
 
03:21:32.830 --> 03:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
drafted but I would like to have had the
 
03:21:35.030 --> 03:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
chance to fix some of the issues that
 
03:21:37.630 --> 03:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
were spotted but I also just want to
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
point out to everybody that this is one
 
03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
of the most often cited reforms and
 
03:21:47.189 --> 03:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
reasons for PE voters
 
03:21:50.070 --> 03:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
um not liking our political system and
 
03:21:52.070 --> 03:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
not participating because they do not
 
03:21:54.269 --> 03:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
think that we should be redistricting
 
03:21:57.750 --> 03:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
for ourselves that we should uh I mean
 
03:21:59.110 --> 03:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
for our parties we should be
 
03:22:02.910 --> 03:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
redistricting for our constituents
 
03:22:05.030 --> 03:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
so the first discussion on the motion of
 
03:22:07.309 --> 03:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
anyi to legislated on cacr
 
03:22:10.550 --> 03:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
2 um the only comment that I will
 
03:22:13.750 --> 03:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
add is it's an inherently political
 
03:22:17.269 --> 03:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
process it's a messy process and
 
03:22:19.910 --> 03:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
the more you try to divorce it from what
 
03:22:22.590 --> 03:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
it actually is the more it just becomes
 
03:22:25.750 --> 03:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
even worse in my opinion so I I
 
03:22:27.630 --> 03:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
understand the points of it I understand
 
03:22:30.389 --> 03:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
the argument for it um but when you look
 
03:22:31.790 --> 03:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
at it at the end of the day somebody in
 
03:22:33.269 --> 03:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
a political position somewhere is making
 
03:22:34.870 --> 03:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
a decision about who's going to control
 
03:22:37.790 --> 03:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
this so with that uh if you're ready for
 
03:22:38.990 --> 03:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
the question the clerk will call the
 
03:22:40.550 --> 03:22:40.560 align:start position:0%

03:24:25.229 --> 03:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
someone can if they wish representative
 
03:24:28.070 --> 03:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
wood the uh for for the elections they
 
03:24:31.189 --> 03:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
were talking about the primary for the
 
03:24:34.269 --> 03:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
uh state representative I was doubting
 
03:24:37.349 --> 03:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
whether that first place position is as
 
03:24:41.309 --> 03:24:41.319 align:start position:0%
valid as they this one person indicated
 
03:24:43.349 --> 03:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
and also it seems like we will be adding
 
03:24:45.349 --> 03:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
complication to the Ballance being
 
03:24:48.309 --> 03:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
created so of the districts are a little
 
03:24:50.349 --> 03:24:50.359 align:start position:0%
crazy with the full Tero so I just
 
03:24:52.389 --> 03:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
didn't see the advantage for that
 
03:24:53.990 --> 03:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
particular election and that was what
 
03:24:56.229 --> 03:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
was spelled out in in
 
03:24:58.870 --> 03:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
that yeah you're welcome further
 
03:25:00.189 --> 03:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion of inexperience
 
03:25:01.790 --> 03:25:01.800 align:start position:0%

03:26:17.990 --> 03:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
recognize representative C for a motion
 
03:26:22.790 --> 03:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
I move with u HB 154 be ought to pass is
 
03:26:24.990 --> 03:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
there a second representative wey
 
03:26:26.870 --> 03:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
seconds we're on discussion on the
 
03:26:29.150 --> 03:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
motion of op to pass on House Bill 154
 
03:26:30.790 --> 03:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
is there discussion on the
 
03:26:33.790 --> 03:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
motion this is just a representative C
 
03:26:36.990 --> 03:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
was recognized I'm sorry uh this is just
 
03:26:40.150 --> 03:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
a straightforward uh thing to show that
 
03:26:42.110 --> 03:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
voters do have the right to have their
 
03:26:44.950 --> 03:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
ballots and counted further discussion
 
03:26:49.750 --> 03:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:52.510 --> 03:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
154 that doesn't worry um I'll I'll add
 
03:26:54.670 --> 03:26:54.680 align:start position:0%
I hope that by I hope if this becomes
 
03:26:57.910 --> 03:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
law that less people will do it does
 
03:27:00.030 --> 03:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
that make sense like because they can
 
03:27:02.110 --> 03:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
they won't um because right now we see a
 
03:27:04.269 --> 03:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
lot of people doing like the ride in
 
03:27:06.110 --> 03:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
bubble or intentionally over voting
 
03:27:07.990 --> 03:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
basically forcing the issue and I'm
 
03:27:09.910 --> 03:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
hoping that if voters see that they can
 
03:27:11.389 --> 03:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
do this that they will just run their
 
03:27:12.750 --> 03:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
ballot through the machine because they
 
03:27:16.389 --> 03:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
have the option to um so that's my hope
 
03:27:19.110 --> 03:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
um it's that I am not I do not have
 
03:27:20.750 --> 03:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
enough roll call we you not have enough
 
03:27:22.950 --> 03:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
roll call sheets okay I I'll I'll I'll
 
03:27:25.910 --> 03:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
drag it out of course and we can we can
 
03:27:28.630 --> 03:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
always stand in recess for a minute okay
 
03:27:31.070 --> 03:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lane
 
03:27:35.750 --> 03:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I just my concern is that
 
03:27:37.469 --> 03:27:37.479 align:start position:0%
it's actually going to do the opposite
 
03:27:39.030 --> 03:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
that more people are going to ask for it
 
03:27:40.510 --> 03:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
and it's going to delay the counting of
 
03:27:43.630 --> 03:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
votes and hand counting is show has been
 
03:27:46.429 --> 03:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
shown to be less accurate than um
 
03:27:49.630 --> 03:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
machine counting so I am hoping that I
 
03:27:54.870 --> 03:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
am wrong in my concerns and um and we
 
03:27:54.880 --> 03:27:55.790 align:start position:0%
am wrong in my concerns and um and we
shall

03:27:55.790 --> 03:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
shall
 
03:27:58.150 --> 03:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
see further discussion I I would
 
03:28:00.349 --> 03:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
actually echo part of that um obviously
 
03:28:04.150 --> 03:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
we disagree on the effect but voters I
 
03:28:05.990 --> 03:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
will issue a word of caution is when you
 
03:28:07.550 --> 03:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
do this when you exercise this when you
 
03:28:08.910 --> 03:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
do it either because you forced it or
 
03:28:10.910 --> 03:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
we're potentially going to enable you to
 
03:28:13.469 --> 03:28:13.479 align:start position:0%
do it you're say you're saying I want
 
03:28:15.630 --> 03:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
somebody who's been up for 16 hours
 
03:28:15.640 --> 03:28:17.070 align:start position:0%
somebody who's been up for 16 hours
straight

03:28:17.070 --> 03:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
straight
 
03:28:20.590 --> 03:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
to pull out my ballot and read it
 
03:28:23.030 --> 03:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
amongst other ballots that are either
 
03:28:26.429 --> 03:28:26.439 align:start position:0%
put in that bin or had errors um and to
 
03:28:27.630 --> 03:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
representative Lane's point my
 
03:28:29.510 --> 03:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
experience in the recounts shows me that
 
03:28:31.150 --> 03:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
the machines are far more accurate than
 
03:28:34.030 --> 03:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
the people um and you do I you know I
 
03:28:36.309 --> 03:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
think you have that right um but you
 
03:28:38.070 --> 03:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
kind of take your ballot into you know
 
03:28:39.429 --> 03:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
you you also have the right to suffer
 
03:28:41.510 --> 03:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
the consequences of someone
 
03:28:43.630 --> 03:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
unintentionally who's been up for 16
 
03:28:46.110 --> 03:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
hours misinterpreting your intention on
 
03:28:48.070 --> 03:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
the ballot should there be an issue um
 
03:28:49.469 --> 03:28:49.479 align:start position:0%
I've never you know when we do these
 
03:28:51.870 --> 03:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
recounts I always you know I always I
 
03:28:53.510 --> 03:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
always help on my side with the recounts
 
03:28:54.910 --> 03:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
and I always try to kind of council the
 
03:28:55.870 --> 03:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
candidat that are going through this
 
03:28:58.070 --> 03:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's like when you have a machine town
 
03:29:00.309 --> 03:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
or machine lo location you'll see small
 
03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
changes you'll always see small changes
 
03:29:03.150 --> 03:29:03.160 align:start position:0%
because the people will fill out the
 
03:29:04.510 --> 03:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
ballot wrong and something will be
 
03:29:05.510 --> 03:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
something will be off and something will
 
03:29:07.309 --> 03:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
change you'll see small changes and in
 
03:29:10.070 --> 03:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
hand count towns you either see very
 
03:29:11.830 --> 03:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
little change if any or you see a
 
03:29:14.229 --> 03:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
massive move um because something went
 
03:29:16.229 --> 03:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
horribly wrong so you kind of you kind
 
03:29:17.670 --> 03:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
of take that anyways now that we've
 
03:29:20.269 --> 03:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
delayed this long enough um oh yes
 
03:29:23.309 --> 03:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
representative wood thank you Mr chair
 
03:29:25.030 --> 03:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh you did bring something here's a
 
03:29:29.510 --> 03:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
chance I for us to work as a bipartisan
 
03:29:29.520 --> 03:29:30.550 align:start position:0%
chance I for us to work as a bipartisan
on

03:29:30.550 --> 03:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:29:33.309 --> 03:29:33.319 align:start position:0%
this I was surpris how many people that
 
03:29:35.590 --> 03:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
I know actually think they have the
 
03:29:38.910 --> 03:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
right to do this and um that that whole
 
03:29:40.790 --> 03:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
circumstance that happened really
 
03:29:42.349 --> 03:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
affected some people because they
 
03:29:43.950 --> 03:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
thought that something was taken away
 
03:29:47.309 --> 03:29:47.319 align:start position:0%
from them I think what we can do as a
 
03:29:49.790 --> 03:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
bipartisan is convince people that the
 
03:29:52.429 --> 03:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
election uh the ballots or the the
 
03:29:54.750 --> 03:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
machines work but I think they should
 
03:29:56.469 --> 03:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
have the right to make that decision if
 
03:29:59.269 --> 03:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
they see something that bothers them um
 
03:30:01.990 --> 03:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
this this allows them to take it to the
 
03:30:03.990 --> 03:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
moderator or to somebody else there and
 
03:30:06.189 --> 03:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
have it done the oldfashioned way thank
 
03:30:08.630 --> 03:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
you all right representative
 
03:30:12.950 --> 03:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
Kilmore well and for the last I don't
 
03:30:15.309 --> 03:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
know half dozen elections at least they
 
03:30:17.389 --> 03:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
could just put it in the side machine
 
03:30:19.830 --> 03:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
and it's never been an issue and there's
 
03:30:22.229 --> 03:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
other ballots that are course are handc
 
03:30:26.030 --> 03:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
counted yukaba and a couple others so I
 
03:30:27.630 --> 03:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
don't really see what's a big deal here
 
03:30:29.510 --> 03:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
but I thought I thought everybody had
 
03:30:31.429 --> 03:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
that right right
 
03:30:34.309 --> 03:30:34.319 align:start position:0%

03:39:42.550 --> 03:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
367 uh changing the method of adopting
 
03:39:44.910 --> 03:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
partisan Town elections to be the same
 
03:39:49.590 --> 03:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
as as sending partisan Town elections um
 
03:39:51.269 --> 03:39:51.279 align:start position:0%
and I recognize representative Wei for a
 
03:39:53.269 --> 03:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
motion I'd like to make a motion ought
 
03:39:55.229 --> 03:39:55.239 align:start position:0%
to pass representative William ought to
 
03:39:56.870 --> 03:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
pass is there a second second
 
03:39:59.229 --> 03:39:59.239 align:start position:0%
representative har buia seconds um I
 
03:40:01.229 --> 03:40:01.239 align:start position:0%
know we don't normally talk much during
 
03:40:04.110 --> 03:40:04.120 align:start position:0%
uh EXA um but there was a request to
 
03:40:05.469 --> 03:40:05.479 align:start position:0%
actually explain what was going on here
 
03:40:07.429 --> 03:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
because there was general interest so I
 
03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
would highly recommend that the member
 
03:40:10.670 --> 03:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
who made the motion of ought to pass
 
03:40:13.110 --> 03:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
explain why because uh this will be one
 
03:40:14.750 --> 03:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
of the times in election law where you
 
03:40:21.070 --> 03:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:24.389 --> 03:40:24.399 align:start position:0%
explanation thank you Mr chair uh so
 
03:40:24.399 --> 03:40:25.550 align:start position:0%
explanation thank you Mr chair uh so
this

03:40:25.550 --> 03:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:40:30.189 --> 03:40:30.199 align:start position:0%
is um really just uh leveling the
 
03:40:32.870 --> 03:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
playing field you can resend partisan
 
03:40:34.550 --> 03:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
Town elections so you you have the
 
03:40:37.309 --> 03:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
option to of moving toward partisan Town
 
03:40:41.590 --> 03:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
elections and um this just makes the
 
03:40:44.710 --> 03:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
process for adopting them the same as
 
03:40:47.070 --> 03:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
recent them so it's there's a currently
 
03:40:48.830 --> 03:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
a method for resending partisan Town
 
03:40:51.710 --> 03:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
elections this just makes uh adopting it
 
03:40:56.389 --> 03:40:56.399 align:start position:0%
to be equivalent um and uh it levels the
 
03:40:58.389 --> 03:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
playing field on in terms of how a town
 
03:41:02.030 --> 03:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:04.670 --> 03:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
approach uh yes representative Lane
 
03:41:07.510 --> 03:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
recognized so how in the past have they
 
03:41:10.630 --> 03:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
adopted it if they didn't have a way to
 
03:41:18.429 --> 03:41:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:20.070 --> 03:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
they they there hasn't been many towns
 
03:41:23.030 --> 03:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
that have adopted this um but it's I I
 
03:41:23.910 --> 03:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
believe that the purpose of the
 
03:41:25.510 --> 03:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
legislation is to make the the the
 
03:41:27.030 --> 03:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
method of adoption is the same as the
 
03:41:28.990 --> 03:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
method of resending it so it's it comes
 
03:41:31.510 --> 03:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
in one way and it comes out the same way
 
03:41:34.149 --> 03:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
um to put it on the same playing to put
 
03:41:35.149 --> 03:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
it on the I don't want to say the same
 
03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
playing field but use the same mechanism
 
03:41:39.750 --> 03:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
um but to your question was how have
 
03:41:41.070 --> 03:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
they done in the past the answer is they
 
03:41:45.030 --> 03:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
haven't much not right yeah unless that
 
03:41:45.990 --> 03:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
was the the point you were trying to
 
03:41:48.469 --> 03:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
evoke okay yes I figured I figured
 
03:41:49.510 --> 03:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's where you were going with that
 
03:41:50.510 --> 03:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
and I would I just thought I would
 
03:41:52.510 --> 03:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
indulge you
 
03:41:52.520 --> 03:41:54.229 align:start position:0%
indulge you
so

03:41:54.229 --> 03:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:41:56.550 --> 03:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
um uh they used you know they used to do
 
03:41:57.990 --> 03:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
partisan elections I was looking through
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
some old Manchester election history and
 
03:42:02.910 --> 03:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
they used to have partisan elections um
 
03:42:04.550 --> 03:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh and it just kind of wild looking
 
03:42:05.630 --> 03:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
through local election results and
 
03:42:07.070 --> 03:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
seeing partisan and at some point
 
03:42:08.349 --> 03:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
somebody made the decision to move away
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
from it um you know generally speaking
 
03:42:12.429 --> 03:42:12.439 align:start position:0%
and we have these bills on partisanship
 
03:42:14.389 --> 03:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
and I I kind of just kind of more
 
03:42:15.710 --> 03:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
globally speaking
 
03:42:17.309 --> 03:42:17.319 align:start position:0%
i i i reject the notion that these are
 
03:42:18.870 --> 03:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan elections I understand that
 
03:42:21.030 --> 03:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
they're not listed on the ballot but if
 
03:42:22.110 --> 03:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
you're if we're all going to sit here
 
03:42:23.870 --> 03:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
and pretend like the parties aren't
 
03:42:25.910 --> 03:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
engaging at this level at this point I
 
03:42:27.630 --> 03:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
mean I live lived in Manchester for 12
 
03:42:28.870 --> 03:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
years I will tell you right now the
 
03:42:29.950 --> 03:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester Democrat committee and the
 
03:42:30.990 --> 03:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester Republican committee were
 
03:42:32.510 --> 03:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
both heavily involved in those quote
 
03:42:35.269 --> 03:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan elections so I uh I
 
03:42:38.550 --> 03:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
generally think more globally if you if
 
03:42:39.910 --> 03:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
you at least
 
03:42:42.710 --> 03:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
disclose what party someone is a part of
 
03:42:44.910 --> 03:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
I I think you're going to see turnout in
 
03:42:44.920 --> 03:42:46.710 align:start position:0%
I I think you're going to see turnout in
the

03:42:46.710 --> 03:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:42:48.910 --> 03:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
horribly low turnout elections go up
 
03:42:51.510 --> 03:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
because many voters are not engaged at
 
03:42:53.910 --> 03:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
the minutia level um most people when
 
03:42:54.990 --> 03:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
they move to town don't know who's
 
03:42:56.149 --> 03:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
running and the only thing the only
 
03:42:57.269 --> 03:42:57.279 align:start position:0%
piece of information that they might
 
03:43:00.149 --> 03:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
have is partisanship and for some reason
 
03:43:03.990 --> 03:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
we have decided to deny people that
 
03:43:06.389 --> 03:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
indicator but a party you know a party
 
03:43:08.630 --> 03:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
is not a brand loyalty for life it's
 
03:43:10.309 --> 03:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
just more of a statement about who do
 
03:43:12.149 --> 03:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
you more globally identify with I
 
03:43:14.189 --> 03:43:14.199 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm a republican but I don't
 
03:43:15.790 --> 03:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
identify with every
 
03:43:17.510 --> 03:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh plank of the Republican platform I
 
03:43:19.269 --> 03:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor the legalization of marijuana
 
03:43:20.429 --> 03:43:20.439 align:start position:0%
I've been a longtime supporter of
 
03:43:23.110 --> 03:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
marriage equality um but I'm very
 
03:43:24.830 --> 03:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
conservative on government so I tend you
 
03:43:26.110 --> 03:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
know there's other things I tend to
 
03:43:27.429 --> 03:43:27.439 align:start position:0%
identify more with the Republicans than
 
03:43:28.870 --> 03:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
not so somebody who who knows nothing
 
03:43:30.630 --> 03:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
about me they're going to if they want
 
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
to vote for the candidate of limited
 
03:43:33.670 --> 03:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
government that's the party you know
 
03:43:34.790 --> 03:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to vote Republican if they
 
03:43:35.870 --> 03:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
don't they're going to vote Democrat I
 
03:43:38.110 --> 03:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
think when you deny them when you deny
 
03:43:39.910 --> 03:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
the voter that piece of information I
 
03:43:41.110 --> 03:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
think it actually decreases their
 
03:43:42.510 --> 03:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
turnout I think it decreases their
 
03:43:44.389 --> 03:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
knowledge when they're making a decision
 
03:43:46.189 --> 03:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
um and the partisanship already exists
 
03:43:48.349 --> 03:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
it's just we just pret we just choose to
 
03:43:49.630 --> 03:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
pretend like it doesn't anyways that's
 
03:43:51.870 --> 03:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
my that's my rant uh anyone else wants
 
03:43:55.269 --> 03:43:55.279 align:start position:0%
to speak to uh House Bill
 
03:44:01.710 --> 03:44:01.720 align:start position:0%
356 representative weary so just um it
 
03:44:05.790 --> 03:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
um the RSA uh that addresses special
 
03:44:08.309 --> 03:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
Provisions for partisan ballot systems
 
03:44:10.510 --> 03:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
begins in 669
 
03:44:15.630 --> 03:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
37 and uh carries on for
 
03:44:19.950 --> 03:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
um several Pages after that so if people
 
03:44:22.510 --> 03:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
are particularly interested in finding
 
03:44:26.189 --> 03:44:26.199 align:start position:0%
out all the specific details of of that
 
03:44:29.229 --> 03:44:29.239 align:start position:0%
area of the rsas that is the area to be
 
03:44:29.239 --> 03:44:30.189 align:start position:0%
area of the rsas that is the area to be
looking

03:44:30.189 --> 03:44:30.199 align:start position:0%
looking
 
03:44:32.510 --> 03:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
at all right further discussion on the
 
03:44:34.670 --> 03:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
motion of oop pass on House Bill
 
03:44:38.670 --> 03:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
367 um representative
 
03:44:42.389 --> 03:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
Gore thank you um the question I have is
 
03:44:45.349 --> 03:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
this is for Town elections Do's a city
 
03:44:47.309 --> 03:44:47.319 align:start position:0%
do I believe was the first city in the
 
03:44:49.070 --> 03:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
state that went nonpartisan that was
 
03:44:53.469 --> 03:44:53.479 align:start position:0%
well over 50 years ago um how's does
 
03:44:56.110 --> 03:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
this affect cities could it C he go back
 
03:44:59.750 --> 03:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
to no parison but you can't under
 
03:45:02.389 --> 03:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
this that's my question that's a great
 
03:45:09.550 --> 03:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:13.030 --> 03:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
look I'm just reading it real fast
 
03:45:16.870 --> 03:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's a great question though
 
03:45:19.630 --> 03:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
procedure and outline is
 
03:45:21.990 --> 03:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
6699 anybody beats me to it feel free to
 
03:45:25.590 --> 03:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:31.750 --> 03:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
Town line line two on page two any Town
 
03:45:34.149 --> 03:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
may vote to
 
03:45:38.550 --> 03:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
adopt the change referal into
 
03:45:41.630 --> 03:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
towns yes but there is a method for
 
03:45:41.640 --> 03:45:47.189 align:start position:0%
towns yes but there is a method for
partisan

03:45:47.189 --> 03:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:48.830 --> 03:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
City chart I mean the cities operate
 
03:45:51.189 --> 03:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
under a different system and I'm trying
 
03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:57.670 --> 03:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
is um I think it well I think to answer
 
03:45:58.910 --> 03:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative Gilmore's question I
 
03:46:00.790 --> 03:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
think it I think on face value it only
 
03:46:03.189 --> 03:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
applies to towns um that's what the bill
 
03:46:03.199 --> 03:46:04.070 align:start position:0%
applies to towns um that's what the bill
says

03:46:04.070 --> 03:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
says
 
03:46:04.080 --> 03:46:05.389 align:start position:0%
says
[Music]

03:46:05.389 --> 03:46:05.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:46:08.070 --> 03:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
um but well I I do think that's more of
 
03:46:09.030 --> 03:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
a I'm going to write that down because
 
03:46:10.870 --> 03:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's actually I want to review that
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
statute for cities in general I the city
 
03:46:15.710 --> 03:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
operates under the city char of course
 
03:46:17.590 --> 03:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
and I think it's probably in there that
 
03:46:20.149 --> 03:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
we'd have to do it but again I don't
 
03:46:22.429 --> 03:46:22.439 align:start position:0%
know what the process is though it was a
 
03:46:25.349 --> 03:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
city chart yeah and the name of chapter
 
03:46:32.070 --> 03:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:34.189 --> 03:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
districts yeah that's a great that's a
 
03:46:34.199 --> 03:46:35.389 align:start position:0%
districts yeah that's a great that's a
great

03:46:35.389 --> 03:46:35.399 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:46:37.630 --> 03:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
uh I'm have to do some research so thank
 
03:46:40.070 --> 03:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
you I was GNA have to go go I said I
 
03:46:42.269 --> 03:46:42.279 align:start position:0%
learn every time um all right further
 
03:46:44.469 --> 03:46:44.479 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion of ought to
 
03:46:46.510 --> 03:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
pass on house 367 representative Newsome
 
03:46:48.630 --> 03:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
you're recognized thank you um just a
 
03:46:50.550 --> 03:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
quick question does this affect whether
 
03:46:53.110 --> 03:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
it's on the business meeting or the
 
03:46:55.550 --> 03:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
ballot uh so this is on the partisan
 
03:46:57.110 --> 03:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
this is on the partisan official ballot
 
03:46:59.630 --> 03:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
system so my guesses would it be it
 
03:47:01.670 --> 03:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't but I guess which way is it
 
03:47:04.269 --> 03:47:04.279 align:start position:0%
before the legislation does that move it
 
03:47:06.830 --> 03:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
from one to the other is the question I
 
03:47:08.429 --> 03:47:08.439 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's it's not moving
 
03:47:12.670 --> 03:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
anything it's adding um it's adding to
 
03:47:12.680 --> 03:47:15.750 align:start position:0%
anything it's adding um it's adding to
6692

03:47:15.750 --> 03:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:17.870 --> 03:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
and taking away from
 
03:47:21.309 --> 03:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
the it's it's editing 12 and 13 so it's
 
03:47:23.750 --> 03:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
not really moving I guess I don't
 
03:47:25.469 --> 03:47:25.479 align:start position:0%
understand the question I'm sorry well I
 
03:47:27.710 --> 03:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
guess before the like today would it be
 
03:47:29.870 --> 03:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
done during the business meeting or the
 
03:47:31.710 --> 03:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
balloting oh you're asking how it would
 
03:47:33.830 --> 03:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
be done today yes okay and does this
 
03:47:36.910 --> 03:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
change that so whether from the business
 
03:47:38.710 --> 03:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
meeting or the ballot system yep so
 
03:47:41.510 --> 03:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
currently I I'll I'll read 1612 any Town
 
03:47:43.710 --> 03:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
May adopt may vote to adopt the partisan
 
03:47:45.309 --> 03:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
official ballot system for for election
 
03:47:47.870 --> 03:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
of town officers under an article in the
 
03:47:49.910 --> 03:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
warrant for any town meeting and may
 
03:47:52.309 --> 03:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
resend such action in like manner the
 
03:47:54.830 --> 03:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
partisan ballot system shall not be in
 
03:47:57.189 --> 03:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
effect until Town election follow first
 
03:47:59.309 --> 03:47:59.319 align:start position:0%
following the town meeting at which such
 
03:48:01.870 --> 03:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
system is adopted a plurality shall
 
03:48:05.030 --> 03:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
elect in towns using the partisan ballot
 
03:48:07.389 --> 03:48:07.399 align:start position:0%
system did I did I sufficiently dodge
 
03:48:10.189 --> 03:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
the question you dodged it very well but
 
03:48:13.309 --> 03:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
then I guess it it begs a followup
 
03:48:17.110 --> 03:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
question is that um the bill is says
 
03:48:19.630 --> 03:48:19.640 align:start position:0%
that it is making the adoption and the
 
03:48:22.550 --> 03:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
recision the same yet yeah what a messy
 
03:48:25.189 --> 03:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
RSA they're taking resin such such
 
03:48:28.110 --> 03:48:28.120 align:start position:0%
action in like manner yeah so we're
 
03:48:30.990 --> 03:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
already there but why even have the and
 
03:48:32.389 --> 03:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's I guess where my
 
03:48:34.349 --> 03:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
additional confusion is coming from and
 
03:48:37.910 --> 03:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's a fair point if I may Mr chair
 
03:48:41.110 --> 03:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah I think in 669 where it
 
03:48:43.630 --> 03:48:43.640 align:start position:0%
talks about in any town in which so
 
03:48:46.550 --> 03:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
three line three four lines down in
 
03:48:49.510 --> 03:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
66913 talks about in any town in which
 
03:48:51.630 --> 03:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
the partisan ballot system is in effect
 
03:48:53.269 --> 03:48:53.279 align:start position:0%
and which has a population according to
 
03:48:56.750 --> 03:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
most recent Federal right so it's line
 
03:49:00.030 --> 03:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
20 it's struck yeah so can you just
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
strike that and then do you need this
 
03:49:05.349 --> 03:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
because it's already in
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
here that was kind of where I was head
 
03:49:09.469 --> 03:49:09.479 align:start position:0%
like yeah that's actually I think
 
03:49:10.710 --> 03:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
representative Lane's making a good
 
03:49:12.030 --> 03:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
point do you even need the rest of that
 
03:49:13.710 --> 03:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
language because it already
 
03:49:17.269 --> 03:49:17.279 align:start position:0%
says actually if it says oh I don't want
 
03:49:19.030 --> 03:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
I don't want to still representative new
 
03:49:22.670 --> 03:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
Thunder here no I tell you what let's uh
 
03:49:25.070 --> 03:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
let's let's recess this bill okay I
 
03:49:26.870 --> 03:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
think that there's there's
 
03:49:30.670 --> 03:49:30.680 align:start position:0%

03:56:49.590 --> 03:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
administer um you know and it really
 
03:56:52.710 --> 03:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
offers an opportunity to
 
03:56:57.870 --> 03:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
provide uh really a a chance
 
03:57:04.149 --> 03:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
to give voters uh more choices uh would
 
03:57:07.189 --> 03:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
improve uh the quality of campaigning
 
03:57:12.030 --> 03:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
would improve the uh the tenor of
 
03:57:14.910 --> 03:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
campaigns uh which I think uh Granite
 
03:57:17.149 --> 03:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
Staters deserve you know if their
 
03:57:19.349 --> 03:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
municipality decides to go with it so
 
03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's a local control issue and um I
 
03:57:22.870 --> 03:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
think we should Empower our
 
03:57:24.469 --> 03:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities to make the best
 
03:57:26.910 --> 03:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
decisions uh for them thanks
 
03:57:28.870 --> 03:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative hary buly is recognized
 
03:57:31.030 --> 03:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair real quick um I know
 
03:57:33.149 --> 03:57:33.159 align:start position:0%
rank choice this bill uh promised a lot
 
03:57:35.269 --> 03:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
of things but there are three main
 
03:57:37.830 --> 03:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
things uh that are going against it and
 
03:57:39.510 --> 03:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
one it threatens fast and accurate
 
03:57:42.389 --> 03:57:42.399 align:start position:0%
ballot counting uh it produces slow
 
03:57:45.269 --> 03:57:45.279 align:start position:0%
results and more regularity it has
 
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
technical problems which I'm aware of uh
 
03:57:51.149 --> 03:57:51.159 align:start position:0%
working in in the industry um there's at
 
03:57:52.910 --> 03:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
least three states that I saw that had
 
03:57:56.429 --> 03:57:56.439 align:start position:0%
technical software issues or hardware
 
03:58:00.830 --> 03:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
issues uh regarding these uh the system
 
03:58:02.229 --> 03:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
number two it diminishes voter
 
03:58:04.590 --> 03:58:04.600 align:start position:0%
confidence it's overly complicated it is
 
03:58:06.950 --> 03:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
confusing it requires voters to make
 
03:58:09.830 --> 03:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
decisions on all the candidates which a
 
03:58:11.950 --> 03:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
lot of Voters don't and three the worst
 
03:58:14.269 --> 03:58:14.279 align:start position:0%
thing about this is it uh leads to to
 
03:58:17.670 --> 03:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
gamesmanship in voting thank
 
03:58:20.830 --> 03:58:20.840 align:start position:0%

03:58:28.910 --> 03:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
states in which it exists seems to be
 
03:58:30.710 --> 03:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
very popular in the countries in which
 
03:58:32.510 --> 03:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
it exists and the person with the
 
03:58:35.269 --> 03:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
highest votes actually gets a plurality
 
03:58:39.790 --> 03:58:39.800 align:start position:0%
