00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone um I am John Hunt
 
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
I live in live in ringe New Hampshire um
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
and over the year over the year you'll
 
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
all get to hear one of my wonderful
 
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
stories that I have since this is my
 
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
38th year here I've been here um having
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
said that um I do want to uh begin with
 
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
have introductions because we do have
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
several new members and then the new
 
00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:42.519 align:start position:0%
members can get to meet some of the old
 
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
members I would say this year um is the
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
the the least amount of turnover that
 
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
Commerce had and historically we've
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
always had a lot uh lot of turnover but
 
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
uh this this time around uh it seems
 
00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
like everybody on the Republican
 
00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
Democrats a lot return
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
and came back which is good so what did
 
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
you say about Republicans but
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
Republicans and Democrats returned
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
Democrats okay yeah no I said it's been
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
been a
 
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
great coming back and as you all notice
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
that uh my minority leader and I have
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
gotten to know each other very well over
 
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.590 align:start position:0%
gotten to know each other very well over
the

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
years and uh things can be very casual
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
here so uh I know that other committees
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
you'll find that we're not as as casual
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
as we are so so
 
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh don't don't take what we happen to do
 
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
here and then go think you can do it in
 
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:35.079 align:start position:0%
another committee because I've heard
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
horror stories about that so um we'll
 
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
start go around we'll
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh you're going to be first because I
 
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:45.560 align:start position:0%

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
fun hi I'm Anita Burrows this is my
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
fourth term my third one in Commerce
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
unlike chairman hunt I have not been
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
here since
 
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.230 align:start position:0%
here since
1890

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
1890
 
00:16:29.309 --> 00:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
um but um anyway um the thing I like
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
about this committee is that it's very
 
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
bipartisan I I'm arguably a little
 
00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:35.079 align:start position:0%
Prejudice I think it's the best
 
00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
committee to be on um in the state house
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
because we all get along and we pass a
 
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
lot of bills and um there's little of
 
00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%

Tech uh and although I have been asked
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
to be on the science and Tech committee
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh as part of the loyal oppos uh loyal
 
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
opposition I chose this committee to be
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
on it for my second term in loyalty to
 
00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:10.839 align:start position:0%
John because he runs a really good
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
committee and I've subbed on all of them
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
continuing OE to John I think that this
 
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:39.160 align:start position:0%

live in Bethlehem uh this is my second
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
term and I kind of echo what everybody
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
else says I think it's the best
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
committee to be on I've sat in and
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
subbed on other committees and I've
 
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
presented bills and uh there's
 
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
definitely a lot more animosity and it
 
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:26.360 align:start position:0%
seems to be less friendly if you on
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
another committee so if you if some of
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
the new people get a chance to go do
 
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
that I think you'll see what I mean
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
after your experience working here uh so
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
when you end of the day please don't
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
leave things on the desks because they
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
don't know what to do with it and and uh
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
they they probably get thrown away um in
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
terms of the committee um we we are uh
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
10 to eight 10 10 Republicans eight
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
Democrats and
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things unusual that we do on
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
this committee um and this is this we've
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
been this Traditions it's been almost 15
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
years I guess is that we're going to
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
divide up into
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and we have three
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittees uh so when you hear the
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
people testify and you can kind of
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
choose which subcommittee you want to be
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
on um and the subcommittee choices is uh
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
is is banking business so that'll be
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
consumer protection type issues and the
 
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
banking issues um then we have the
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission and Liquor Commission
 
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
um is one of those things that uh that
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
years and years ago used to go to a
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
different committee but um because I
 
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
passed the direct shipping law the uh
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
don aitech thought it was a good idea
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
that all the liquor laws bills come to
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
this committee so we've had it for a
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
fair amount of years um and the
 
00:22:59.710 --> 00:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
marijuana legis ation because we had a
 
00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:02.919 align:start position:0%
bill that uh related to that the Liquor
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
Commission would be the enforcement
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
agency that that's why marijuana now
 
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
comes to this committee and I know we
 
00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:11.559 align:start position:0%
have representative sullon has has a
 
00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
bill I've seen it already and last but
 
00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:18.919 align:start position:0%
not least is we have insurance now in
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
past years we've kind of divided up into
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
health insurance and property casualty
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
but we've had less and less PC bills and
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
more health insurance bills and and it
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
varies so right now that'll be just one
 
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
committee insurance so think in terms of
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
those three divisions which ones you
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
want to participate
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
in three because
 
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
look Banking and
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
business banking businesses
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
together and then and um so it has
 
00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
varied somewhat over the years uh and
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
really is the nature of the bills but I
 
00:23:57.789 --> 00:23:57.799 align:start position:0%
this this seems to be the model what we
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
did last term so it worked out pretty
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
well um
 
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
okay public hearings um the big the
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
amount of public hearing and I guess for
 
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
for new members just to emphasize that
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
this is not the Grand in Inquisition you
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
um all we're trying to do is someone
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
comes in the sponsor presents the bill
 
00:24:21.789 --> 00:24:21.799 align:start position:0%
presents what they're trying to solve
 
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
because sometimes like most of the time
 
00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't actually do that the
 
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
way it's written uh and then it's up to
 
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
this committee to sort through that and
 
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
um and then people will then get up and
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
speak for and against it um so you we
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to ask questions so
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
you know your questions really are
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
you're you're trying to gain information
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
you're trying to solve things in your
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
head but please do not try to uh get
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
into debating with the person who who's
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
testifying and um try to try to get make
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
it quick as possible um and not have
 
00:24:59.070 --> 00:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
long drawn out question questions
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert's not
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
here no you're no you're not that bad
 
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
but you can you do like the little begin
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
beginning speech with your question so
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
um okay um
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
so you will we have I know there's this
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
rule 44 you up to you what you do I can
 
00:25:23.789 --> 00:25:23.799 align:start position:0%
all I can tell you is that historically
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
this is the way I've always treated it
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
is that every bill has a grain of Truth
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
and um even though we're all going to
 
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
you know pretty much want to kill the
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
bill um I don't take up bills the same
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
day we have that legislation all that
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
allows us to do that um I always believe
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
every Bill gets should have 24 hours
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
before we kill it and uh so so in terms
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
of in this committee what we do
 
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
differently is that that Bill gets more
 
00:25:54.029 --> 00:25:54.039 align:start position:0%
than 24 hours because any bill that we
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
have will go to that subcommittee and
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
that individual subcommittee can then
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
and thrash over it and or make a quick
 
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
decision whichever way it works and and
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
then that is brought to the full
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
committee so by the time we get to our
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
exec session we we have really each
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
SubCom each bill has had its second by
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
at the Apple in that subcommittee and
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
it's had a process to be debated and
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
discussed so usually in our exec
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
sessions we are very expeditious in
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
terms of moving bills out of this
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
committee um unlike you'll hear from
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
other committees where they can spend
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
hours debating a bill which we don't
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
because we that debate should have
 
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:36.039 align:start position:0%
happened on the subcommittee
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
level uh I guess other than that do you
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
have any ideas anything else we should
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
let everybody
 
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.389 align:start position:0%
let everybody
know

00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
um I guess the only other thing you know
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
most most people have been here before
 
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
but um we will um have Dem caucuses and
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
Republican caucuses outside of the
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
hearings and it's just so that um
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
Democrats can come to a um some kind of
 
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh understanding of where we stand and
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
Republicans will do the same but um last
 
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
two years we uh seem to agree on most of
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
the bills it was it was actually a
 
00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:15.149 align:start position:0%
the bills it was it was actually a
little

00:27:15.149 --> 00:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
scary yes no we we did really well um I
 
00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
tell everybody that we didn't in the two
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
years we didn't really have any major
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
floor debates um maybe the marijuana
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
bill was a floor debate but
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't that major floor debate so
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
okay uh being now close to 10:30 we'll
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
um start in on the insurance
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
department and we are very lucky to have
 
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
the insurance commissioner
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
here with many of his
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
cohorts you have an interesting
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
definition of Lucky Mr
 
00:27:54.799 --> 00:27:56.710 align:start position:0%
definition of Lucky Mr
chairman

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
assigned to this committee I'm going to
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%

beton cour I have the pleasure of
 
00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
serving as the commissioner of the New
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department I'm
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
joined by my colleagues Deputy
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Keith Nyan assistant
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jason Dexter and in the
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
back Jennifer Smith our legislative
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
director along with our subject matter
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
experts these are the faces that you're
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
going to see uh throughout the course of
 
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
this term on legislation related to
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
Insurance whether they be bills that the
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
department has put forward or has asked
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
all of you to put forward on our behalf
 
00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
or whether we have come in to testify on
 
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
insurance related items that we think
 
00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
you should have some information or some
 
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
background on as you deliberate and
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
consider what you would like to do
 
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
with the bill so I think all of you have
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
in front of you a slide presentation I'm
 
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
going to try to go through that as
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
quickly as I can the team and I have
 
00:29:09.549 --> 00:29:09.559 align:start position:0%
split up this presentation so you don't
 
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
have to hear me drone on and on you can
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
hear from them as well so first and
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
foremost our mission the mission of the
 
00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:18.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire insurance department is to
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
promote the public good by ensuring the
 
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
existence of a safe and competitive
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
Insurance Marketplace through the
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
development and enforcement of New
 
00:29:27.149 --> 00:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's insurance laws we are
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
committed to doing that in an honest
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
effective and timely manner what all of
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
that really means for me is consumer
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
protection that is at the heart of the
 
00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:39.519 align:start position:0%
Department's Mission and accomplishing
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
that mission takes on many different
 
00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:46.039 align:start position:0%
types of forms whether they be as
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
mission statement says ensuring good
 
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
competitive Insurance markets so that
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
consumers have a lot of choices that
 
00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
they can make when they are getting
 
00:29:54.669 --> 00:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
their coverages ensuring that the
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
marketplace is competitive I'm a firm
 
00:29:59.549 --> 00:29:59.559 align:start position:0%
believer in the the free market system
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
but core to that system is a lot of
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
competition taking place companies
 
00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:07.519 align:start position:0%
competing for those covered lives
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
bringing forth better products more
 
00:30:12.669 --> 00:30:12.679 align:start position:0%
quality products and ultimately keeping
 
00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
the premiums affordable for the
 
00:30:17.509 --> 00:30:17.519 align:start position:0%
consumers so consumer protection is
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
really as I've said at the heart of our
 
00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:21.559 align:start position:0%
mission Department overview you can read
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
about me I'm not that interesting uh
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
what you should know is the department
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
currently has 91 full-time in two
 
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
part-time staff positions as part of the
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
budget exercise that Governor senu asked
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
us to go through this past fall and I
 
00:30:39.389 --> 00:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
think what the incoming Governor will
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
hold us to is we're going to be a little
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
bit Slimmer I think we ended up un
 
00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
funding three or four positions in two
 
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
part-time positions so we are running I
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
think very
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
appropriately um lean but having enough
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
staff to make sure that we are doing the
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
job that we are supposed to do in an
 
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.789 align:start position:0%
job that we are supposed to do in an
effective

00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
manner little bit about the department
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
so the New Hampshire insurance
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
department was established in
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
1851 and we have the distinction here in
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire of being the first state
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
to create an insurance department so
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
that's a little interesting trivia for
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
you as you're having lunch over at the
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
um Barley House or tandies or whatever
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
if they ask that question you'll know
 
00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919 align:start position:0%
1851 New Hampshire was the first uh
 
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see the pertinent statutes before
 
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
you as to where the rules and
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
regulations as they pertain to Insurance
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
live within the vast world of New
 
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.710 align:start position:0%
live within the vast world of New
Hampshire

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
statute as you know we are tasked with
 
00:31:43.389 --> 00:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the insurance laws of New
 
00:31:45.789 --> 00:31:45.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire some of the notable ones too
 
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
although I know this will be more of a
 
00:31:49.629 --> 00:31:49.639 align:start position:0%
focus of your colleagues over on the
 
00:31:51.549 --> 00:31:51.559 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee but it also
 
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
includes the collection of Premium taxes
 
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
and fees and then you'll deal with the
 
00:31:58.269 --> 00:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
second half of this note which is the
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
regulation of all insurance companies
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
producers consultants and adjusters when
 
00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:05.559 align:start position:0%
you hear the word producers by the way
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
uh you can think of that in terms of
 
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
Agents both captive and independent
 
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
agents Brokers things of that nature
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
just to help you a little bit with the
 
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
nomenclature so in terms of Revenue and
 
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
funding I'll turn it over to my
 
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
colleague Jason
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
Dexter right thank you JJ again my name
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
is Jason dexer assistant commissioner
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
over at the insurance department top of
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
the slide says revenue and funding those
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
are two different things for the purpose
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
of this slide revenue is the what the
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
department collects um for general fund
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
Revenue to fund State the state budget
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh we do that a couple of different ways
 
00:32:45.629 --> 00:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
we collect that through premium taxes uh
 
00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919 align:start position:0%
licensing fees and administrative fines
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
um we going to talk a little bit more
 
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
about licensing later on and then the
 
00:32:56.629 --> 00:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
second part of that is the funding and
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
that's the funding of our Department we
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
are um a self-funded department we do an
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
administrative assessment each year um
 
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
to collect the funds to support our
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
budget which is roughly $13
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
million um and then we collect that each
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
year and if we've underspent our budget
 
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
we do a little offset um so last year we
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
invoiced about 12.6
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
million that's uh revenue and
 
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
funding get this point with the
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
presentation we're going to get into a
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
little bit about the what we do in a
 
00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
little more detail
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
um first thing on slide six speaks to
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
licensing we license many different
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
types of entities including companies
 
00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.590 align:start position:0%
types of entities including companies
producers

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
producers
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
adjusters um and tpas as well Keith's
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
going to get into that in more detail on
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
slide 15 um another thing we do on both
 
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
our property casual side and our life
 
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
and health side is we review form
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
so if an insurance company wants to put
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
a new product out into the market that's
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
going to be an insurance form in the
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
life and health side that comes to us we
 
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
review the form for compliance with our
 
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
state laws and regulations they can't
 
00:34:15.069 --> 00:34:15.079 align:start position:0%
they can't sell it until we say okay uh
 
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
on the PNC side of the business they do
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
a um file and use where they file U they
 
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
can move those products into the market
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
but we do end up reviewing them and if
 
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
there are issues we resolve them
 
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to turn it over
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
to DJ back to you thank you Jason just a
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
couple of other notes on that so as
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
Jason mentioned we are a self-funded
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
agency folks are often curious how that
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
works the insurance companies doing
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire are assessed
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
and they are assessed based on a per
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
capita of the written premium that they
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
write here in New Hampshire so obviously
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
the assessment for some companies is
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
greater than it is for other companies
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
we were able to uh lower the assessment
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
upfront coming into the next year it'll
 
00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:06.599 align:start position:0%
be lower by about half million doll
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
which in the grand scheme of things of
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
course is not a ton but at a time when
 
00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
we are seeing a hardening of insurance
 
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
markets and I'll get a little bit more
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
into that later I think anything that we
 
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
can do as a department to signal to
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
Industry that we're going to work with
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
them and to assist them to get through
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
these difficult markets to get through
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
this difficult per period I think it's a
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
positive sign not for us but again at
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
the end of the day it's all geared
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
towards how can we help the
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
consumers so in fiscal year 24 we
 
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
actually as Jason mentioned rebated back
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
two companies over $2.7 million it was
 
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
the result of us doing a good job of
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
carefully budgeting and keeping our eye
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
on the spending within the department we
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
don't roll any dollars over whatever is
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
not spent at the end of the fiscal year
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
again is given back to the companies
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day it is
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
their money and we obviously hope that
 
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
the money that is returned they will
 
00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
apply to finding ways to reduce premiums
 
00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
for consumers though they're not
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's our first day too we're working out
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
the Kinks bear with us I so why don't we
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
jump ahead to uh producer licensing
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
which is actually a little bit forward
 
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
in your presentation deck or if you wish
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner we can go directly to I
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
think it's slide 13 talking about the
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
National Association of insurance
 
00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um it's a fairly robust
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
looking slide this is actually a great
 
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to segue into what it
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
means to be uh in an industry which is
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
state-based regulation which is the
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
insurance industry unlike our
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
counterparts in uh Financial Services in
 
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
um Securities and banking um Insurance
 
00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
across this country is regulated at the
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
state level one of the biggest
 
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
differences or that people are confused
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
by is the fact that back in 2010 uh
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
through the Dodd Frank consumer
 
00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
protection act there was the creation of
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
the federal insurance office the federal
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
insurance office office is not a
 
00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
regulatory body it's an advisory councel
 
00:37:35.069 --> 00:37:35.079 align:start position:0%
um that office does provide information
 
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of coordination with our
 
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
overseas counterparts and other
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
insurance markets but that is an
 
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board um primarily insurance is
 
00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
regulated at the state level as the
 
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned previously uh New
 
00:37:51.309 --> 00:37:51.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was the first state insurance
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
department um we currently license here
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire 1,200
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
28 insurance companies that do business
 
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
um additionally there are um know tying
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
that back to our producers we also
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
license about
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
245,000 um Insurance Producers and
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
adjusters um separating that out we have
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
115,000 114,000
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
adjusters back to the neic the neic is
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
an organization which is the name
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
suggest the National Association of
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
insurance Commissioners is an
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
association of all 50 State Insurance
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
departments as well as our five US
 
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
territories the goal of the association
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
is to bring uniformity to regulation
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
across the country um the organization
 
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
does that by supporting the insurance
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
departments with information as well as
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
we meet annually uh to develop model
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
laws and develop Financial regulatory
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
standards um frequently the department
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
will bring forward bills
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
um in laws relative to financial
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
regulated Financial regulation standards
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
those being model laws that's again
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
bring uniformity across the country as
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
we look to entities that not only write
 
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
insurance in New Hampshire but every
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
other state as
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
well that I'll turn it back to you
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you Keith so a couple
 
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
of other core things that we do we
 
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
provide uh oversight in uh for the
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
financial health of the companies who
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
are domiciled here in New Hampshire uh
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
so we conduct Financial examinations and
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
Analysis of the companies doing business
 
00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:37.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to ensure Financial
 
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
solvency makes a lot of sense it's
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
awfully hard for a company to pay claims
 
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
if they are bankrupt so we make sure
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
that that does not happen we do that too
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
through Market conduct analysis and
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
exams of companies doing business in New
 
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire again to not just look at
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
their Financial Health but also to
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that they are in compliance with
 
00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's laws and regulations
 
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
Keith talked about the niic just to give
 
00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:05.079 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of insight as to how
 
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:07.640 align:start position:0%
the financial examination piece works
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
together across 50 states and six or
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
seven US territories however many there
 
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
are so the neic has an accreditation
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
program that every state goes through
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
every five years and so what that means
 
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
is they'll send their staff into the
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
department to make sure that the process
 
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
that we go through and all of the
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
analysis that takes place of our
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
domestic companies is up to appropriate
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
standard how this works is essentially a
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
little bit of the full faith in credit
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
type concept which is we'll do the
 
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
financial analysis that deep level dive
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
of all of the companies domiciled in New
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which means they're
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
established here this is their
 
00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
headquarters and so by virtue of us
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
having gotten accreditation from the
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
niic all of the other states know that
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
they can rely on New Hampshire's
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
analysis of our domestic companies so
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
that when those companies want to go and
 
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
write in their states they know that
 
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
they've got a company that has
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate Financial Health and
 
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:12.200 align:start position:0%
reserves to pay claims and then vice
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
versa when a company wants to come in
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
and write in New Hampshire we know that
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
the state that they're domiciled in has
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
done their due diligence on the
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
financial side of things so the niic is
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
a pretty important entity insurance is
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
really the last Bastion of a major
 
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
industry in the United States of America
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
that is predominantly regulated at the
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
state level the ACA obviously has a
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
pretty significant impact on the health
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
insurance side of things but everything
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
else predominantly handled at the state
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
level and the NAIC helps for us to
 
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
coordinate to make sure that there is
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
some uniformity so that companies are
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
not having to deal with a vastly
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
different Patchwork of regulatory
 
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
environments other things that we do is
 
00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:57.640 align:start position:0%
we investigate and prosecute insurance
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
fraud so in fiscal year 25 we had
 
00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
457 referrals to the department opened
 
00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
up 24 new cases and made 15 submissions
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
for prosecutions our fraud team works
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
with the County attorneys we work with
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office and we
 
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:17.079 align:start position:0%
work with the US attorney's office my
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
team will do all of the investigation
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
they'll put basically the case together
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
for the prosecutor and then hand it over
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
the to the prosecutor for his or her
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether or not they want
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
to bring the case
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
forward additionally our enforcement
 
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
unit uh conducted looks at the producers
 
00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:39.559 align:start position:0%
and the companies to make sure that they
 
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:41.720 align:start position:0%
are not running a foul of laws and rules
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
so I kind of distinguish between the two
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
units this way the Fraud Unit looks at
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
crimes that may have been committed by
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
the public to the insurance industry the
 
00:42:54.549 --> 00:42:54.559 align:start position:0%
enforcement team looks to see that the
 
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
insurance industry is not doing anything
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
that it should should should not do that
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
is going to impact consumers in fiscal
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
year 24 our enforcement team
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
investigated 3113 cases and assessed
 
00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.030 align:start position:0%
investigated 3113 cases and assessed
$856,000

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
$856,000
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
worth of
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
fines we also conduct public hearings
 
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
including workers compensation premium
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
rates as well as our annual hearing for
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
cost drivers in healthcare New
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just a little bit of
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
background on workers comp so this year
 
00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:29.559 align:start position:0%
or excuse me last year we approved the
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
13th consecutive reduction in workers
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
compensation rates it was lowered by an
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
additional 5.6% for
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
2025 and over the course of that 13-year
 
00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
period New Hampshire has seen a
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
65% reduction in our workers
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
compensation rates which is obviously a
 
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
very very positive development for our
 
00:43:55.549 --> 00:43:55.559 align:start position:0%
business Community I get to make the
 
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
announcement every year
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
truth be told we don't get a ton of
 
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
credit for that because we don't deserve
 
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
a ton of credit for that the credit
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
really does go to the business Community
 
00:44:08.349 --> 00:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
which has taken a lot of steps over the
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
years to make their workplaces safer to
 
00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
make the best care available for them so
 
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
that God forbid when an injury takes
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
place at work the person is getting that
 
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
care right away in getting back into the
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
workforce getting back to work more
 
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
quickly so it really is a testament to
 
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
the responsible nature of New
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's business community so they
 
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
truly do deserve the credit and they're
 
00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
reaping their uh just rewards for
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
that next up to protect consumers so our
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
consumer division takes lead on that
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
those are seven people in our department
 
00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
who all day every day that they are at
 
00:44:53.309 --> 00:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
work are taking in calls from consumers
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
we get a little over 6,000 calls I think
 
00:44:58.109 --> 00:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
a year that come into to the consumer
 
00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
division I'd say about 5,000 of those
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
6,000 are questions that consumers have
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
what does this mean in my policy what
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
does this term mean get a lot of
 
00:45:12.549 --> 00:45:12.559 align:start position:0%
questions about actual cash value lot of
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
questions about aftermarket parts a lot
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
of questions about eobs when you're
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
talking about health insurance insurance
 
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
is complex and as I say all the time
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
consumers generally know two things
 
00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:25.640 align:start position:0%
about insurance they pay the premiums
 
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
they definitely know that and the policy
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
is hanging out in the safe or The Shoe
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
Box in the closet with the rest of the
 
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
important papers that they hope they
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
never have to actually deal with or read
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
and then something happens in Insurance
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately when you need your
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
insurance policy it almost certainly
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
means that something bad has happened
 
00:45:48.549 --> 00:45:48.559 align:start position:0%
now they're in a heightened level of
 
00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
stress and they're trying to Wade
 
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
through a very complex document that
 
00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
really and truly they're taking a look
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
at for the first time and so
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
unsurprisingly that generates a lot of
 
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
questions we take those in we really do
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
encourage consumers to work with an
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
independent insurance agent not just so
 
00:46:09.549 --> 00:46:09.559 align:start position:0%
that they can work with that agent to
 
00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:12.200 align:start position:0%
get the best premiums
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
possible an independent agent could look
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
across the full insurance landscape and
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
really tailor a set of products that may
 
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
work best for that individual or that
 
00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
individual and their family but also
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
because that independent agent could be
 
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
a great resource to them to help them
 
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
again understand some of the more
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
complex terminology and Provisions
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
within their policy but for those who
 
00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
don't work with an agent we are here as
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
well so 5,000 as I've said are questions
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
the other thousand or so are formal
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
complaints against their insurance
 
00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
company the consumer division did a
 
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
really phenomenal job over the course of
 
00:46:50.589 --> 00:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
the last fiscal year they brought in
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
over $6 million in consumer restitution
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
which was Far and Away a record for the
 
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.510 align:start position:0%
which was Far and Away a record for the
Department

00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
not sure why that is I'll give the
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
credit to the team they're doing a good
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
job digging into the issues and being
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
aggressive on behalf of the consumer uh
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
which is great but they're obviously
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
continuing to do their good work and
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
then in addition we provide expertise
 
00:47:14.549 --> 00:47:14.559 align:start position:0%
and support that looks like data and
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
statistical analysis of health care
 
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
costs and premiums in New Hampshire we
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
analyze and administer the ACA as
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate which is to say how the
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
federal government asks us to do it and
 
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
then we have laws and rules that promote
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
financially sound principles and provide
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
consumer protection again a lot of that
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
work is done by our consumer division as
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
Jason thank you DJ just a couple quick
 
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
hits on this um slide here where we what
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
we do a collection of Premium taxes
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement penalties and fees we've got
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
a a a tax department with three
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
individuals that are focused on um
 
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
making making sure the right amount of
 
00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:01.559 align:start position:0%
taxes is is invoiced and collected they
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
and then they do a lot of auditing
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
related to what they've done there um
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
they also will collect the enforcement
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
penalties if the those are coming out of
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
either our enforcement unit or penalties
 
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
from for some other late payments or
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
that sort of item and then
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
um the the fees are also uh work through
 
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
our business unit as well so we have a
 
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
team of business units working on that
 
00:48:28.109 --> 00:48:28.119 align:start position:0%
they're all kind of collaborating
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
together to make sure we get the right
 
00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
amount of funds into the department um
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
as far as uh there's item on here about
 
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
participation once say we participated
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
in the legislative process well here we
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
are and one of those subcommittees that
 
00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
represent of hunt will we'll have will
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
certainly be a big part of that one and
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
are often over here DJ's going to get
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
into that in much more detail later and
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
we already uh covered anyc we jumped
 
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
ahead for that so thank you Keith turn
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
it back to
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
you very good so in terms of the
 
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
department and you the legislature as
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
those of you who have been on this
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
committee before know we'll come in and
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
provide Insurance expertise most of the
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
time that looks like one of our subject
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
matter experts coming in and providing
 
00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
to you some insight and some Reflections
 
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
on what they are thinking in terms of
 
00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
The Proposal before you so we'll do that
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
testimony we will assist legislative
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
services with um certainly fiscal notes
 
00:49:29.789 --> 00:49:29.799 align:start position:0%
drafting from time to time we really do
 
00:49:32.789 --> 00:49:32.799 align:start position:0%
work incredibly hard to function as a
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan unbiased resource anytime
 
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:38.799 align:start position:0%
that we provide a perspective on
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
something it is through the lens of what
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
the Department's mission is now I will
 
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
say that in the past there has been what
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
I think is some Fair criticism uh that
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
we've come in and officially stated our
 
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
position to be neutral that we're just
 
00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
here to provide some information and
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
then would proceed to provide testimony
 
00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
that very clearly made it such that we
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
were favoring one side or the other I
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
really am going to try to be far more
 
00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
upfront and candid about what we think
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
of some things just so that we're all
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
being on the level here uh one thing
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
that I will say is we may initially come
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
in and have no position on a piece of
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
legislation chairman hunt as he has uh
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
has a tendency to do we look at the
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
thing and say I think as he's already
 
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.390 align:start position:0%
thing and say I think as he's already
referenced

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
referenced
 
00:50:27.549 --> 00:50:27.559 align:start position:0%
earlier I understand what you're trying
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
to do here but what this bill does
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that so insurance department
 
00:50:33.309 --> 00:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
could you please take this and rewrite
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
the whole thing and get it so that it
 
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
does what the sponsor wants it to do and
 
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
so we'll go ahead and do that you know
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
if in the process of that we really do
 
00:50:44.589 --> 00:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
come around to saying you know this as a
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
result of this intensive collaboration
 
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor with the committee is
 
00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
now a proposal that we can really get
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
behind I do want to reserve the right to
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
change our official position for from
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
neutral to either uh in support uh or if
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
the bill takes a different turn with a
 
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
series of amendments to switch the
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
position to being an opposition
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
depending on which way it goes uh but I
 
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
am going to try to be and I've told my
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
team to really try to be far more
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
upfront and candid about what the
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
sentiments of the department are at the
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
at the outset so some of the folks that
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
you may see come through depending on
 
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
the subject matter uh Doug Bartlett who
 
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
is the director of our financial
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
regulation unit should there be a
 
00:51:30.349 --> 00:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
proposal that deals with how we monitor
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
the financial solvency of an insurance
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
company uh James Fox who is the director
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
of our property in casualty division
 
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
he'll be in if it's a PNC Bill and
 
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
Michelle Heaton will be a regular face
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
that you will see again judging by the
 
00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
number of bills I've seen coming forward
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see her quite a bit but she is
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
the director of our life and health unit
 
00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
so all of the health insurance bills
 
00:51:56.589 --> 00:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
that you'll deal with Michelle will be
 
00:51:59.069 --> 00:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
here to provide some expertise I think
 
00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
we hit the financial regulation piece
 
00:52:03.789 --> 00:52:03.799 align:start position:0%
between Keith and I but there's some
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
information there for you in writing and
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
I think we can turn to Keith for a
 
00:52:09.069 --> 00:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
little bit more of a dive into the
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
Property and
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
Casualty thank you commission so really
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to do is kind of talk
 
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
about both structure-wise our Property
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
and Casualty unit um as the commissioner
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned James Fox is the director of
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
that unit you'll hear from him
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
frequently our health director Michelle
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
Heaton you'll hear from her as well both
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
of the units are structured basically in
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
the same format in that each unit
 
00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
oversees a compliance team which again
 
00:52:34.589 --> 00:52:34.599 align:start position:0%
is the the pre-issue reviewing all the
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
forms and the applications that
 
00:52:38.829 --> 00:52:38.839 align:start position:0%
consumers will see kind of a pre-issue
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
compliance review there's also an
 
00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
Actuarial component to that so each team
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
has an Actuarial staff uh that Actuarial
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
is works with the compliance team and
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
looking at rates and forms to make sure
 
00:52:53.309 --> 00:52:53.319 align:start position:0%
that the products are priced according
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
to our state laws there's also a legal
 
00:52:59.950 --> 00:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
support unit that supports each division
 
00:53:02.109 --> 00:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
we refer to those uh attorneys as our
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
product CLI attorneys um each of those
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
has an expertise in the whether it be
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
Financial regulation or um Life and
 
00:53:11.549 --> 00:53:11.559 align:start position:0%
Health Products or property casualty
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
products each has an expertise that they
 
00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
add to their respective product Silo and
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
then lastly each unit has a market
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
conduct unit the market conduct unit is
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for uh post product issue
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement of our laws and regs such
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
that when our complaint division
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
identifies a particular issue or
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
trending practice or or or grievance or
 
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
issue within the industry the market
 
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
conduct team will go into the companies
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
essentially doing an operational audit
 
00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
um looking for systemic practices and
 
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
can U work with our enforcement division
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
to take action against those entities um
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
so each of those product divisions are
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
structured in the same way again
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
focusing on form review um ensuring a
 
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
competitive Marketplace um trans
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
transparency in premium development um
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
and ultimately holding carriers
 
00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
accountable for the way they conduct
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
themselves within our insurance market
 
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
and lastly that market conduct team is
 
00:54:09.309 --> 00:54:09.319 align:start position:0%
also making sure that claims are being
 
00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
properly so before I get into the life
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
and health Deep dive with you I
 
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned before that we are working
 
00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:27.230 align:start position:0%
mentioned before that we are working
with

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:54:29.549 --> 00:54:29.559 align:start position:0%
industry to assist them through what I
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
have termed as to be a hard market and I
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
just want to Define that very quickly
 
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
give you a very quick background as to
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
what is driving this particular hard
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
Market purely for the reason that I
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
think you're probably hearing from a lot
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
of your constituents complaints about
 
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
why their homeowners and auto insurance
 
00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:50.559 align:start position:0%
is going up let me explain to you a
 
00:54:53.069 --> 00:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
little bit of what is going on so the
 
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
term hard Market is an insurance term
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
which means that demand for particular
 
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
types of coverage is at traditional
 
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
levels or higher but access to that
 
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
coverage is more restricted it's a basic
 
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
Supply demand type Dynamic that where
 
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
the access to that coverage is being
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
tightened the cost for what remains is
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
obviously higher so why is that
 
00:55:22.109 --> 00:55:22.119 align:start position:0%
companies are being more careful and
 
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
more restrictive as to the types of risk
 
00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.430 align:start position:0%
more restrictive as to the types of risk
exposure

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
that they are exposing themselves to the
 
00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
reason for that and this is a pretty
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
unique hard Market are some things that
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
typically Drive hard markets things like
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
inflation things like interest rates uh
 
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:43.240 align:start position:0%
costs are going up on things now some of
 
00:55:46.029 --> 00:55:46.039 align:start position:0%
that over time will obviously Abate
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
inflation will eventually come down
 
00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
Insurance uh interest rates will
 
00:55:52.109 --> 00:55:52.119 align:start position:0%
eventually come down but there are some
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
things that we're going to have to get
 
00:55:57.309 --> 00:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
comfortable with being here for the long
 
00:55:59.710 --> 00:55:59.720 align:start position:0%
term so for
 
00:56:02.589 --> 00:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
example you know we've made great
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
Innovations in what we put in terms of
 
00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:07.799 align:start position:0%
Technologies into our vehicles and into
 
00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
our homes for a long time I'm very cheap
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
I was driving around in a car that
 
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have air conditioning in it I
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
didn't want to get it fixed I didn't
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
need it I rolled the windows down I'm
 
00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:20.200 align:start position:0%
cheap that way my wife on the other hand
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
has a car that gives her a back massage
 
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
as she's going up 93 she has different
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
priorities than I do point being is that
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
back massager is expensive and so when
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
it breaks it's obviously expensive to
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
get the parts to fix it the expertise
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
that's needed to do the work I've
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
obviously made more of a light-hearted
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
example there but all of the new safety
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
features that are now in vehicles and
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
all of those things are great we want
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
citizens to be as safe as they possibly
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
can be in their homes and in their
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles but again all of that
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
technology comes with a cost and I don't
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
see anyone CL clamoring to go back to
 
00:56:59.069 --> 00:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
the days of the Model T or the Fred
 
00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
Flintstone mobile so that technology is
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
going to be here to stay and so that's
 
00:57:07.029 --> 00:57:07.039 align:start position:0%
going to be a pretty uh
 
00:57:09.029 --> 00:57:09.039 align:start position:0%
consistent thing that puts some pressure
 
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
on premiums going forward but that's
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
manageable the thing that is more
 
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to directly impact is
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
that companies are seeing huge losses
 
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
across the country for catastrophic
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
weather events
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
and we are seeing data that is
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
undeniable that the frequency and
 
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
severity of these storms and they're not
 
00:57:38.349 --> 00:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
just storms there are other weather
 
00:57:38.359 --> 00:57:39.510 align:start position:0%
just storms there are other weather
related

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
related
 
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
catastrophes again not just the
 
00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:43.720 align:start position:0%
Hurricanes that hit Florida or the Gulf
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
Coast of the Carolinas it's also the
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
wildfires that eat up half of California
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
seemingly at the end of every summer and
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
beginning of every fall it is some of
 
00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
those bizarre weather phenomena that
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
take place in the mid West in the rocky
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
mountain region all of that creates a
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
lot of damage and obviously the
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
companies have to ensure that damage and
 
00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
it's very very expensive and we're
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
seeing more of that with greater
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
frequency and so that is driving some of
 
00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
this hard Market as well I'm going to be
 
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
bringing forward for your consideration
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
later in the term something that I think
 
00:58:20.589 --> 00:58:20.599 align:start position:0%
can help homeowners in particular get
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
through this because none of us
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
single-handedly have an influence on how
 
00:58:27.549 --> 00:58:27.559 align:start position:0%
we handle why these weather things are
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
going on but we can I think bring some
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
relief to bear and again we'll talk
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
about that a little bit later so all of
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
that coming together as one really is
 
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
causing a lot of companies to tighten up
 
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
on their underwriting number of them
 
00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
have stopped writing certain lines of
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
business and so again when you don't
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
have the same access to the coverages
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
that you've had in the past it drives up
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
premiums and so that's why a lot of
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
folks are saying I don't understand why
 
00:58:58.990 --> 00:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
my PR premiums went up $100 $200 from
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
last year I haven't put a claim in in 20
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
years as much as we like to think we're
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
the captains of our own destiny here in
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire insurance is a very
 
00:59:11.069 --> 00:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
interconnected industry interconnected
 
00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:13.720 align:start position:0%
across all 50 states but really
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
internationally speaking particularly
 
00:59:17.309 --> 00:59:17.319 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about reinsurance
 
00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:19.559 align:start position:0%
which is also a challenge that a lot of
 
00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
our insurance carriers are facing having
 
00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
trouble holding on to their reinsurer or
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
having their reinsurer in increase their
 
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
premiums which obviously has a downshift
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
cost onto the companies themselves so
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
some of these things will eventually
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
fles themselves out um other things
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
again will have to be prepared for for
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
the long term but that in a nutshell is
 
00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:44.039 align:start position:0%
why some of your constituents are seeing
 
00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
what they're seeing we always always
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
always encourage consumers again to work
 
00:59:51.029 --> 00:59:51.039 align:start position:0%
with an independent agent to shop their
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
coverage New Hampshire despite being a
 
00:59:58.349 --> 00:59:58.359 align:start position:0%
small state um has over 200 companies
 
01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
competing for homeowners insurance and
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
auto insurance coverage here in New
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so there are options out there
 
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:07.640 align:start position:0%
for consumers and again we encourage
 
01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:09.640 align:start position:0%
them to take advantage of that and to
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
shop around to see who might be able to
 
01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
give you a better price for the coverage
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
that you
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
need in terms of life and health again
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
Keith described kind of the model for
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
how these units work but we'll come in
 
01:00:25.029 --> 01:00:25.039 align:start position:0%
and talk about things that will impact
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
the large group Market the small group
 
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
Market the individual Market I'm pleased
 
01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:32.839 align:start position:0%
to say and we touted this quite heavily
 
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire's average Benchmark
 
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
premium is
 
01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:40.039 align:start position:0%
$325 which is the lowest in the nation
 
01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
per the Kaiser Family Foundation and
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
wallet Hub who did analysis of that
 
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
we're very very proud of that now people
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
ask how is this
 
01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
possible many different reasons for it I
 
01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
think the one that is most pertinent to
 
01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
all of you in this room is that we are
 
01:00:59.069 --> 01:00:59.079 align:start position:0%
very careful about the types of burdens
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
that we put on the backs of our insurers
 
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
we obviously want to ensure appropriate
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
consumer protection we want to ensure
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
that fundamental coverage is there for
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
conditions to be sure but we don't
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
typically see this legislature moving
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
forward with huge expensive burdensome
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
mandates and so all of that helps to
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
keep costs under control we also as a
 
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
state work very collaboratively with
 
01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.750 align:start position:0%
state work very collaboratively with
industry

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
industry
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
the reason being is appreciate the fact
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
that we have as I've said a very
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
competitive PNC Market in our individual
 
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
market for a state of 1.35 million
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
people or so we now have four players
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
competing in that market which is great
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
we just had a new market entrant for
 
01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
2025 well since so we now have four
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
players and representative hunt and I
 
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
can remember not all that long ago we
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
were worried about whether we were going
 
01:01:57.789 --> 01:01:57.799 align:start position:0%
to see a complete collapse of our
 
01:01:59.950 --> 01:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
individual Market which is to say all of
 
01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
the players are going to pull out of the
 
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
market but because all of us the
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
Executive Branch the legislative branch
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
across the board worked collaboratively
 
01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
with industry and gave them assurances
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
that we would work with them and bring
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
what tools that we had available to Bear
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
to get them through that rough patch we
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
not only preserve the market but we set
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
ourselves up for a lot of success both
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of cost and in terms of
 
01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
additional competition
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
that next we'll go over to Keith I think
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
you commissioner so as we talk about
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
other legislative initiatives we already
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned producers and adjusters that
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
$245,000 uh 245,000
 
01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
um producers agents Adjusters in the
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire additionally that
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
particular unit um is also responsible
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
for um conducting the licensing exam
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
ation of those agents um as well as the
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
continuing education of those agents um
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
with the Advent of and there are other
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
certain fees that are collected um in
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
association with those licenses as with
 
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
the Advent of Technology there have been
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
some developments over the last 18
 
01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
months in particular uh which we have
 
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
been able to more efficiently collect
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
some of those fees so there will be an
 
01:03:22.349 --> 01:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
introduction of some um bills which will
 
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
help see some of those fees reduced um
 
01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.559 align:start position:0%
in in recognition of those technology
 
01:03:27.559 --> 01:03:29.190 align:start position:0%
in in recognition of those technology
advances

01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
advances
 
01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
it I think we've hit all of the
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
materials on the next slide so we're
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
just going to skip over that I don't
 
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
want to run too long so the next two
 
01:03:38.589 --> 01:03:38.599 align:start position:0%
slides are contact information should
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
you need to get a hold of us some places
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
where you can direct consumers to some
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
sites that you can go to for additional
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
information you know again the last
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
thing that I'll stress is we really do
 
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
try to take a pragmatic and Common Sense
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
regulatory philosophy at the department
 
01:03:59.710 --> 01:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
and that's not anything that I can take
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
particular credit for that is an
 
01:04:04.269 --> 01:04:04.279 align:start position:0%
attitude and approach is developed in
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
the department over many many years and
 
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
people often ask me you why the
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
collaboration why try to work with the
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
companies to solve problems rather than
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
taking a more heavy regulatory hand and
 
01:04:17.789 --> 01:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
again the reason for that is appreciate
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire represents less than
 
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:21.640 align:start position:0%
one half of 1% of the total written
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
premium in the United States of
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
America people in the sea Suites in New
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
York City and Hartford Connecticut are
 
01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
not sitting in those boardrooms saying
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
to themselves you know what we've got to
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
do we've got to somehow break into that
 
01:04:35.549 --> 01:04:35.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Market there are Untold
 
01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
Financial windfalls to be had if we can
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
just get into that New Hampshire Market
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
no they want to do business in New
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because we are a good place to
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
do business we are a good risk as a
 
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
state we are a highly educated people we
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
make good decisions we are a safe state
 
01:04:56.269 --> 01:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:04:59.230 --> 01:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
you see all of the metrics and rankings
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
that the various organizations put out
 
01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire always fares right at
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
the top of the list in terms of best in
 
01:05:09.269 --> 01:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
all of those quality of life metrics and
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
that's the reason that companies want to
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
do business here and because we do
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
collaborate with them because I do have
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
the ability when there are small little
 
01:05:20.029 --> 01:05:20.039 align:start position:0%
things that come up to pick up the phone
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
and call the head of that company and
 
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
basically say knock it off please and
 
01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
they do
 
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
it helps us to address problems a lot
 
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
faster whether they be systematic
 
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
problems or whether they be a problem
 
01:05:34.589 --> 01:05:34.599 align:start position:0%
that's impacting one consumer and we're
 
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
able to quickly resolve that problem for
 
01:05:39.309 --> 01:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
that particular individual that
 
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
collaborative approach that pragmatic
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
Common Sense approach I think has served
 
01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
not only to best enforce the laws and
 
01:05:51.549 --> 01:05:51.559 align:start position:0%
the rules that that you all in the
 
01:05:53.309 --> 01:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
legislature have brought forward over
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
the years but the department has brought
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
forward as well
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
but again it also ensures that consumer
 
01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
protection mission is being accomplished
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
in the best manner
 
01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
possible so with that Mr chairman I'm
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
happy to take all of your questions I
 
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
apologize you know obviously I think
 
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
what we do is very very important I'm
 
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
never going to be as exciting as the
 
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
liquor and the lottery
 
01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
no it's uh it I think it's important
 
01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:21.640 align:start position:0%
point out is the diversity and uh and
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
the importance of all the things that
 
01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
the department does do that this
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
committee needs to know about um
 
01:06:27.599 --> 01:06:29.670 align:start position:0%
committee needs to know about um
question

01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
yes so I have I have two questions uh
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you're going to be
 
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
more uh proactive I guess maybe that's
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
not the right word uh give us more
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
information as to what your really your
 
01:06:45.309 --> 01:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
opinion is on things and I found that in
 
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
the past two years it's
 
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
been difficult when you don't give your
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
opinion so I appreciate that you're
 
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
going to do that but one thing I ask
 
01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.750 align:start position:0%
going to do that but one thing I ask
because

01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:06:59.950 --> 01:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
by now most of you know how I do stuff I
 
01:07:02.109 --> 01:07:02.119 align:start position:0%
really would like you to give us the
 
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
reasons why you have the position that
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
you have sure because that'll save me a
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
few hours in my no I I appreciate that
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative let me say this a unique
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
moment for me I've I've never been told
 
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
that I've been shy to give my opinion on
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
anything but I I want to know why the
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
second thing was when we ended last year
 
01:07:22.349 --> 01:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
and I think this is the right place to
 
01:07:23.549 --> 01:07:23.559 align:start position:0%
ask the
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
question uh and if I'm wrong then please
 
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
tell me uh and I have been participating
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
in it the ambulance study so when are we
 
01:07:35.309 --> 01:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
that really yeah excellent
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
excellent absolutely yeah we do have
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
legislation to couple of them couple of
 
01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
them couple bills yeah so I I yes
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
represent bars I have two quick
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
questions one so there I was uh very
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
torn I was asked to to sign onto an
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
ambulance uh pricing bill this year and
 
01:07:57.630 --> 01:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
decline because of that commission so I
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
take it that was probably a good move
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
yes okay awesome Yep so just very
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
briefly for those who are not here or
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
those who have been here representative
 
01:08:09.309 --> 01:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
hunt in particular know we have had a
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
very robust discussion over a very very
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
long period of time regarding ground
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
ambulance and at its core the issue is
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
while there are balance billing
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
protections at both the state and
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
federal level for nearly everything in
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
health insurance these days the Last
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
Frontier of medical services that do not
 
01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
have Balan billing protections for
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
consumers is ground ambulance and how
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
that comes about is long and short the
 
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers in the insurance
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
carriers are not able to come to an
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
agreement to get them in network they're
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
not able to agree as to what the rate
 
01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
schedule is going to be for the services
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
that they provide so as a result of that
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
they're out of network so the insurance
 
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
carrier will pay the provider whatever
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
amount they pay to an outof network
 
01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
provider so using round numbers for
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
example let's say you're a commercially
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
insured individual you need a ride to
 
01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
the ambulance that ride is
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
$1,000 the insurance carrier says we
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
reimburse not out of network providers
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
$200 and so what happens is the balance
 
01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:26.759 align:start position:0%
of that the $800 gets shipped off to the
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
consumer the consumer often times has no
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
idea what that bill is
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
for a lot of times it is a financial
 
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
stretch for them it's a real burden for
 
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
them and they can't understand why this
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
is happening when they have insurance
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
coverage uh and so we've tried to over
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
the years figure out how to address that
 
01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
and so where we landed at the end of
 
01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
last session was you all in the legisl
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
asked the department to conduct an
 
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
Actuarial study of what the appropriate
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
rates should be for commercial insurance
 
01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
carriers to give to providers for ground
 
01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
ambulance now appreciate and you'll see
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
this reflected in the report 80% or so
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
of ground ambulance rides are for
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
individuals who get their insurance
 
01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
coverage through one of the government
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
programs meaning either Medicare or
 
01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and as you know those rates are
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
fixed they're non-negotiable the federal
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
government sets the Medicare rates they
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
also set the Medicaid rates the state
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
has some play in that as well and I
 
01:10:41.189 --> 01:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
think in the last budget you in fact
 
01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
increased Medicaid rates for ground
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
ambulance a bit which was very very
 
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
helpful and so what you're left and what
 
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about are the 20% of those
 
01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
rides who are from individuals who have
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
commercial insurance coverage I will
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
tell you that the report reflects a lot
 
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
of what I
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
hypothesized would be the case when we
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
first launched this study which is to
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
say that carriers need to increase their
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
rates they need to bump those rates up
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
particularly for providers servicing
 
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
areas defined as rural or super rural
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
because those rides are less frequent
 
01:11:24.189 --> 01:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
but the distances are longer and the
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
providers have no less of an obligation
 
01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
to ensure an appropriate state of
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
Readiness but also the reality of it is
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's not as much as I think the
 
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.350 align:start position:0%
it's not as much as I think the
providers

01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
want and I think that again it comes
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
back to what I've said now for quite
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
some time yes some of the rates need to
 
01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
increase and that's reflected in the
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
report but if you want long-term
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
stability for those ambulance providers
 
01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
they need need to analyze their current
 
01:11:59.350 --> 01:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
business model and make adjustments to
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
their business model because at present
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
barring again some significant increase
 
01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
in Medicare or Medicaid rates it's just
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
not sustainable long term and what I
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
don't think is fair is for us to say
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
well because the providers are not
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
getting what they need from Medicare and
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to sustain their current
 
01:12:27.629 --> 01:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
operations what we need to do is to
 
01:12:27.639 --> 01:12:29.030 align:start position:0%
operations what we need to do is to
greatly

01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
greatly
 
01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
increase the costs onto the 20% of the
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
commercial Market to essentially
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
subsidize what they're not getting I
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's fair and again
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
if you were to go with some of the rates
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
that some of the providers have
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
suggested you are going to
 
01:12:51.310 --> 01:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
see very significant premium increases
 
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
for consumers which again is not
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
something we want to see given the
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
advantageous position the state
 
01:12:59.669 --> 01:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
currently sits in having some of the
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
lowest average monthly premiums in the
 
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
nation so that's a little bit of the
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
background there that's a little bit of
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
a sneak peek as to what you're going to
 
01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
see in the report when it comes out this
 
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon further question okay I I I
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to go down a rabbit hole but
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
just a make it a quick question are you
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
actively involved with the negotiation
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
between Anthem and St Joseph's
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
actively I don't know how to define that
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
exactly so
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly involved I'm certainly
 
01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
involved and again I'll give a little
 
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
bit of a background although I think
 
01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
it's been pretty public so Anthem and St
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
Joseph Hospital in nashille have had a
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
very very difficult time negotiating a
 
01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
new contract for St Joe to remain in
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
network with
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
Anthem typically and over our history as
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
a department we very very rarely get
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
directly involved in a negotiation
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
between a provider and a carrier number
 
01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
of different reasons for that not the
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
least of which is because if you were to
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
give me some sort of authority to
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
arbitrate or mediate these disputes uh
 
01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
we'd have to add an additional unit to
 
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
the department to handle all of the
 
01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
differences of opinion that you know
 
01:14:16.629 --> 01:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
crop up in these
 
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
negotiations um but also because there's
 
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
an inherent unfairness in the sense that
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
when I've got those two parties in the
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
room I regulate the insurance carrier I
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
don't regulate the provider and so that
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier in that Dynamic is at
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
a disadvantage and that's just not fair
 
01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
to them in this case however and I'm
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
very very narrowly defining why we took
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
the action that we did you can label
 
01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
this as the veton cord Doctrine if you'd
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
like uh but obviously Anthem is the
 
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
state's largest insurance carrier Nashua
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
is new Hampshire's second largest
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
community St Joseph is a huge player in
 
01:15:02.629 --> 01:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
the not only in nsha but the surrounding
 
01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
communities as well but the biggest
 
01:15:07.950 --> 01:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
issue for me was the dispute was coming
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
at a time when we are on the very tail
 
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
end of the open enrollment period And so
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have made decisions as
 
01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
to which coverage they've chosen for
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
themselves and their families on the
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
assumption that St Joseph hospital will
 
01:15:26.629 --> 01:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
be in network with Anthem because when
 
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
they looked at the different plans they
 
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
obviously looked a lot about what the
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
premium looks like and the deductible
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
but also what the network looks like
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
they obviously want to be in network
 
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
with the providers that are closest to
 
01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
them or the providers that they have
 
01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
long-standing relationships with and so
 
01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:44.990 align:start position:0%
long-standing relationships with and so
for

01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
this potential fissure to take place at
 
01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
this particular time I thought was
 
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
pretty problematic and we were hearing
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
from a number of you senators as well
 
01:15:59.229 --> 01:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
two Governor's offices uh that they were
 
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
very very concerned about this situation
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
and so later this afternoon
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
representatives from Anthem and St
 
01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
Joseph will come over to the department
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
and I will share with them the resources
 
01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
that the department has uh that we can
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
make available to them to hopefully get
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
them a little bit closer to an agreement
 
01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
people ask me what those resources are
 
01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
we have a very comprehensive all claims
 
01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
database that could potenti po Al be
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
very helpful we have a data analytics
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
unit my math nerds as I affectionately
 
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
refer to the maass uh who can help
 
01:16:34.629 --> 01:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
crunch numbers for for them we can be a
 
01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:37.400 align:start position:0%
neutral Arbiter of information track
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
some things down so we can be helpful
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
that way but obviously I do want to
 
01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
share with them some of what I've been
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
hearing from citizens and some of what
 
01:16:49.709 --> 01:16:49.719 align:start position:0%
I've been hearing from you because it
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know this has obviously created a
 
01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
great deal of anxiety for a lot of
 
01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
people and again it's a really tough
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
time for this all to be coming to a head
 
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
so I am going to bring them in for a
 
01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
conversation and hopefully that proves
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
fruitful in ultimately getting them back
 
01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
into an
 
01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
agreement representative pelli has a
 
01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
question so representative Burrows and I
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
participated in a short discussion about
 
01:17:20.189 --> 01:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
one very important issue here in New
 
01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is mental health um
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
accessibility to provider accessibility
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
and we found out that you already had a
 
01:17:32.629 --> 01:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
very robust U study group um that was
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
already looking into that issue so I
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to know if you were able and it
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
was comprehensive you had a lot of
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
different um organizations and and
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
resources available so we didn't want to
 
01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
duplicate that work so I wanted to know
 
01:17:51.149 --> 01:17:51.159 align:start position:0%
if um your your commission um completed
 
01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
that work if there was a uh results
 
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
published any conclusions and if so
 
01:17:58.629 --> 01:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
where we could find that information out
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
sure so the department about a year or
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
so ago brought back its Behavioral
 
01:18:06.629 --> 01:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
Health advisory committee and so it's a
 
01:18:08.669 --> 01:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
standing committee of a broad array of
 
01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholders they include the insurance
 
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
carriers they include Advocates
 
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
providers legislators members of the
 
01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:17.560 align:start position:0%
public uh who come together and share
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
with the Department different Trends and
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
different issues that they are seeing in
 
01:18:25.229 --> 01:18:25.239 align:start position:0%
terms of access to behavioral health
 
01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
services and treatments and it drives a
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
lot of what we focus our attention on
 
01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
and it also helps us to get some
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
feedback from them on some different
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
legislative proposals that you will all
 
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
bring forward to us or have a
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
conversation with us about that you're
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
thinking about bringing forward no study
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
per se because that work is ongoing
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's a standing group within the
 
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
department and we're not letting those
 
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
guys go anytime soon uh but obviously we
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
did a lot of work work for the
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
legislature this summer in Fall with the
 
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
study committees that you all brought
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
forward I thought you all did a lot of
 
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
good work it was a lot of excellent
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
information I think we were able to dig
 
01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
into and better understand together but
 
01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
if there's a particular issue or
 
01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
particular concern that you are hearing
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
from your constituents or you're hearing
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
in general I'll bring them to me and
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
I'll put it on the agenda for that
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
advisory committee to take a look at and
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
share their perspective and if we need
 
01:19:28.629 --> 01:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
to do a deeper dive or do additional
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
work into that issue we will certainly
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
we will certainly do that I will tell
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
you that mental health is my number one
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
priority as commissioner I take it
 
01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.310 align:start position:0%
priority as commissioner I take it
incredibly

01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
incredibly
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
seriously in fact we were successful in
 
01:19:45.629 --> 01:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
getting a $40,000 Grant from the NAIC
 
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
for the Northeast Zone to do a mental
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
health parody compliance Symposium which
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
is going to bring together Regulators
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
from the north northeast states NAIC
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
defines Northeast as the District of
 
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
Columbia all of the states going north
 
01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
up to Maine and so that will be I think
 
01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
next week or the week after we're going
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
to bring all of the mental health Mia
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
experts together in those States and
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
share best practices um again I think
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
over the course of the term we'll talk a
 
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
lot about mental health but there are
 
01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
some areas within Mia compliance that
 
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
remain incredibly difficult for
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
Regulators to get their arms around
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
particularly the non-quantitative
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
treatment limits some states have
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
developed great tools to be able to
 
01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
assess whether there's parity in those
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
areas and we want to engage in my
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
favorite kind of R&amp;D which is to rip off
 
01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:40.229 align:start position:0%
favorite kind of R&amp;D which is to rip off
and

01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
duplicate uh anything that another state
 
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
is doing that is working really really
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
well we want to make sure that we're
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
bringing that to Bear here in New
 
01:20:50.669 --> 01:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire again to the benefit of the
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
people of this
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
state repr Teresa
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
so I have a um basic question uh based
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
on the presentation that you gave it
 
01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
seems like you have two departments one
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
that takes care of the consumer rights
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
and consumer
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
interests and uh protects them and the
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
second which also helps the insurance
 
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
businesses like you know you know
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
processing their fraud cases and etc etc
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sure your department must be getting
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
Revenue based on because you're helping
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
them processing those so my question is
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
that uh you have two divisions one
 
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
getting to the interest of consumers and
 
01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
other getting to the interest of the
 
01:21:37.709 --> 01:21:37.719 align:start position:0%
businesses how do you walk a fine line
 
01:21:39.629 --> 01:21:39.639 align:start position:0%
between two div these two divisions
 
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
because some of the cases I'm sure it
 
01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
comes where uh you can be biased either
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
way or you can make opinion or you can
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
make judgment uh based on one fight or
 
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
the other so how do your department walk
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
a fine line sure so I I think though the
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
presentation may have made it appear as
 
01:21:59.310 --> 01:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
though there are some units within the
 
01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
department that are siloed off I can
 
01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
assure you that all of the units work
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
incredibly well together there's
 
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
interconnectivity within everything that
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
we do as an example you know our
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
consumer division is obviously the most
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
public facing unit within the department
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of talking with consumers every
 
01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
day working with the public through
 
01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
issues but if they begin to see a number
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
of call s that are coming in related to
 
01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
the same issue related to the same
 
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
carrier that information gets passed
 
01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
along to one of the units so whether
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
it's a PNC thing that they're seeing or
 
01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's a health insurance thing
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
that they're seeing it'll get passed off
 
01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
to that unit and the market conduct
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
teams within that unit will then take it
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
and begin to assess whether or not there
 
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be an exam and let me just say
 
01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
people think that the most uncomfortable
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
thing that the department can do to an
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
insurance company is to find them that's
 
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
actually not true the most uncomfortable
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
thing we could do to an insurance
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
carrier is to put them through a market
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
conduct exam and what that looks like is
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
again let's say we've identified a
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
particular issue taking place with a
 
01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:14.199 align:start position:0%
particular carrier or a particular set
 
01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
of carriers we will launch a market
 
01:23:19.629 --> 01:23:19.639 align:start position:0%
conduct exam and we will embed our
 
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
examiners in that company and we will
 
01:23:27.390 --> 01:23:27.400 align:start position:0%
say we want to see 2500 or so
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
files picked at
 
01:23:33.229 --> 01:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
random again targeted a specific issue
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
and they will go through each and every
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
one of those files and along the way
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
they're marking all of the areas where
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
there have been a violation of state law
 
01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
or a violation of State Rule and by the
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
way we charge the companies for the
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
pleasure of hosting us which can get
 
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
very very expensive and then at the end
 
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
of that process when we've tallied up
 
01:23:57.790 --> 01:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
all of the violations that we've
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
discovered then we find them it could be
 
01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
a very very expensive proposition now
 
01:24:04.709 --> 01:24:04.719 align:start position:0%
again I'm being a little bit
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
light-hearted here the attitude of the
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
department over many years and my
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
attitude as commissioner I'm not looking
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
to be punitive I'm just trying to
 
01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
correct behavior I'm trying to ensure
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
that we are addressing the problem or
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
the experience the negative experience
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
that the consumer is having sure
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
we will find companies because we've got
 
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
to hold them accountable and we want to
 
01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:31.400 align:start position:0%
ensure that they are adequately taking
 
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
the steps they need to take to fix
 
01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:35.719 align:start position:0%
whatever it is we've asked them to fix
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
and it's not just a fine there's a
 
01:24:39.870 --> 01:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan that will also
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
accompany the end of an exam as well and
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
typically what I try to do is to put a
 
01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
really large fine suspended over that
 
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan to say you're
 
01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
going to have a period of time to make
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
these changes make sure you make them
 
01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
because if not over a year or two period
 
01:24:58.669 --> 01:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
we'll go ahead and assess that full fine
 
01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
and you're not going to want that um so
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
we we do really do try to work together
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of bias the law is always the
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
anchor the law is always the tether for
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
us as a department what does the law
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
what does the rule set forth and we look
 
01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
to apply that in the most appropriate
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
manner possible and so sometimes the
 
01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:22.280 align:start position:0%
result of that will be something that is
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
favorable to the company and sometimes
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
that is a result that will be favorable
 
01:25:29.109 --> 01:25:29.119 align:start position:0%
to the consumer and if the outcome is
 
01:25:31.149 --> 01:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
not one that you want to see you always
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to bring forward a
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation to change the law
 
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
and if you change the law I'll enforce
 
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.030 align:start position:0%
and if you change the law I'll enforce
that

01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
one fair enough thank you so uh
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
representative pusk would like the last
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
word thank you Mr chair um DJ and I go
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
back along long way uh as
 
01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh and as uh
 
01:25:58.590 --> 01:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
a rep in dairy uh Dairy has a lot of
 
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
people and we have 10 reps but a lot of
 
01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
the folks know uh that I deal with
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
insurance problems in the past two
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
years uh I've had two
 
01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
constituents uh notify me that they were
 
01:26:14.590 --> 01:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
having problems with their insurance
 
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
companies I sent out an email to DJ
 
01:26:22.109 --> 01:26:22.119 align:start position:0%
personally and it was acknowledged
 
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
within a half hour that that he would
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
have somebody take care of it a couple
 
01:26:31.109 --> 01:26:31.119 align:start position:0%
of days later my constituent got a hold
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
of me and said I don't know how you did
 
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
it but the problem's being taken care of
 
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
and this is typical of my contacts with
 
01:26:46.109 --> 01:26:46.119 align:start position:0%
the insurance people uh they do great
 
01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
work and uh they do it quickly and my
 
01:26:55.149 --> 01:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
constituents love you guys so thank you
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
for the work you're doing well I
 
01:26:59.310 --> 01:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate that very much representative

P we take customer service very very
 
01:27:04.109 --> 01:27:04.119 align:start position:0%
seriously there are advantages and
 
01:27:06.109 --> 01:27:06.119 align:start position:0%
disadvantages to being a small state I
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
think one of the advantages that people
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
should have living in a small state is
 
01:27:12.109 --> 01:27:12.119 align:start position:0%
that when you have a problem you should
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
be able to get an individual on the
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
phone or by email very very quickly to
 
01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
address your issue we're a small team
 
01:27:24.149 --> 01:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
but we're very a good team I'm biased of
 
01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
of course but we really do try to be
 
01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
very Nimble and turn things around very
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
very quickly uh for constituents and I'm
 
01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:34.040 align:start position:0%

Department

01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
and again we are very privileged to have
 
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
good morning good
 
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
morning I'll just so I have a handout
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
that's going around I put a few extras
 
01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:52.550 align:start position:0%
that's going around I put a few extras
over

01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
there I don't want to spend a lot of
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
time going through the handout but it
 
01:28:58.270 --> 01:28:58.280 align:start position:0%
just gives some high level information
 
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
about the banking Department
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
um good morning for the record my name
 
01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
is Amelia galerian I'm the bank
 
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the State of New
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this feels very close to me so
 
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to push it away um it has to
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
be okay okay I'll put it close um it
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
won't wait I'm happy to be here to give
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
you some high level information about
 
01:29:21.070 --> 01:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
the banking department but most
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
importantly I'm here to introduce my
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
team because they will be the people who
 
01:29:26.109 --> 01:29:26.119 align:start position:0%
you will be seeing and interacting with
 
01:29:27.310 --> 01:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
and I feel like that's the most
 
01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
important part that you all know who you
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
can reach out to at the banking
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
Department if you have an issue so I'll
 
01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
get started with that so to my left is
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh Deputy Commissioner Mike moranti he
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
most frequently will be watching you on
 
01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
camera he will probably not be here too
 
01:29:42.430 --> 01:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
much but if you have an issue he's
 
01:29:44.189 --> 01:29:44.199 align:start position:0%
available to be reached out to but he is
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
the one who usually is watching the
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
hearings going in the background uh to
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
my right is general counsel Seth saraki
 
01:29:53.229 --> 01:29:53.239 align:start position:0%
he's probably the face you're going to
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
see the most generally either him or his
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
Deputy Bob will come in and testify
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
about legislation on behalf of the
 
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
banking department so he's somebody who
 
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a lot of um behind
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
me is uh public information officer Ian
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
Clark he tracks all of our legislation
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
for us similarly he will also be
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
watching on the camera probably won't be
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
here too too much but he is uh our
 
01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
primary legislative tracker and always
 
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:19.400 align:start position:0%
keeps us well informed about what's
 
01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:20.070 align:start position:0%
keeps us well informed about what's
going

01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
on uh and probably watching on camera
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
right now is Deputy General Council Bob
 
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
and birdie who could not be here today
 
01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
for health reasons but he is another
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
face who you will be seeing
 
01:30:34.030 --> 01:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
here um so to look at my hand oh do you
 
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:36.280 align:start position:0%
have a question yeah can you make sure
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
when you're done you can yes the
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
non-microscopic version yes I can I can
 
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
provide that I apologize
 
01:30:46.510 --> 01:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
really I had it even smaller when it was
 
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
a slide in the slideshow and I was like
 
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
this is not going to work um so I'm
 
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
happy I can provide this whole thing to
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
you digitally so you can have it thank
 
01:30:57.229 --> 01:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
you yeah I apologize there's no good way
 
01:31:00.430 --> 01:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
to give the give the hand out with that
 
01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
um I apologize so uh to go into the
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
handout um the first slide is the
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
mission of the department uh the summary
 
01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
of that slide is we are consumer
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
protection focused regulatory agency
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
that supervises the financial services
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
sector so we regulate banks credit
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
unions trust companies and um several
 
01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
different types of licensed Consumer
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
Credit entities so money transmitters
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
think PayPal Western Union we regulate
 
01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
small loan lenders um which includes
 
01:31:34.510 --> 01:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
title lenders and payday lenders we
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
regulate mortgage companies of all
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
shapes and sizes so Mortgage Services
 
01:31:42.109 --> 01:31:42.119 align:start position:0%
mortgage brokers Etc um and we regulate
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
debt adjusters so those are the folks
 
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
who negotiate um debt payments on behalf
 
01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:48.510 align:start position:0%
who negotiate um debt payments on behalf
of

01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:51.719 align:start position:0%
consumers so that's a little bit of our
 
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
um Mission um we supervise those
 
01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
entities in three major ways we conduct
 
01:31:59.070 --> 01:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
examinations we monitor off-site data
 
01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's submitted To Us by those entities
 
01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
and we investigate consumer complaints
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
the next slide talks a little bit gives
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit more detail about the
 
01:32:09.109 --> 01:32:09.119 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the department um we
 
01:32:11.229 --> 01:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
have 45 State chartered trust companies
 
01:32:13.870 --> 01:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
that regulate 17 State chartered Banks
 
01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
um we do use the terms licensed and
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
chartered a lot when we come and present
 
01:32:20.109 --> 01:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
to you and so um the difference between
 
01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
a license and a chartered entity is the
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
license is renew every year so all the
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
and we have roughly well we have over
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
7,000 lenses but some of those are
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
individual mortgage Originators um but
 
01:32:35.629 --> 01:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
we have about 2,000 is that we are
 
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for examining and take
 
01:32:40.990 --> 01:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints on
 
01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
Etc moving right along um I have a slide
 
01:32:46.590 --> 01:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
that talks pretty high level about
 
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
examination our examination and
 
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement Authority additionally
 
01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
investigating into consumer complaints
 
01:32:54.510 --> 01:32:54.520 align:start position:0%
um what you you need to know is that
 
01:32:56.350 --> 01:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
entities that are regulated by us if
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
they're chartered by us we regul we go
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
into to examine them about every 18
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
months there are some exceptions we can
 
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
go in sooner if we need to so that's the
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
banks credit unions and Trust companies
 
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
we go in and look at every 18 months
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
routinely and more often if there's an
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
issue um we also work with our federal
 
01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
counterparts a lot so the FDIC the ncua
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
for credit unions sometimes the cfpb um
 
01:33:21.109 --> 01:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
all the oh and the Federal Reserve so
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
all of those Federal entities come in
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
and do examin with us um the licensed
 
01:33:27.629 --> 01:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
entities that I talked about the money
 
01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
transmitters mortgage companies Etc are
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
um examined every 24 months give or take
 
01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
unless there's an issue if it's a new
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
company we go in a little sooner Etc um
 
01:33:39.310 --> 01:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
when it comes to an enforcement action
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
there we have several different types of
 
01:33:43.470 --> 01:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions we do um the main
 
01:33:46.830 --> 01:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
thing takeaway is that we part of being
 
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
I think a good regulator and really
 
01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
effectively um protecting consumers is
 
01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
promoting a vibrant Financial Services
 
01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
sector so that the companies they have
 
01:33:57.390 --> 01:33:57.400 align:start position:0%
lots of options of who they can go to
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
and that they're safe and well regulated
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
um so we try not to be punitive we try
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
to work with companies to bring them
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
into compliance that's really the goal
 
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
of any sort of enforcement action that
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
we do um you can get a flavor for the
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions on our website
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
they're all public um we did revamp our
 
01:34:14.189 --> 01:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
website in the last couple of years and
 
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's very user friendly I think or at
 
01:34:18.270 --> 01:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
least much more than it used to be so
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's the examination enforcement um
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
slide we also have a slide about how the
 
01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:25.400 align:start position:0%
bank Bing department is funded in a
 
01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
nutshell we're a self-funded agency so
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
we get an appropriation from the
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
legislature and then over the course of
 
01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year we collect fines and
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
fees and at the end of the year an
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
assessment if we need to to um pay back
 
01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
that appropriation
 
01:34:45.310 --> 01:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
essentially that's that slide um we also
 
01:34:46.830 --> 01:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
have a strategic plan which I put on
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
here again it's microscopic I apologize
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
but I did include our website where you
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
can go read the full thing um it also
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's the 20 it ends in 2025 so we're
 
01:34:59.790 --> 01:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
getting ready to do a new strategic plan
 
01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
um and you can go and look it we've
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
tried to update it as we go the version
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
on our website so you can see what we've
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
accomplished on that strategic plan so I
 
01:35:11.229 --> 01:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
think that's I'm pretty proud of that um
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of upcoming and ongoing
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
initiatives right now we're obviously
 
01:35:17.550 --> 01:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
developing our budget um we've submitted
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
it and we're obviously working we worked
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
with Governor sununu's team and now um
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
governor elect aot's team te to uh move
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
forward with a budget submission um
 
01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to do ongoing legislative
 
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
tracking we don't have any um
 
01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
legislative initiatives that were
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
promoting this year but we will be in
 
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
here on other things that I'm sure you
 
01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
will hear about from the various
 
01:35:40.109 --> 01:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
interest groups I believe the banking uh
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
Association has one as well as the
 
01:35:43.709 --> 01:35:43.719 align:start position:0%
credit union Association so we will be
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
in here testifying about those and
 
01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
others I'm sure um another big
 
01:35:50.430 --> 01:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
initiative that we're undertaking is
 
01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
modernization of the banking
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
Department's um Data Systems
 
01:35:57.390 --> 01:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
so we became fully well so first we
 
01:35:59.229 --> 01:35:59.239 align:start position:0%
reduced our office footprint to save
 
01:36:01.950 --> 01:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
money so then we got rid of all of our
 
01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:04.360 align:start position:0%
paper files and went paperless and now
 
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to move off of antiquated
 
01:36:10.590 --> 01:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
like Microsoft Access databases and into
 
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
something slightly more modern perhaps
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
moving into the 201s of SharePoint so we
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
are we have that modernization effort
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
well underway and it feels really good
 
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
to be moving in that direction so that's
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
a big initiative um that we're working
 
01:36:27.149 --> 01:36:27.159 align:start position:0%
really hard at um and additionally I
 
01:36:29.070 --> 01:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
always put a plugin whenever I go out
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
into the world that we are recruiting um
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
because we are always recruiting even
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
when we don't have open positions we're
 
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
trying to recruit um I think we do
 
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
important work it's a good team to work
 
01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
with it's one of the good things that I
 
01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
think about the banking department is
 
01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
not only we have a hard job we have a
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
serious job an important job but we got
 
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
also are a good team to work with so
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
plug in for my people and also if you
 
01:36:54.669 --> 01:36:54.679 align:start position:0%
know an attorney send them our way thank
 
01:36:58.590 --> 01:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
you um so that's kind of at a very very
 
01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
high level um I don't want to slow down
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
the works here I'm happy to answer any
 
01:37:02.639 --> 01:37:04.590 align:start position:0%
the works here I'm happy to answer any
questions

01:37:04.590 --> 01:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh we yes represent spe
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
this is just for my own information
 
01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
because sry this is my own information
 
01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
because I just don't know enough about
 
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
this do you have any jurisdiction with
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
respect to National Banks and anything
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
that they do not really okay um so they
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
are regulated by the OCC or the FDIC or
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
the F frb depending on their choices
 
01:37:34.590 --> 01:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
that they've made in terms of Regulation
 
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
um we will take a we if we get a
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
Consumer complaint about them we do
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
forward them to the OCC um that's really
 
01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
the extent of our Authority we don't
 
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
have any real enforcement authority over
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
them or anything like that because you
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
usually get one or two bills that tell
 
01:37:49.629 --> 01:37:49.639 align:start position:0%
us we should do something to them but I
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
didn't think we had any access to be
 
01:37:54.510 --> 01:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
able to do that no that I mean it would
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
depend on the nature of the bill but
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of federal law regulating
 
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
them they're heavily regulated obviously
 
01:38:02.669 --> 01:38:02.679 align:start position:0%
entities um so you do have to watch out
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
for preemption issues but it would
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
depend on what it
 
01:38:09.629 --> 01:38:09.639 align:start position:0%
is so we like State Ted Banks we do like
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
State Char Banks good because then then
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
we can regulate
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
them anybody else have a question
 
01:38:23.189 --> 01:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
yes yeah uh do you have any uh details
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
on the mobile banking frauds because
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
there are those frauds are going up
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
overall right so I I really like to see
 
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
the legislation or any kind of policies
 
01:38:37.709 --> 01:38:37.719 align:start position:0%
you have the directions you need to give
 
01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
in any of your website or wherever we
 
01:38:42.189 --> 01:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
can see it because I have experienced
 
01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
that and many consumers are experiencing
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
it because they are not very
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable and we are not giving
 
01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
enough guidelines to them so I would
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
like to see some kind of a
 
01:38:57.229 --> 01:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
more Deep dive in that area and I would
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
like just let me know if you have it and
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
I can give some kind of a inputs with
 
01:39:04.750 --> 01:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
little bit of my experience yeah that
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
that would be great so um one of the
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
things that you'll see in our strategic
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
plan if you go and look at it is we're
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
trying to increase our consumer Outreach
 
01:39:13.950 --> 01:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
so we're always looking for educa
 
01:39:16.030 --> 01:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
financial education opportunities to go
 
01:39:17.709 --> 01:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
out into the community and work with
 
01:39:19.629 --> 01:39:19.639 align:start position:0%
people and provide education so I would
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
love to speak with you offline um about
 
01:39:23.229 --> 01:39:23.239 align:start position:0%
anything you know any ideas you have for
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
that that um right now our current
 
01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
education so uh oops I'm drawing a Brank
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
on whether it's February or April I
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
don't know quite why April Financial
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
Empowerment month April wow um I
 
01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
apologize April is financial empowerment
 
01:39:40.830 --> 01:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
month so um right now our focus is on um
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
kind of educating young people in
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
financial services but we've also done
 
01:39:47.709 --> 01:39:47.719 align:start position:0%
outreaches to elderly through um working
 
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
with the um Meals on Wheels and Ian is
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
actually our Point person on the
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
Outreach efforts as well
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
so I would love to if there's a target
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
audience that needs Financial education
 
01:39:59.470 --> 01:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
I always want to hear about it so please
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
I would like to see what kind of uh
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
content you have first yeah like if it
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
is like needs to be modified or needs to
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely because that's very important
 
01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
right now those things are getting
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
changed and the people who wants to hack
 
01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
the system they are really going after
 
01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
the people who doesn't know much about
 
01:40:19.870 --> 01:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
it and the money is money if it's gone
 
01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
it's gone it's gone yeah it's a
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
challenge so that is something we
 
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
actively deal with um we um did some
 
01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
legislation a few years ago with the
 
01:40:30.589 --> 01:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
bankers Association to have a um
 
01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
vulnerable person's um Financial abuse
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
Reporting System put into place um we
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
just get copied on those because
 
01:40:40.990 --> 01:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't have jurisdiction
 
01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
over the bad actor because usually the
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
bank helps the consumer identify it and
 
01:40:47.310 --> 01:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
then they have to report it to law
 
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement but now we get copied on all
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
of those so we do have some insight into
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
that um but those are fraud and you know
 
01:40:58.830 --> 01:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
abusive we'll take it offline yeah
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely I'm happy
 
01:41:03.629 --> 01:41:03.639 align:start position:0%
to and also some of those issues are
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
addressed by the consumer protection act
 
01:41:07.950 --> 01:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
yeah depending on the nature in terms of
 
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.629 --> 01:41:15.639 align:start position:0%
afternoon any other
 
01:41:19.109 --> 01:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent mcky uh yes
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
under the uh how the banking department
 
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
is funded you've got two buckets
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
I honestly don't know what CCD means oh
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry maybe I took that a it's
 
01:41:30.669 --> 01:41:30.679 align:start position:0%
consumer credit okay Consumer Credit
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
Division and then on your uh your your
 
01:41:38.589 --> 01:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
people page s so13 what does that refer
 
01:41:41.070 --> 01:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
oh that's um how the state characterizes
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
each position this is we have so many
 
01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:44.719 align:start position:0%
different orc charts to choose from I
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
apologize it it connects to the division
 
01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
of personnel for their job titles okay
 
01:41:52.030 --> 01:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
thank you occupational codes he used to
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
work at dop there this um what's the s
 
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
standard occupational codes got
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
you actually while you're still here
 
01:42:07.709 --> 01:42:07.719 align:start position:0%
okay um so to talk about the two
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
departments we just heard from the
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
insurance department and the banking
 
01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
Department uh and you would say gee you
 
01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
know well how how did it come to be that
 
01:42:19.470 --> 01:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
these are Commerce because at one point
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
in time this was just known as the banks
 
01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
committee you have picture of the old
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
Bank committee and so I would emphasize
 
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
the the name that we don't say too often
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
and that is consumer protection is our
 
01:42:35.790 --> 01:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
charge and um this
 
01:42:38.189 --> 01:42:38.199 align:start position:0%
committee uh it's getting on about 20
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
years ago um had a uh a train wreck of
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
around the issue of consumer
 
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
protection and because we have a
 
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
consumer protection
 
01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
statute uh but that in that statute uh
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
um we had four
 
01:42:59.589 --> 01:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
exemptions banking Insurance Securities
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
and public
 
01:43:03.589 --> 01:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
utilities and the question then comes
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
into who was in who is covered and who
 
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
was not
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
covered uh the train wreck actually kill
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
a aot was attorney general at the time
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
and uh and and the issue was that a
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
lensey which was auto
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
dealers claimed that they were exempt
 
01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
from the consumer protection act because
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
they were licensed by the bank
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
Department to do
 
01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:30.910 align:start position:0%
Department to do
mortgage

01:43:30.910 --> 01:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
mortgage
 
01:43:33.589 --> 01:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
documents so at that point in time we
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
knew we had we had a problem because
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
that was not the intent of legisl we
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
knew we had to to fix this and uh this
 
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
committee this Commerce Committee came
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
up with a
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
solution and the solution was does the
 
01:43:54.030 --> 01:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner whether the bank Insurance
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities or Securities do they
 
01:43:58.750 --> 01:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
have the power of
 
01:44:01.709 --> 01:44:01.719 align:start position:0%
restitution for the consumer if the
 
01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
consumer being get
 
01:44:07.229 --> 01:44:07.239 align:start position:0%
screwed lightly that we want them to be
 
01:44:10.750 --> 01:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
able to make the consumer whole and
 
01:44:11.950 --> 01:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
that's really what the consumer
 
01:44:14.830 --> 01:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
protection act its purpose is and we'll
 
01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
be discussing that in the afternoon but
 
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's important I I want to bring back to
 
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that the two departments I
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
would say the the banking Department was
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
really easy we got that the consumer
 
01:44:29.470 --> 01:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
protect adding consumer protection into
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
their statute was a piece of cake
 
01:44:34.270 --> 01:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
insurance was not they they they left
 
01:44:36.910 --> 01:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
the room so I could say this right they
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
it was a it was a long drawn out fight
 
01:44:42.669 --> 01:44:42.679 align:start position:0%
um the public utilities companies uh
 
01:44:45.550 --> 01:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
country uh companies always had it um
 
01:44:47.310 --> 01:44:47.320 align:start position:0%
because it was called
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
expungement and which I love that word
 
01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
but no we don't we didn't we weren't
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
going to pick that word up that was a
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
20th century you know 19th century word
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
um and and securities had it when the
 
01:45:00.510 --> 01:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
division was created so uh when when DJ
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
says it was amazed about how much
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
consumer protection they uh that he was
 
01:45:09.589 --> 01:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
able to able to enforce um and but that
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
that uh the reality is that
 
01:45:13.709 --> 01:45:13.719 align:start position:0%
legislation's only been around for 20
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
years for the insurance department but
 
01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that when
 
01:45:20.430 --> 01:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
we talk about this balance that you're
 
01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
talking about the question you asked how
 
01:45:24.189 --> 01:45:24.199 align:start position:0%
do you well think about the Liquor
 
01:45:26.109 --> 01:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
Commission they're enforcement and
 
01:45:28.350 --> 01:45:28.360 align:start position:0%
they're also selling okay so so they
 
01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
have that Balancing Act also which we we
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
will regulate but uh it's important for
 
01:45:35.709 --> 01:45:35.719 align:start position:0%
everyone to understand that the how
 
01:45:37.950 --> 01:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
these two uh why they're here why
 
01:45:40.109 --> 01:45:40.119 align:start position:0%
they're in our committee uh because we
 
01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
are consumer protection and we were are
 
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
o oversight and ensuring that both the
 
01:45:47.070 --> 01:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
banking and insurance departments are up
 
01:45:50.910 --> 01:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
requirements for Budget purposes to were
 
01:45:55.709 --> 01:45:55.719 align:start position:0%
under the justice and public protection
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
section so it all it all kind of makes
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
sense when you look at it like that
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
right perfect and with that will thank
 
01:46:05.629 --> 01:46:05.639 align:start position:0%
you very much and actually do we have
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
anybody in the banking Department I was
 
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
going to do this with the insurance
 
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
department but we had too many questions
 
01:46:11.229 --> 01:46:11.239 align:start position:0%
but is any any you we're all set with
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%

the mic
yeah

01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
sorry this is actually a very
 
01:46:41.229 --> 01:46:41.239 align:start position:0%
interesting Dynamic that we have here in
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and that is
 
01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
um that in terms of the different types
 
01:46:48.510 --> 01:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
of financial institutions in the State

obviously thrived and done well in the
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so they these are
 
01:47:07.470 --> 01:47:07.480 align:start position:0%

01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
ational Charter Banks um been with the
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%

um and I'll be in front of you quite a
 
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
bit this this session um supporting

legislation that we put forward over in
 
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate that has to do with uh State
 
01:48:39.910 --> 01:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
Charter Banks ability to lend um as well
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
as new chartered Banks um and I will
 
01:48:45.629 --> 01:48:45.639 align:start position:0%
boast that uh for New Hampshire we have
 
01:48:49.470 --> 01:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
a very robust um new uh it's called the
 
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
noo uh uh environment here in New
 
01:48:53.790 --> 01:48:53.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we've had had quite a few
 
01:48:58.669 --> 01:48:58.679 align:start position:0%
denovos uh uh Charter here over the past
 
01:49:01.149 --> 01:49:01.159 align:start position:0%
uh say 16 years explain what it that
 
01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
means so denovo is when a bank um starts
 
01:49:07.589 --> 01:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
up um they're put into denovo status
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
they're and it's a heighten level of
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
scrutiny with The Regulators um and so
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
it they after a certain period of time
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
they come out of denovo status um so
 
01:49:19.229 --> 01:49:19.239 align:start position:0%
actually the bill that's over in the
 
01:49:22.990 --> 01:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
Senate uh ties our denovo status to uh
 
01:49:25.470 --> 01:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
the FDIC since State Charter banks have
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
both the banking Department as well as
 
01:49:31.229 --> 01:49:31.239 align:start position:0%
the FDIC as their as their regulator um
 
01:49:32.830 --> 01:49:32.840 align:start position:0%
I do have a handout for the committee
 
01:49:35.470 --> 01:49:35.480 align:start position:0%

members sitting on thank you very much
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
um I guess the last thing I want to say
 
01:50:19.589 --> 01:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
about again these two and and really is
 
01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
that um and re Sur say get to your kind
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
of question is the fundamental issue of
 
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
consumer protection is obviously
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
restitution to to the to uh the consumer
 
01:50:36.669 --> 01:50:36.679 align:start position:0%
but in terms of what our agencies do is
 
01:50:39.629 --> 01:50:39.639 align:start position:0%
their responsibility is
 
01:50:42.189 --> 01:50:42.199 align:start position:0%
solvency okay that we want to make sure
 
01:50:44.069 --> 01:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
that and and I you know and DJ did
 
01:50:45.550 --> 01:50:45.560 align:start position:0%
mention it and the bank commissioner
 
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned is that that yes solvency is
 
01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
important and even like when that denovo
 
01:50:53.310 --> 01:50:53.320 align:start position:0%
issue um you know we someone started up
 
01:50:54.830 --> 01:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
we got to make sure that they really
 
01:50:58.350 --> 01:50:58.360 align:start position:0%
have uh the wherewithal to be in the
 
01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
business and be leny and uh so you will
 
01:51:05.550 --> 01:51:05.560 align:start position:0%
I would always say that we were in New
 
01:51:07.149 --> 01:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was the first state to to have
 
01:51:09.390 --> 01:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
an insurance department and the reason
 
01:51:10.910 --> 01:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
why the insurance department was created
 
01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
and I didn't realize until I read tip
 
01:51:15.550 --> 01:51:15.560 align:start position:0%
O'Neil's book was the that was the major
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
issue even in Washington which was
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
solvency was could an insurance company
 
01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:22.719 align:start position:0%
make a promise sell you say sell you
 
01:51:24.990 --> 01:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
product life insurance and then really
 
01:51:28.069 --> 01:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
be there when you died and whether they
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
really did Cover the the policy and
 
01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
solvency is very important so at the end
 
01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
of the day that um you will see that
 
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
consistency of consumer protection is
 
01:51:41.229 --> 01:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
not only just consumer protecting but
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
part of that consumer protecting is
 
01:51:46.109 --> 01:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the company is solvent and
 
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
and and won't
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
won't leave uh leave people high and dry
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
with that um we'll break for lunch um
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
and uh I would say that just so you all
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
know I I usually go to tandies for lunch
 
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
so it's my my my watering hle um but
 
01:52:09.790 --> 01:52:09.800 align:start position:0%
that otherwise I assume the cafeteria is
 
01:52:12.669 --> 01:52:12.679 align:start position:0%
open I don't anybody know cafeteria is
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
open and then I do know that some people
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
bring lunch
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
um and we'll be back at

Justice with me today is Jared Davis the
 
03:32:43.870 --> 03:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
assistant director um we were asked
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
twice if we were the Liquor Commission I
 
03:32:49.429 --> 03:32:49.439 align:start position:0%

Preferred Guest of the afternoon but um

03:33:00.910 --> 03:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
any of the new members on the committee
 
03:33:04.030 --> 03:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
um um we will be learning through this
 
03:33:06.189 --> 03:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
session in terms of the charitable trust
 
03:33:08.429 --> 03:33:08.439 align:start position:0%
as as well as you and we look forward to
 
03:33:10.309 --> 03:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
it I was head of the Civil Bureau a
 
03:33:12.630 --> 03:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
number of years ago and have come back
 
03:33:16.630 --> 03:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
to doj so um I have learned in a short
 
03:33:20.429 --> 03:33:20.439 align:start position:0%
time that charitable trust does a lot um
 
03:33:22.870 --> 03:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
and that a number of your constituents
 
03:33:24.870 --> 03:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
will reach out to you um about
 
03:33:28.070 --> 03:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
nonprofits that they are on or hospitals
 
03:33:30.950 --> 03:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
in their area and we are happy to speak
 
03:33:34.030 --> 03:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
to any of you and as well as them
 
03:33:37.990 --> 03:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
directly we have um three main roles um
 
03:33:42.229 --> 03:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
in the charitable trust unit one is um
 
03:33:46.590 --> 03:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
regulatory all nonprofits who conduct
 
03:33:48.630 --> 03:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
business in the state both inst State
 
03:33:50.670 --> 03:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
and out of state are required to be
 
03:33:52.910 --> 03:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
registered with the charitable trust
 
03:33:56.150 --> 03:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
unit um our unit I'll give you some of
 
03:33:58.590 --> 03:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
the history that our predecessors would
 
03:34:01.110 --> 03:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
would impart which is we were the first
 
03:34:03.750 --> 03:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
um dedicated attorney general unit for
 
03:34:06.590 --> 03:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
charitable trusts in the country and 43
 
03:34:09.189 --> 03:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
states have modeled their programs after
 
03:34:14.750 --> 03:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
ours um so we that's great some trivia
 
03:34:16.750 --> 03:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
there you go I never knew that yep but
 
03:34:19.389 --> 03:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
we have about 12,000 Charities that are
 
03:34:22.910 --> 03:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
registered with us about 7,000 are in
 
03:34:25.790 --> 03:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
state and then about 5,000 out of state
 
03:34:29.790 --> 03:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
so once a charity registers with us they
 
03:34:33.189 --> 03:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
then file annual reports with us so
 
03:34:36.870 --> 03:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
there's a fair amount of paper and um
 
03:34:38.790 --> 03:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
that we're working through on a yearly
 
03:34:40.630 --> 03:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
basis and we have a a small but
 
03:34:45.309 --> 03:34:45.319 align:start position:0%
dedicated team that does that um so when
 
03:34:47.510 --> 03:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
folks are doing that filing I think a
 
03:34:49.590 --> 03:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
very important part for us is the
 
03:34:51.950 --> 03:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
education and the handholding that we
 
03:34:55.389 --> 03:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
try to do through that process um folks
 
03:34:58.389 --> 03:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
can either file it online or in paper
 
03:35:00.990 --> 03:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
but the people who are working on or
 
03:35:03.309 --> 03:35:03.319 align:start position:0%
working on Boards of nonprofits are
 
03:35:06.269 --> 03:35:06.279 align:start position:0%
volunteers and so we try to be mindful
 
03:35:08.189 --> 03:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
of that that the work that they're doing
 
03:35:10.389 --> 03:35:10.399 align:start position:0%
is in addition to other obligations that
 
03:35:13.030 --> 03:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
they have and it can be a complicated
 
03:35:16.389 --> 03:35:16.399 align:start position:0%
process like any filings can be with an
 
03:35:19.429 --> 03:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
agency and so we spend a fair amount of
 
03:35:23.110 --> 03:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
time um our team answering calls and
 
03:35:24.990 --> 03:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
responding to emails and I'm happy to
 
03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
get this committee Jared's contact my
 
03:35:29.950 --> 03:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
direct contact but also just the general
 
03:35:32.349 --> 03:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
information about our unit and how
 
03:35:34.110 --> 03:35:34.120 align:start position:0%
citizens can get in touch with us
 
03:35:37.070 --> 03:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
because we do see one of our major roles
 
03:35:40.389 --> 03:35:40.399 align:start position:0%
is helping individuals um to be able to
 
03:35:42.309 --> 03:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
conduct the charitable work that that
 
03:35:47.189 --> 03:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
they do um the other um big component of
 
03:35:50.269 --> 03:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
the work that we do is education um we
 
03:35:53.030 --> 03:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
have a number of materials and resources
 
03:35:55.229 --> 03:35:55.239 align:start position:0%
and we speak to a number of groups
 
03:35:57.309 --> 03:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
regarding not just the obligations of
 
03:36:00.189 --> 03:36:00.199 align:start position:0%
being on a board and what that entails
 
03:36:02.590 --> 03:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
but we also um do a number of
 
03:36:03.910 --> 03:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
presentations with
 
03:36:07.710 --> 03:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities about um Library trusts
 
03:36:10.469 --> 03:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
um someone I had met is a trustee for
 
03:36:13.550 --> 03:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
their for their Town um and so we work
 
03:36:16.389 --> 03:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
with municipalities on a regular basis
 
03:36:19.110 --> 03:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
with the filings that they have to do um
 
03:36:22.070 --> 03:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
with our office the last major component
 
03:36:24.189 --> 03:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
that we do is enforcement and what that
 
03:36:27.990 --> 03:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
means is when we get a complaint that a
 
03:36:29.990 --> 03:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
charity hasn't been properly registered
 
03:36:32.510 --> 03:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
with us or something more serious in
 
03:36:35.790 --> 03:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
terms of a theft or or misdoings of a
 
03:36:38.630 --> 03:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
particular charity um we have common law
 
03:36:42.150 --> 03:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
and we have statutory authority to
 
03:36:44.590 --> 03:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
investigate that and to bring action on
 
03:36:46.189 --> 03:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
behalf of the public
 
03:36:49.630 --> 03:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
so that is a major role that that we
 
03:36:52.309 --> 03:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
have it also ties into our education one
 
03:36:54.229 --> 03:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
of the things we're working on this year
 
03:36:58.110 --> 03:36:58.120 align:start position:0%
is materials related to Good Financial
 
03:37:00.550 --> 03:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
governance for our boards so that they
 
03:37:03.189 --> 03:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
can understand the importance of the
 
03:37:04.750 --> 03:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
funds that they're holding for the
 
03:37:07.990 --> 03:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
public and how to make prevent um theft
 
03:37:09.950 --> 03:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
from occurring so those are some of the
 
03:37:13.830 --> 03:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
things we work on some of you may have
 
03:37:15.790 --> 03:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
seen a small article about about the
 
03:37:18.030 --> 03:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
sale of Catholic Medical Center
 
03:37:20.670 --> 03:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday little little thing small
 
03:37:26.269 --> 03:37:26.279 align:start position:0%
small news um our office um oversees the
 
03:37:28.550 --> 03:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
healthc care charitable trusts in New
 
03:37:30.550 --> 03:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so they include the
 
03:37:32.630 --> 03:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
nonprofit hospitals but they also
 
03:37:34.910 --> 03:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
include senior assisted living
 
03:37:38.590 --> 03:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
facilities um and other um Health Care
 
03:37:40.750 --> 03:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
um hospice centers and things of that
 
03:37:44.349 --> 03:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
nature so when there is an acquisition
 
03:37:47.830 --> 03:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
like that happen is about to happen HCA
 
03:37:51.070 --> 03:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
acquiring a nonprofit um both the
 
03:37:53.110 --> 03:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
charitable trust unit as well as
 
03:37:55.309 --> 03:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
Brandon's unit of the consumer
 
03:37:58.229 --> 03:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
protection division we have statutory
 
03:38:02.229 --> 03:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
review over those um over those proposed
 
03:38:04.950 --> 03:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
Acquisitions and and they're big they're
 
03:38:06.750 --> 03:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
complex they're timec consuming but
 
03:38:08.469 --> 03:38:08.479 align:start position:0%
they're important and what this
 
03:38:11.510 --> 03:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
legislature has given us is a clear
 
03:38:14.710 --> 03:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
mandate to make sure that the citizens
 
03:38:16.910 --> 03:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
have public information about what is
 
03:38:19.349 --> 03:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
happening a right to contact the
 
03:38:21.710 --> 03:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice um and that they
 
03:38:24.269 --> 03:38:24.279 align:start position:0%
have access to to the information to
 
03:38:26.550 --> 03:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
understand um what will be happening so
 
03:38:30.750 --> 03:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
that is a major role that that we do um
 
03:38:33.990 --> 03:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
because Healthcare entities are changing
 
03:38:37.070 --> 03:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
all the time not just hospitals but um
 
03:38:38.950 --> 03:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
because of financial situations and
 
03:38:41.309 --> 03:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
because of efficiencies different groups
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
are are constantly um changing hands and
 
03:38:47.510 --> 03:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
so we we usually have one of those
 
03:38:50.469 --> 03:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
Acquisitions that we're reviewing at any
 
03:38:51.630 --> 03:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
at any
 
03:38:55.429 --> 03:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
time another area of the work that we do
 
03:38:57.790 --> 03:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
um is Charter Schools which are
 
03:39:00.590 --> 03:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
nonprofits we work with our new um the
 
03:39:02.950 --> 03:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Education um
 
03:39:04.830 --> 03:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
and in my short time in my role I think
 
03:39:07.349 --> 03:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
we're realizing the importance I talked
 
03:39:10.229 --> 03:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
about that strong financial governance
 
03:39:12.110 --> 03:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
um and we want to make sure that these
 
03:39:15.389 --> 03:39:15.399 align:start position:0%
schools are off to a good start so we've
 
03:39:17.469 --> 03:39:17.479 align:start position:0%
built some good relationships that we
 
03:39:19.590 --> 03:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
want to build on this year with the
 
03:39:22.950 --> 03:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to make sure um
 
03:39:25.189 --> 03:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
that obviously these schools are in good
 
03:39:27.229 --> 03:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
good standing not with educa not just
 
03:39:29.910 --> 03:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
with education but with our office as
 
03:39:32.110 --> 03:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
well we want them to be successful and
 
03:39:34.590 --> 03:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a difficulty if a
 
03:39:36.750 --> 03:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
school is to go under and you know kids
 
03:39:40.030 --> 03:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
aren't graduating so that um is an area
 
03:39:43.110 --> 03:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
that that I think we are spending more
 
03:39:46.070 --> 03:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
um trying to focus on more this year and
 
03:39:48.910 --> 03:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
coordinate with our state Partners a
 
03:39:50.710 --> 03:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
number of our Charities participate in
 
03:39:53.389 --> 03:39:53.399 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming um and that is
 
03:39:55.189 --> 03:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
overseen by the Lottery Commission but
 
03:39:58.030 --> 03:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
we do work with lottery in that regard
 
03:40:00.750 --> 03:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
as well um and some of our other state
 
03:40:03.189 --> 03:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
Partners um are Health and Human
 
03:40:05.550 --> 03:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
Services obviously with respect to the
 
03:40:07.710 --> 03:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
health care but also the insurance
 
03:40:10.750 --> 03:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
department um assisted living and and
 
03:40:13.189 --> 03:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
entities of that nature are considered
 
03:40:15.309 --> 03:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
Insurance products so when there's going
 
03:40:17.550 --> 03:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
going to be a change we work with our
 
03:40:19.830 --> 03:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the insurance department
 
03:40:23.950 --> 03:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
as well um conservation easements when
 
03:40:27.309 --> 03:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
we have nothing else to do um we we
 
03:40:30.870 --> 03:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
dabble into um conservation easements
 
03:40:34.469 --> 03:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
the the courts have determined that um
 
03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
when a landowner sets aside property to
 
03:40:40.830 --> 03:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
be preserved for the environment um that
 
03:40:43.389 --> 03:40:43.399 align:start position:0%
that is a charitable trust and so our
 
03:40:47.030 --> 03:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
office will review any request to modify
 
03:40:51.870 --> 03:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
that um and we oversee that um we also
 
03:40:54.030 --> 03:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
get involved in litigation not just the
 
03:40:58.150 --> 03:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement that I spoke of but when um
 
03:41:02.229 --> 03:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
when someone um leaves um passes away
 
03:41:04.870 --> 03:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
and leaves in their will or or sets up a
 
03:41:07.670 --> 03:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
trust um money to go to a charity
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
depending on the amount of that our
 
03:41:12.510 --> 03:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
office will get involved to make sure
 
03:41:14.110 --> 03:41:14.120 align:start position:0%
that it's handled properly through the
 
03:41:16.309 --> 03:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
courts and that the money gets to its
 
03:41:20.349 --> 03:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
intended um charitable donation so we
 
03:41:22.269 --> 03:41:22.279 align:start position:0%
have a number of Court actions at any
 
03:41:25.790 --> 03:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
time and um also changes that need to
 
03:41:27.510 --> 03:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
happen because when people plan to give
 
03:41:29.710 --> 03:41:29.720 align:start position:0%
money they're doing it in the year that
 
03:41:32.349 --> 03:41:32.359 align:start position:0%
they do it and things change and laws
 
03:41:34.070 --> 03:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
change and so sometimes what they
 
03:41:36.229 --> 03:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
intended or groups they intended to give
 
03:41:39.510 --> 03:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
it to don't exist anymore and so we work
 
03:41:42.349 --> 03:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
um pretty collaboratively in terms of
 
03:41:44.429 --> 03:41:44.439 align:start position:0%
litigation it's a it's a new thing
 
03:41:47.149 --> 03:41:47.159 align:start position:0%
coming from a civil defense world where
 
03:41:48.790 --> 03:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
folks will actually reach out to us
 
03:41:50.910 --> 03:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
before they file something and they will
 
03:41:55.189 --> 03:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
want um to to get our insight and to get
 
03:41:57.990 --> 03:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know hopefully even our our positive
 
03:42:00.349 --> 03:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
feedback um before they file something
 
03:42:04.710 --> 03:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
with the court so that is a very quick
 
03:42:07.429 --> 03:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
overview of of the work that we do but I
 
03:42:09.469 --> 03:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
am more than happy to answer any
 
03:42:11.070 --> 03:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
questions and I look forward to working
 
03:42:14.189 --> 03:42:14.199 align:start position:0%
with all of you this legislative session
 
03:42:16.389 --> 03:42:16.399 align:start position:0%
great I'm so glad you came in and gave
 
03:42:18.630 --> 03:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
us the review representative melair
 
03:42:20.750 --> 03:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much um I
 
03:42:22.870 --> 03:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
thought I heard you mention that you're
 
03:42:25.550 --> 03:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
doing courses for the trustees of trust
 
03:42:28.149 --> 03:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
funds I know Terry nolles used to do
 
03:42:31.550 --> 03:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
that he's the Terry nolles of today oh
 
03:42:33.870 --> 03:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm thinking but but I I I
 
03:42:38.630 --> 03:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
heard that you had stopped them so we um
 
03:42:41.750 --> 03:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
partly true I am not the Terry knows we
 
03:42:45.189 --> 03:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
um Terry um we have had longstanding
 
03:42:47.830 --> 03:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
amazing historians such as Terry NOS who
 
03:42:49.710 --> 03:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
has worked with all of the cities and
 
03:42:52.469 --> 03:42:52.479 align:start position:0%
towns in the state we are rebuilding the
 
03:42:55.349 --> 03:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
Terry NOS knowledge base and so we are
 
03:42:58.149 --> 03:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
not doing the number of seminars but we
 
03:42:59.750 --> 03:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
have been working with
 
03:43:02.469 --> 03:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities um in terms of starting
 
03:43:04.429 --> 03:43:04.439 align:start position:0%
to go back and to give some
 
03:43:06.750 --> 03:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
presentations but I will tell you we are
 
03:43:09.590 --> 03:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
rebuilding that knowledge base well I I
 
03:43:11.830 --> 03:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
hope you would inform us when uh when
 
03:43:13.189 --> 03:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to do one of those yeah
 
03:43:16.389 --> 03:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely and I know know um
 
03:43:20.550 --> 03:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
I mentioned to to representative m m um
 
03:43:22.630 --> 03:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
that Amy Nichols is our financial
 
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
investigator who deals with works with
 
03:43:27.149 --> 03:43:27.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities but she has been doing an
 
03:43:28.990 --> 03:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
amazing job of connecting with Library
 
03:43:31.670 --> 03:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
trustees and really kind of reaching
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
doing more direct Outreach um you know
 
03:43:36.229 --> 03:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
we talked about people who are on boards
 
03:43:37.910 --> 03:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
and it's voluntary the same for the
 
03:43:40.269 --> 03:43:40.279 align:start position:0%
folks who are doing the work for their
 
03:43:43.189 --> 03:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities so AB absolutely yeah
 
03:43:44.750 --> 03:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
it'd be great you just send us the you
 
03:43:44.760 --> 03:43:45.550 align:start position:0%
it'd be great you just send us the you
know

03:43:45.550 --> 03:43:45.560 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:43:48.510 --> 03:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
email addresses and contact information
 
03:43:50.469 --> 03:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
um so when she was discussing the
 
03:43:53.510 --> 03:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
hospital merges that legislation was
 
03:43:56.389 --> 03:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
crafted in this committee room uh so
 
03:43:58.389 --> 03:43:58.399 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why she's here
 
03:44:00.429 --> 03:44:00.439 align:start position:0%
is because obviously it's issue that is
 
03:44:02.790 --> 03:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
going on um we also did The Prudent
 
03:44:05.710 --> 03:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
investor and also the bylaw changes
 
03:44:07.149 --> 03:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
about how to have the conflict of
 
03:44:09.149 --> 03:44:09.159 align:start position:0%
interests all those bills came through
 
03:44:11.429 --> 03:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
this committee yeah so that's why it's
 
03:44:15.110 --> 03:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
very much a consumer protection issue in
 
03:44:17.510 --> 03:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this committee um did I
 
03:44:19.750 --> 03:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
see a hand up representative Bros and
 
03:44:21.670 --> 03:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
then represent I have two quick
 
03:44:24.830 --> 03:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
questions um one of one of is are County
 
03:44:28.429 --> 03:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:32.229 --> 03:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
purview no per per se you know but we
 
03:44:34.830 --> 03:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
have been it depends on so they're not
 
03:44:38.389 --> 03:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
it they're not nonprofits set set up but
 
03:44:40.389 --> 03:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
I will give the example of exitor
 
03:44:42.750 --> 03:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
hospital when there was a limitation on
 
03:44:44.790 --> 03:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
services that they were going to put in
 
03:44:47.710 --> 03:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
place it was impacting um the Rockingham
 
03:44:50.750 --> 03:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
County nursing home and so you know when
 
03:44:53.990 --> 03:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
things are impacting communities like
 
03:44:56.590 --> 03:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
that we're in contact with them we're
 
03:44:58.590 --> 03:44:58.600 align:start position:0%
involved with them but they are not they
 
03:45:02.910 --> 03:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
don't file um annual reports with us so
 
03:45:04.229 --> 03:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
quick followup to that then I have
 
03:45:08.030 --> 03:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
another question so if there was if you
 
03:45:10.189 --> 03:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
if there was evidence of financial
 
03:45:12.750 --> 03:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
mismanagement just incompetence that
 
03:45:14.389 --> 03:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't you don't deal with that at all
 
03:45:16.030 --> 03:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
I think it would be at your county level
 
03:45:18.349 --> 03:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
that that reporting that that concern
 
03:45:20.550 --> 03:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
would would occur it well that that's
 
03:45:22.110 --> 03:45:22.120 align:start position:0%
going into deaf ears but that's another
 
03:45:25.550 --> 03:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
story um it would not have a little
 
03:45:27.990 --> 03:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
conflict of interests there the county I
 
03:45:30.790 --> 03:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
mean I district attorney might I have a
 
03:45:33.630 --> 03:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
followup question um if there's let's
 
03:45:35.790 --> 03:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
say that there's a local nonprofit who
 
03:45:38.389 --> 03:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
is not F following their own bylaws do
 
03:45:41.030 --> 03:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
you get involved with that we we do and
 
03:45:43.469 --> 03:45:43.479 align:start position:0%
it depends it's it depends on the level
 
03:45:45.429 --> 03:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
but that's that is a common
 
03:45:47.630 --> 03:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
complaint that we get that people
 
03:45:49.469 --> 03:45:49.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes they set up very complicated
 
03:45:51.309 --> 03:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
bylaws and then they just realize they
 
03:45:54.389 --> 03:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
aren't worth necessarily following but
 
03:45:56.510 --> 03:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
they never actually Chang them and so
 
03:45:58.910 --> 03:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
that is what we call as board governance
 
03:46:02.110 --> 03:46:02.120 align:start position:0%
and so when we get aware of situations
 
03:46:03.750 --> 03:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
where where boards are not kind of
 
03:46:05.469 --> 03:46:05.479 align:start position:0%
following their bylaws or there's
 
03:46:08.110 --> 03:46:08.120 align:start position:0%
concerns about that we do we do we start
 
03:46:10.910 --> 03:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
in an education mode um and reach out
 
03:46:13.269 --> 03:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
and see if we can um sometimes we'll sit
 
03:46:14.950 --> 03:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
in on a meeting and we'll listen but
 
03:46:16.149 --> 03:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
that is something that we would get
 
03:46:19.110 --> 03:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
involved and and just a a comment um I I
 
03:46:21.030 --> 03:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
have utmost respect for Terry nolles and
 
03:46:22.670 --> 03:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
her knowledge but she did once call me
 
03:46:24.590 --> 03:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
into her office as a as a board chair
 
03:46:27.710 --> 03:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
and made me cry but I forgive her well
 
03:46:31.309 --> 03:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
now I have a new goal not to make anyone
 
03:46:33.710 --> 03:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
cry thank
 
03:46:36.990 --> 03:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
you okay repres H thank you Mr chair
 
03:46:38.910 --> 03:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking our questions um
 
03:46:40.990 --> 03:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the hospital acquisition
 
03:46:43.030 --> 03:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
and I if I recall that's a case of a
 
03:46:45.550 --> 03:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
profit for-profit business acquiring a
 
03:46:47.950 --> 03:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
nonprofit business I was just curious
 
03:46:50.429 --> 03:46:50.439 align:start position:0%
are extra complications with that
 
03:46:52.950 --> 03:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
scenario and just briefly thank you yeah
 
03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
yeah um yes it is um you know it it's
 
03:46:59.110 --> 03:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
the same statute it's it's it's the same
 
03:47:02.070 --> 03:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
review but when a for profit takes over
 
03:47:04.790 --> 03:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
a hospital they don't come within the
 
03:47:07.269 --> 03:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
direct purview of the charitable trust
 
03:47:10.469 --> 03:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
any longer that being said the agreement
 
03:47:12.550 --> 03:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
that that from the report we issued
 
03:47:14.429 --> 03:47:14.439 align:start position:0%
yesterday is that you know there's
 
03:47:16.349 --> 03:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
conditions that exist for a 10-year
 
03:47:18.149 --> 03:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
period that they would still be subject
 
03:47:21.670 --> 03:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
to but it is it is different and and we
 
03:47:23.550 --> 03:47:23.560 align:start position:0%
have to look at the fact that they won't
 
03:47:26.189 --> 03:47:26.199 align:start position:0%
be a charitable trust anymore right but
 
03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
and more important is the assets do not
 
03:47:31.630 --> 03:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
you they can't acquire the netw wor the
 
03:47:34.630 --> 03:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
assets the trust and that uh and when
 
03:47:37.590 --> 03:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
Anthem uh changed its uh Charter they
 
03:47:40.429 --> 03:47:40.439 align:start position:0%
actually had to uh pay to the create a
 
03:47:43.189 --> 03:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
foundation yeah so so we would if there
 
03:47:46.469 --> 03:47:46.479 align:start position:0%
were a for-profit buying nonprofit the
 
03:47:49.229 --> 03:47:49.239 align:start position:0%
assets of the nonprofit that cash value
 
03:47:51.750 --> 03:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
their Book value um has to go to a
 
03:47:53.750 --> 03:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
nonprofit it has to create a charitable
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
trust it's a great it's a great point
 
03:47:58.149 --> 03:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
and it's not just a hospital acquisition
 
03:48:01.389 --> 03:48:01.399 align:start position:0%
but when a nonprofit dissolves and stops
 
03:48:04.429 --> 03:48:04.439 align:start position:0%
doing business it has to give its um any
 
03:48:07.149 --> 03:48:07.159 align:start position:0%
assets it has to another nonprofit or to
 
03:48:09.189 --> 03:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
a governmental entity so we're working
 
03:48:12.189 --> 03:48:12.199 align:start position:0%
with um entities to make sure that that
 
03:48:15.269 --> 03:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
happens but that's right um cmc's assets
 
03:48:18.349 --> 03:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
or restricted donations would not go to
 
03:48:20.469 --> 03:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
to the health
 
03:48:23.630 --> 03:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
HCA thank you very much yeah thank
 
03:48:23.640 --> 03:48:26.149 align:start position:0%

okay morning everybody uh I recognize
 
03:48:44.590 --> 03:48:44.600 align:start position:0%
many of you uh seeing a few of you for
 
03:48:46.990 --> 03:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
the first time for those who I haven't
 
03:48:48.269 --> 03:48:48.279 align:start position:0%
interacted with before my name is
 
03:48:50.510 --> 03:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
Brandon Gad I am a senior Assistant
 
03:48:52.309 --> 03:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
Attorney General and the chief of the
 
03:48:53.790 --> 03:48:53.800 align:start position:0%
consumer protection and anti trust
 
03:48:56.030 --> 03:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
Bureau at the Department of Justice um I
 
03:48:59.229 --> 03:48:59.239 align:start position:0%
have been in this role for I think seven
 
03:49:02.149 --> 03:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
years this July before that I headed the
 
03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
Department's elder abuse and financial
 
03:49:06.030 --> 03:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
exploitation unit which is part of the
 
03:49:08.229 --> 03:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
bureau prior to that I was a criminal
 
03:49:10.469 --> 03:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
prosecutor uh for various counties here
 
03:49:13.070 --> 03:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so I always like to
 
03:49:15.070 --> 03:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
take this time to you know accomplish
 
03:49:17.429 --> 03:49:17.439 align:start position:0%
two things the first is to give you all
 
03:49:19.550 --> 03:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
a super high level overview of what the
 
03:49:21.309 --> 03:49:21.319 align:start position:0%
consumer protection antitrust Bureau
 
03:49:24.510 --> 03:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
does and the second is to give you all a
 
03:49:26.950 --> 03:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
preview of the types of testimony that
 
03:49:30.070 --> 03:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
you are likely to hear from me um pretty
 
03:49:31.590 --> 03:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
much every single week for the entirety
 
03:49:33.830 --> 03:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
of this session unless I decide to send
 
03:49:35.590 --> 03:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
somebody else but the testimony should
 
03:49:38.030 --> 03:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
be the same either way so similar to
 
03:49:40.950 --> 03:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
what Maryann said um the Consumer
 
03:49:42.790 --> 03:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau like every division of
 
03:49:44.070 --> 03:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office and
 
03:49:45.670 --> 03:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
probably every vision of you know most
 
03:49:47.870 --> 03:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
state government is very very busy and
 
03:49:51.149 --> 03:49:51.159 align:start position:0%
handles way more than you would think um
 
03:49:53.590 --> 03:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
if we were to more accurately describe
 
03:49:55.269 --> 03:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
the bureau it would go from the consumer
 
03:49:56.950 --> 03:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
protection antitrust Bureau to the
 
03:49:58.429 --> 03:49:58.439 align:start position:0%
consumer protection and antitrust and
 
03:50:00.830 --> 03:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
elder abuse and tobacco and data privacy
 
03:50:03.110 --> 03:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
and condominium and Health Club
 
03:50:05.630 --> 03:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
registration and miscellaneous Bureau
 
03:50:06.990 --> 03:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
but you know that doesn't fit as neatly
 
03:50:10.269 --> 03:50:10.279 align:start position:0%
on a business card so here we are um at
 
03:50:13.870 --> 03:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
the Crux of what we do though is enforce
 
03:50:15.750 --> 03:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's consumer protection act
 
03:50:16.990 --> 03:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
which is RSA
 
03:50:19.750 --> 03:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
358a which makes it unlawful for those
 
03:50:21.670 --> 03:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
in the state who engage in trade or
 
03:50:24.590 --> 03:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
Commerce to engage in what are defined
 
03:50:27.149 --> 03:50:27.159 align:start position:0%
as unfair and deceptive Acts or
 
03:50:30.349 --> 03:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
practices and what that means is um two
 
03:50:31.830 --> 03:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
different things there are a number of
 
03:50:33.229 --> 03:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
statutes including the consumer
 
03:50:35.269 --> 03:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
protection act that have specifically
 
03:50:38.229 --> 03:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
said certain conduct is an unfair
 
03:50:39.870 --> 03:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
deceptive actor practice and is a
 
03:50:42.630 --> 03:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
violation of the statute um some like
 
03:50:44.790 --> 03:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
really simple examples of that are if
 
03:50:46.389 --> 03:50:46.399 align:start position:0%
you are selling something and you are
 
03:50:49.790 --> 03:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
making claims about the quality of what
 
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
you're selling or the materials that are
 
03:50:54.229 --> 03:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
built into what you are selling or the
 
03:50:55.830 --> 03:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
performance of what you are selling and
 
03:50:57.189 --> 03:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
you don't have any basis for making
 
03:50:59.349 --> 03:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
those claims um that's an unfair
 
03:51:01.710 --> 03:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
deceptive actor practice uh another like
 
03:51:05.510 --> 03:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
very specific New Hampshire only unfair
 
03:51:06.950 --> 03:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
and deceptive actor practice that you
 
03:51:09.349 --> 03:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
know this legislature put into an effect
 
03:51:11.349 --> 03:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
in response to events in the state um
 
03:51:14.189 --> 03:51:14.199 align:start position:0%
failure to deliver um heating fuel if
 
03:51:16.189 --> 03:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
you have a prepaid contract for heating
 
03:51:17.950 --> 03:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
fuel that's per se an unfair and
 
03:51:20.110 --> 03:51:20.120 align:start position:0%
deceptive actor practice um and there
 
03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
are a number of examples both in the
 
03:51:24.389 --> 03:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
statute and elsewhere throughout the
 
03:51:28.030 --> 03:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
rsas um where conduct that is engaged in
 
03:51:30.149 --> 03:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
in trade or Commerce is specifically
 
03:51:32.429 --> 03:51:32.439 align:start position:0%
defined as an unfair and deceptive actor
 
03:51:35.229 --> 03:51:35.239 align:start position:0%
practice um a recent example I mentioned
 
03:51:38.110 --> 03:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
data privacy beginning January 1 um
 
03:51:40.149 --> 03:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
there's a a comprehensive data privacy
 
03:51:41.269 --> 03:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
statute that was enacted by the
 
03:51:44.030 --> 03:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
legislature last year um now affords you
 
03:51:46.590 --> 03:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
know sign ific rights to New Hampshire
 
03:51:48.710 --> 03:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
citizens in terms of knowing about how
 
03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
companies are managing their data um
 
03:51:52.870 --> 03:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
using their data selling their data for
 
03:51:54.309 --> 03:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
targeted advertising and having the
 
03:51:56.510 --> 03:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
right to you know request copies of it
 
03:51:58.469 --> 03:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
request deletion to opt out of targeted
 
03:52:00.950 --> 03:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
advertising any violation of that I
 
03:52:03.429 --> 03:52:03.439 align:start position:0%
think it's about a 10 page statute is an
 
03:52:05.309 --> 03:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
unfair deceptive actor practice and a
 
03:52:06.870 --> 03:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
violation of the consumer protection act
 
03:52:09.309 --> 03:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
but it also gives us broad authority to
 
03:52:13.110 --> 03:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
look at any conduct in trade or Commerce
 
03:52:15.510 --> 03:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
that rises to a certain level and this
 
03:52:17.750 --> 03:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
is a you know a legal determination that
 
03:52:19.349 --> 03:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
we and the courts you know are are
 
03:52:20.910 --> 03:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
constantly trying to make what where
 
03:52:23.990 --> 03:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
this level is um it's called you know we
 
03:52:25.830 --> 03:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
call it the rascality test which is a
 
03:52:27.110 --> 03:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
Preposterous name because nobody knows
 
03:52:29.429 --> 03:52:29.439 align:start position:0%
what it means but the way to think about
 
03:52:32.550 --> 03:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
it is is the conduct sufficiently bad
 
03:52:33.910 --> 03:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
like is the thing that was done
 
03:52:36.790 --> 03:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
sufficiently bad that it's worse than
 
03:52:39.510 --> 03:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
you would expect to see or worse than
 
03:52:41.469 --> 03:52:41.479 align:start position:0%
you know a general dispute that would
 
03:52:43.429 --> 03:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
occur in a specific area of trade or
 
03:52:45.189 --> 03:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
Commerce and like a good example of that
 
03:52:47.349 --> 03:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
is uh a breach of contract you know you
 
03:52:50.070 --> 03:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
hire somebody to build a house for you
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
you pay them to build a house for you
 
03:52:53.550 --> 03:52:53.560 align:start position:0%
they build the house for you but it
 
03:52:56.229 --> 03:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet the specifications of the G
 
03:52:57.790 --> 03:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
the agreement that you reached with the
 
03:52:59.950 --> 03:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
contractor it's not the quality it's not
 
03:53:02.030 --> 03:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
the materials they just didn't do a good
 
03:53:04.510 --> 03:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
enough job that's a breach of contract
 
03:53:06.189 --> 03:53:06.199 align:start position:0%
that's not a violation of the consumer
 
03:53:07.750 --> 03:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
protection act that's something that
 
03:53:09.870 --> 03:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
would be pursued by an individual in a
 
03:53:11.910 --> 03:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
civil court on their own however in that
 
03:53:13.750 --> 03:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
same scenario if you pay a contractor to
 
03:53:15.389 --> 03:53:15.399 align:start position:0%
build a house for you you contractor
 
03:53:16.870 --> 03:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
never shows up and spends all the money
 
03:53:19.110 --> 03:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
on somebody else's job or spends all the
 
03:53:20.910 --> 03:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
money on themselves and you don't get
 
03:53:22.110 --> 03:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
the house and you don't get the money
 
03:53:24.189 --> 03:53:24.199 align:start position:0%
back that's an unfair deceptive actor
 
03:53:25.990 --> 03:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
practice that's bad enough that rises to
 
03:53:27.630 --> 03:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
that level of rascality where we would
 
03:53:30.229 --> 03:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
have the authority um to investigate and
 
03:53:31.830 --> 03:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
to bring an enforcement action to do a
 
03:53:34.590 --> 03:53:34.600 align:start position:0%
number of different things so we have
 
03:53:37.590 --> 03:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
both civil and criminal Authority um and
 
03:53:39.670 --> 03:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
investigative tools to a try to
 
03:53:42.030 --> 03:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
determine whether a violation exists and
 
03:53:44.229 --> 03:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
B if we determine that it has to decide
 
03:53:45.630 --> 03:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
whether whether it's more appropriate to
 
03:53:47.630 --> 03:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
sue the business um through a civil
 
03:53:49.750 --> 03:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement action or if it's bad enough
 
03:53:51.790 --> 03:53:51.800 align:start position:0%
to actually bring criminal charges to
 
03:53:53.870 --> 03:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
seek incarceration and a criminal
 
03:53:56.550 --> 03:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
conviction based on the conduct um you
 
03:53:59.670 --> 03:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
that that those types of Remedies you
 
03:54:01.950 --> 03:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
know both give us the ability to do two
 
03:54:03.590 --> 03:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
really important things one is to stop
 
03:54:05.229 --> 03:54:05.239 align:start position:0%
the conduct whether it's through a civil
 
03:54:07.710 --> 03:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
injunction or through a a criminal order
 
03:54:09.710 --> 03:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
and two is to get restitution for folks
 
03:54:12.590 --> 03:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
who are wronged by this bad conduct um
 
03:54:14.429 --> 03:54:14.439 align:start position:0%
everything we almost everything we do in
 
03:54:16.469 --> 03:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection Bureau is you know
 
03:54:19.030 --> 03:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
oriented towards stopping bad conduct
 
03:54:20.469 --> 03:54:20.479 align:start position:0%
that protects the public from future
 
03:54:22.990 --> 03:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
harm as well as getting money back
 
03:54:24.510 --> 03:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
putting people in the place that they
 
03:54:26.670 --> 03:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
would have been but for the bad conduct
 
03:54:28.189 --> 03:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
that already
 
03:54:30.590 --> 03:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
existed so that's like that's our
 
03:54:32.630 --> 03:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
consumer protection enforcement we also
 
03:54:34.950 --> 03:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know uh maryan already previewed
 
03:54:37.710 --> 03:54:37.720 align:start position:0%
this a little bit but any time there is
 
03:54:41.110 --> 03:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
a combination of two businesses in the
 
03:54:43.389 --> 03:54:43.399 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um we have the
 
03:54:45.070 --> 03:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
authority to look at it under antitrust
 
03:54:47.870 --> 03:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
statutes which um you know most
 
03:54:50.910 --> 03:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
frequently at least lately has uh been
 
03:54:52.590 --> 03:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
in the context of the healthcare
 
03:54:54.229 --> 03:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
industry two hospitals trying to come
 
03:54:57.149 --> 03:54:57.159 align:start position:0%
together so Marian's review is separate
 
03:54:58.990 --> 03:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
from the consumer protection bureau's
 
03:55:01.030 --> 03:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
review our review is focused
 
03:55:03.429 --> 03:55:03.439 align:start position:0%
specifically on whether the combination
 
03:55:07.750 --> 03:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
as it's proposed um is likely to result
 
03:55:10.189 --> 03:55:10.199 align:start position:0%
in a loss of competition that would lead
 
03:55:12.990 --> 03:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
to higher prices loss of quality loss of
 
03:55:16.469 --> 03:55:16.479 align:start position:0%
consumer choice um and so we review um
 
03:55:18.670 --> 03:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
Healthcare mergers and conceivably you
 
03:55:20.309 --> 03:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
know other mergers although it's been
 
03:55:22.349 --> 03:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
all Healthcare lately um using that
 
03:55:24.550 --> 03:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
statute and if we determine that a
 
03:55:26.389 --> 03:55:26.399 align:start position:0%
combination does rise to that level
 
03:55:28.030 --> 03:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
where it is a violation of any trust
 
03:55:30.269 --> 03:55:30.279 align:start position:0%
laws um and could result in the loss of
 
03:55:32.030 --> 03:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
competition in higher prices we have the
 
03:55:35.149 --> 03:55:35.159 align:start position:0%
ability a to bring an action to block
 
03:55:38.110 --> 03:55:38.120 align:start position:0%
that transaction which is a very very
 
03:55:40.590 --> 03:55:40.600 align:start position:0%
high burden to meet you know anytime the
 
03:55:42.070 --> 03:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
government is intervening in a private
 
03:55:43.510 --> 03:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
business deal it should be a very high
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
burden for the government to come in and
 
03:55:48.229 --> 03:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
completely undo that more often than not
 
03:55:51.149 --> 03:55:51.159 align:start position:0%
though what happens if we can is to to
 
03:55:53.229 --> 03:55:53.239 align:start position:0%
work with the parties to negotiate a
 
03:55:55.630 --> 03:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
resolution that mitigates the the harm
 
03:55:57.389 --> 03:55:57.399 align:start position:0%
that we anticipate happening if the the
 
03:55:58.990 --> 03:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
deal was Consolidated which is what you
 
03:56:01.550 --> 03:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
saw yesterday in the Catholic Medical
 
03:56:05.389 --> 03:56:05.399 align:start position:0%
Center HCA Healthcare deal um The Bureau
 
03:56:07.309 --> 03:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
also very quickly does there's an elder
 
03:56:10.070 --> 03:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
abuse and financial exploitation unit um
 
03:56:11.269 --> 03:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
that was the first role that I had when
 
03:56:12.710 --> 03:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
I came to the Attorney General's office
 
03:56:15.110 --> 03:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
that is a purely Criminal unit housed
 
03:56:16.990 --> 03:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
within the Consumer Protection Bureau
 
03:56:19.189 --> 03:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
investigates and prosecutes criminally
 
03:56:21.510 --> 03:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
the worst cases of elder abuse neglect
 
03:56:23.750 --> 03:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
and financial exploitation in the state
 
03:56:25.830 --> 03:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
also serves a really important function
 
03:56:28.269 --> 03:56:28.279 align:start position:0%
of supporting local law enforcement and
 
03:56:30.630 --> 03:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
local County attorneys offices to ensure
 
03:56:32.870 --> 03:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
that they feel empowered and supported
 
03:56:34.790 --> 03:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
in bringing those cases because we can't
 
03:56:37.590 --> 03:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
do them all um and we have done a great
 
03:56:39.309 --> 03:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
deal of work in building up our county
 
03:56:40.990 --> 03:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
attorney's offices as well as our local
 
03:56:42.309 --> 03:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to know how to
 
03:56:43.910 --> 03:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
investigate these and not be afraid to
 
03:56:46.349 --> 03:56:46.359 align:start position:0%
bring um really difficult cases that
 
03:56:48.269 --> 03:56:48.279 align:start position:0%
often involve a victim who unfortunately
 
03:56:50.710 --> 03:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
is not able to testify um or is no
 
03:56:52.790 --> 03:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
longer with us by the time we get to
 
03:56:55.790 --> 03:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
trial um so that's super super high
 
03:56:57.510 --> 03:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
level what the consumer protection and
 
03:56:59.469 --> 03:56:59.479 align:start position:0%
anti trust Bureau does out of respect
 
03:57:00.910 --> 03:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
for everybody else's time you know if
 
03:57:02.269 --> 03:57:02.279 align:start position:0%
there are any other specific questions
 
03:57:04.510 --> 03:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
about what we do I I'll take questions
 
03:57:06.469 --> 03:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
at the end but I wanted to as I said in
 
03:57:07.830 --> 03:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
the beginning to preview for you all
 
03:57:08.950 --> 03:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
like the types of things that you can
 
03:57:10.990 --> 03:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
expect to hear from me um or my
 
03:57:12.429 --> 03:57:12.439 align:start position:0%
colleagues for the duration of this
 
03:57:14.229 --> 03:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
legislative session and I think this
 
03:57:17.670 --> 03:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
really two critical things that I find
 
03:57:19.950 --> 03:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
myself constantly over here providing
 
03:57:21.870 --> 03:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
feedback to you all on when there's a a
 
03:57:24.070 --> 03:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
bill in front of you usually that is
 
03:57:26.070 --> 03:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
looking to add something on to the
 
03:57:28.149 --> 03:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act because it
 
03:57:30.550 --> 03:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
really is the easiest mechanism um if
 
03:57:32.790 --> 03:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
you want to make something unlawful and
 
03:57:35.750 --> 03:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
you want to have state enforcement of
 
03:57:37.510 --> 03:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
something and it's not something that is
 
03:57:40.110 --> 03:57:40.120 align:start position:0%
specifically regulated um by another
 
03:57:41.870 --> 03:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
state agency like the banking commission
 
03:57:43.510 --> 03:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
or the insurance department make it an
 
03:57:45.710 --> 03:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
unfair and decep actor practice as
 
03:57:47.309 --> 03:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
defined you know in the consumer
 
03:57:48.710 --> 03:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
protection act that's frequently the
 
03:57:51.590 --> 03:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
mechanism that's used and so I think
 
03:57:53.229 --> 03:57:53.239 align:start position:0%
probably the most important thing to
 
03:57:55.670 --> 03:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
consider um and that you'll hear from me
 
03:57:58.630 --> 03:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
routinely is that you know it is
 
03:58:01.910 --> 03:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
tempting and it's you know often easy to
 
03:58:03.510 --> 03:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
Simply say something is an unfair and
 
03:58:04.910 --> 03:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
deceptive act or practice and it will be
 
03:58:06.149 --> 03:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
enforced by the Attorney General's
 
03:58:07.670 --> 03:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
office but depending on what that thing
 
03:58:09.750 --> 03:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
is um a lot of the time it has the
 
03:58:12.670 --> 03:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
potential to significantly increase the
 
03:58:14.830 --> 03:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
number of cases that we have to bring
 
03:58:16.110 --> 03:58:16.120 align:start position:0%
the amount of work that we have to do
 
03:58:17.550 --> 03:58:17.560 align:start position:0%
the number of Investigations that have
 
03:58:19.790 --> 03:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
to be done and the number of litigation
 
03:58:20.990 --> 03:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
matters that the Attorney General's
 
03:58:22.950 --> 03:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
office has to bring and that often will
 
03:58:24.790 --> 03:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
necessitate additional resources in
 
03:58:27.670 --> 03:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
order to fulfill that goal um we don't
 
03:58:30.590 --> 03:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
want to see bills passed that we don't
 
03:58:33.110 --> 03:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
have the ability logistically to enforce
 
03:58:35.870 --> 03:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
on the other side so I I frequently and
 
03:58:37.469 --> 03:58:37.479 align:start position:0%
not always you know I think that there
 
03:58:39.070 --> 03:58:39.080 align:start position:0%
are amendments that can be made that you
 
03:58:42.990 --> 03:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
know we are fairly well resourced um we
 
03:58:45.670 --> 03:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
we got new resources for data privacy
 
03:58:47.149 --> 03:58:47.159 align:start position:0%
we're trying to build up a specific unit
 
03:58:50.030 --> 03:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
just for that but sometimes and
 
03:58:51.670 --> 03:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
frequently there will be you know
 
03:58:53.990 --> 03:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
something that has the potential to you
 
03:58:55.910 --> 03:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
know double the number of complaints
 
03:58:57.469 --> 03:58:57.479 align:start position:0%
that re we receive and I think it's
 
03:58:59.550 --> 03:58:59.560 align:start position:0%
important to consider those types of
 
03:59:01.630 --> 03:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
things and will frequently remind you of
 
03:59:02.790 --> 03:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
the importance of considering those
 
03:59:04.429 --> 03:59:04.439 align:start position:0%
types of things um throughout this
 
03:59:06.790 --> 03:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
legislative session the other probably
 
03:59:08.389 --> 03:59:08.399 align:start position:0%
equally as important is
 
03:59:11.990 --> 03:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
enforceability um you know I think that
 
03:59:14.670 --> 03:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
it's great to to pass a bill
 
03:59:16.189 --> 03:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
um that lays out that something is
 
03:59:18.429 --> 03:59:18.439 align:start position:0%
unlawful um but you have to make sure
 
03:59:21.110 --> 03:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
that we actually have the ability to do
 
03:59:22.349 --> 03:59:22.359 align:start position:0%
what the bill is intending that we're
 
03:59:24.269 --> 03:59:24.279 align:start position:0%
going to do and you know the the lens
 
03:59:26.189 --> 03:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
that I think is most valuable to to
 
03:59:28.269 --> 03:59:28.279 align:start position:0%
consider that from is you know if the
 
03:59:29.670 --> 03:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office on the other
 
03:59:31.550 --> 03:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
side of a bill being passed and being
 
03:59:33.670 --> 03:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
written into law receives a complaint
 
03:59:35.830 --> 03:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
from a consumer that says hey a business
 
03:59:38.110 --> 03:59:38.120 align:start position:0%
is violating this statute we want the
 
03:59:39.309 --> 03:59:39.319 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to do
 
03:59:41.790 --> 03:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
something about it does the language of
 
03:59:44.510 --> 03:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
the bill as put into law give give us
 
03:59:46.349 --> 03:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
the ability to prove that case to
 
03:59:48.110 --> 03:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
investigate that case and the problem
 
03:59:49.830 --> 03:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
that often comes up is if language is
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
too broad or there's no way to clearly
 
03:59:53.950 --> 03:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
show that somebody's doing a certain
 
03:59:56.750 --> 03:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
thing or you know that somebody has
 
03:59:58.510 --> 03:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
acted in a certain way if the language
 
04:00:00.070 --> 04:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't clearly Define that it makes it
 
04:00:02.349 --> 04:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
very difficult sometimes um if not
 
04:00:05.149 --> 04:00:05.159 align:start position:0%
impossible sometimes for us to enforce
 
04:00:06.950 --> 04:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
language the way it's drafted so I think
 
04:00:08.469 --> 04:00:08.479 align:start position:0%
you can expect to hear from me
 
04:00:10.030 --> 04:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
throughout this legislative session if
 
04:00:12.670 --> 04:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
there are issues in terms of the
 
04:00:14.309 --> 04:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
enforceability of language that's
 
04:00:16.910 --> 04:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
proposed so with that and at the risk of
 
04:00:18.309 --> 04:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
continuing to take up the rest of your
 
04:00:19.870 --> 04:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
time and delay the inevitable
 
04:00:21.950 --> 04:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
presentation by The Liquor Commission um
 
04:00:23.510 --> 04:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
04:00:26.870 --> 04:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
questions that was great representative
 
04:00:30.670 --> 04:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
spear we had a couple of bills last year
 
04:00:32.030 --> 04:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
and I suspect we're going to be having
 
04:00:36.070 --> 04:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
more of them when a business does
 
04:00:39.149 --> 04:00:39.159 align:start position:0%
something that
 
04:00:41.590 --> 04:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
definitely seems to be illegal to
 
04:00:43.189 --> 04:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
somebody I mean it's hurting the
 
04:00:46.309 --> 04:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
consumers but it's online the business
 
04:00:49.670 --> 04:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
is online do you have any reach into
 
04:00:49.680 --> 04:00:51.349 align:start position:0%
is online do you have any reach into
outof

04:00:51.349 --> 04:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
outof
 
04:00:55.110 --> 04:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
State Bad actors this is a really really
 
04:00:57.269 --> 04:00:57.279 align:start position:0%
good question and the answer is it
 
04:00:59.269 --> 04:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
depends so you know and this is
 
04:01:00.189 --> 04:01:00.199 align:start position:0%
something I probably should have
 
04:01:02.750 --> 04:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
emphasized as I was describing um the
 
04:01:05.030 --> 04:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act one of the most
 
04:01:07.149 --> 04:01:07.159 align:start position:0%
critical pieces and necessary pieces of
 
04:01:08.750 --> 04:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act and our
 
04:01:12.030 --> 04:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
Authority is that the trade or Commerce
 
04:01:14.510 --> 04:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
um happened in or affect the state of
 
04:01:16.710 --> 04:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:01:19.189 --> 04:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
so if the business is operating in the
 
04:01:20.950 --> 04:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that's easy
 
04:01:22.389 --> 04:01:22.399 align:start position:0%
they're here they're selling their
 
04:01:24.670 --> 04:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
product here they're you know servicing
 
04:01:26.349 --> 04:01:26.359 align:start position:0%
this state that's happening in the state
 
04:01:29.389 --> 04:01:29.399 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire if the business is out
 
04:01:33.469 --> 04:01:33.479 align:start position:0%
of state um and they just have a website
 
04:01:35.110 --> 04:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
and you know a New Hampshire person
 
04:01:39.590 --> 04:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
happens to access it um probably not a
 
04:01:41.950 --> 04:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
sufficient Nexus
 
04:01:44.349 --> 04:01:44.359 align:start position:0%
probably unless they
 
04:01:46.630 --> 04:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
I mean actually let me walk that back um
 
04:01:48.590 --> 04:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
if you're online and you're just putting
 
04:01:50.469 --> 04:01:50.479 align:start position:0%
something out for the whole world to see
 
04:01:52.830 --> 04:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
and somebody is you know you know Falls
 
04:01:54.750 --> 04:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
for it in a certain way we'd have to
 
04:01:57.670 --> 04:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
prove that the business anticipated that
 
04:01:59.030 --> 04:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
the thing that they're doing could
 
04:02:00.269 --> 04:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
reasonably anticipate the thing that
 
04:02:01.790 --> 04:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
they're doing would impact potentially
 
04:02:03.030 --> 04:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
trade or Commerce in the state of New
 
04:02:05.429 --> 04:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and a great example of this is
 
04:02:06.790 --> 04:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
um the Attorney General's office has
 
04:02:09.910 --> 04:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
brought two cases again one against meta
 
04:02:12.790 --> 04:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
and one against Tik Tock um for
 
04:02:14.670 --> 04:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
intentionally designing their platforms
 
04:02:16.269 --> 04:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
in a way that they knew was addictive to
 
04:02:18.790 --> 04:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
young people and harmful to young people
 
04:02:21.630 --> 04:02:21.640 align:start position:0%
and we argued a motion to dismiss on the
 
04:02:23.110 --> 04:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
medic case and one of the issues that
 
04:02:26.349 --> 04:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
was raised was meta in California um it
 
04:02:27.790 --> 04:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
can't be brought into New Hampshire
 
04:02:29.870 --> 04:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
because you know it's it can be accessed
 
04:02:31.229 --> 04:02:31.239 align:start position:0%
anywhere so there's no specific New
 
04:02:33.710 --> 04:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Nexus we argued that because
 
04:02:36.349 --> 04:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
meta enters into a contractual agreement
 
04:02:37.910 --> 04:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
with each and every one of its users
 
04:02:39.870 --> 04:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
regardless of where they are that each
 
04:02:41.670 --> 04:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
time a New Hampshire person goes and
 
04:02:44.510 --> 04:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
wants to open a meta account um and
 
04:02:46.149 --> 04:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
agrees to their terms of services and
 
04:02:47.910 --> 04:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
says yes I accept and then meta is
 
04:02:50.469 --> 04:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
providing services to that consumer that
 
04:02:52.830 --> 04:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
that was a sufficient Nexus for trade or
 
04:02:54.030 --> 04:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
Commerce in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:02:55.389 --> 04:02:55.399 align:start position:0%
and at least at the motion to dismiss
 
04:02:57.189 --> 04:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
level the judge here in Marat County
 
04:02:58.950 --> 04:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
agreed with us on that point so our case
 
04:03:00.910 --> 04:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
is continuing so that's that's the sort
 
04:03:02.710 --> 04:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
of calculus we have to do there's no
 
04:03:05.349 --> 04:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
clear cut line but if an outof State
 
04:03:07.309 --> 04:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
business is doing something that they
 
04:03:09.269 --> 04:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
either know or reasonably should know is
 
04:03:11.030 --> 04:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
going to impact trade or Commerce in the
 
04:03:13.070 --> 04:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we have an
 
04:03:13.080 --> 04:03:14.630 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we have an
argument

04:03:14.630 --> 04:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
argument
 
04:03:16.030 --> 04:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be talking to you because I
 
04:03:16.040 --> 04:03:17.910 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be talking to you because I
got

04:03:17.910 --> 04:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
got
 
04:03:22.429 --> 04:03:22.439 align:start position:0%
one okay oh we do have one more question
 
04:03:25.149 --> 04:03:25.159 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so this question from is from
 
04:03:27.429 --> 04:03:27.439 align:start position:0%
my own better understanding is it fair
 
04:03:30.229 --> 04:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
to assume that uh your Bureau acts only
 
04:03:33.469 --> 04:03:33.479 align:start position:0%
when some consumer or somebody uh brings
 
04:03:35.870 --> 04:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
a complaint or files a complaint or is
 
04:03:39.550 --> 04:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
it that uh you have resources to uh
 
04:03:42.309 --> 04:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
actively or proactively monitor if wrong
 
04:03:44.429 --> 04:03:44.439 align:start position:0%
practices are going on how how how does
 
04:03:46.990 --> 04:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
the bureau act another really great
 
04:03:49.990 --> 04:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
question um so to understand to answer
 
04:03:52.870 --> 04:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
the question is we do both um complaints
 
04:03:55.510 --> 04:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
so we have a Consumer complaint process
 
04:03:56.550 --> 04:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
um which I probably should have
 
04:03:58.950 --> 04:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
described you so we we have a volunteer
 
04:04:01.189 --> 04:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
hotline um that is five days a week
 
04:04:03.309 --> 04:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
anybody can call into the AG's office if
 
04:04:04.710 --> 04:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
they you know think they have a consumer
 
04:04:06.149 --> 04:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
issue or another issue they can talk to
 
04:04:07.990 --> 04:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
a real person and if they have a
 
04:04:09.349 --> 04:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
consumer related issue they'll be
 
04:04:11.790 --> 04:04:11.800 align:start position:0%
encouraged to file a complaint um and we
 
04:04:14.229 --> 04:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
have a complaint review process process
 
04:04:16.030 --> 04:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
where if a consumer files a complaint
 
04:04:18.550 --> 04:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
that is reasonably if you assume it's
 
04:04:20.469 --> 04:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
true a violation of the consumer
 
04:04:22.790 --> 04:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
protection act um we'll send it to the
 
04:04:24.870 --> 04:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
business on AG letterhead and say please
 
04:04:26.309 --> 04:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
provide a written response within 10
 
04:04:29.790 --> 04:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
days or 14 days um that process resolves
 
04:04:31.550 --> 04:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of low-level complaints and
 
04:04:33.870 --> 04:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
recovers a lot of money for people um
 
04:04:36.229 --> 04:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
which is a a huge tool that we use to
 
04:04:37.830 --> 04:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
help consumers in the state but the
 
04:04:39.870 --> 04:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
other thing that that process does is it
 
04:04:42.510 --> 04:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
gives me and the bureau a great
 
04:04:44.309 --> 04:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
continuous source of information
 
04:04:46.269 --> 04:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
on who the Bad actors are in the state
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
because you know if you have one
 
04:04:49.830 --> 04:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
complaint alleging bad conduct you maybe
 
04:04:52.349 --> 04:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
it's true maybe it's not you have 10
 
04:04:53.830 --> 04:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
okay this is somebody that clearly needs
 
04:04:55.910 --> 04:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
to be looked at and will alloc allocate
 
04:04:58.950 --> 04:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
resources to investigate that that's one
 
04:05:02.870 --> 04:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism that we use to investigate
 
04:05:05.910 --> 04:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
consumer protection issues in the state
 
04:05:08.910 --> 04:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
um it's not exclusive we don't require
 
04:05:11.309 --> 04:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
complaints um often times like law
 
04:05:13.349 --> 04:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement will come to us and say hey
 
04:05:14.830 --> 04:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
you should look at this business you
 
04:05:16.269 --> 04:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
know we we think there's something going
 
04:05:18.990 --> 04:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
on there um sometimes it comes from the
 
04:05:20.429 --> 04:05:20.439 align:start position:0%
legislature sometimes it comes from
 
04:05:22.510 --> 04:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
other state agencies but you know to
 
04:05:23.590 --> 04:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
answer your question it can come from
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere you know we do not necessitate
 
04:05:27.429 --> 04:05:27.439 align:start position:0%
that people file a Consumer complaint in
 
04:05:28.870 --> 04:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
order for something to be potentially
 
04:05:31.870 --> 04:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
investigated by us um but it is a really
 
04:05:33.550 --> 04:05:33.560 align:start position:0%
really powerful source of information
 
04:05:36.670 --> 04:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
that we use to um determine our own
 
04:05:38.189 --> 04:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
investigative priorities yeah that's
 
04:05:39.910 --> 04:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
really great because sometimes people
 
04:05:42.510 --> 04:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
might not feel you know educated enough
 
04:05:44.710 --> 04:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
or sometimes not comfortable enough to
 
04:05:47.149 --> 04:05:47.159 align:start position:0%
go ahead and file it to that level of
 
04:05:51.389 --> 04:05:51.399 align:start position:0%
confidence so the issue gets subsided so
 
04:05:53.070 --> 04:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to know that you have other
 
04:05:55.750 --> 04:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
means to figure that out so consumers
 
04:05:58.349 --> 04:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
can file uh when they file a complaint
 
04:06:00.269 --> 04:06:00.279 align:start position:0%
we have a a box that's intentionally
 
04:06:02.550 --> 04:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
there um that asks for their authority
 
04:06:03.790 --> 04:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
to share that complaint with the
 
04:06:05.870 --> 04:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
business and the reason we do that is
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
because um RSA
 
04:06:11.309 --> 04:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
21m something or other specifically says
 
04:06:12.550 --> 04:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
that consumer complaints are
 
04:06:14.469 --> 04:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
confidential so consumers have to give
 
04:06:15.750 --> 04:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
us permission to share it with the
 
04:06:17.269 --> 04:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
business so if a consumer checks that
 
04:06:18.990 --> 04:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
box and says I don't want you to tell
 
04:06:20.950 --> 04:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
the business we may not be able to
 
04:06:22.870 --> 04:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
engage in that information sharing
 
04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
process with the business to seek a
 
04:06:26.550 --> 04:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
resolution but we still review that
 
04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
complaint and we use that information to
 
04:06:32.710 --> 04:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
fuel our sort of sense of the pulse of
 
04:06:34.030 --> 04:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
you know who the Bad actors are in the
 
04:06:35.309 --> 04:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
state and who needs to be looked at
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
closer so they can file a complaint they
 
04:06:39.990 --> 04:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
can file a complaint anonymously they
 
04:06:42.510 --> 04:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
can file a complaint and not allow the
 
04:06:44.550 --> 04:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
business to to see the complaint they
 
04:06:46.269 --> 04:06:46.279 align:start position:0%
could also just come and ask to speak to
 
04:06:48.309 --> 04:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
an investigator in order to report you
 
04:06:49.750 --> 04:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
know Consumer Fraud that they think is
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
happening we have a number of
 
04:06:53.269 --> 04:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
investigators in the office three in the
 
04:06:55.030 --> 04:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
bureau um that are happy to meet with
 
04:06:56.830 --> 04:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
folks who don't want to formally put a
 
04:06:59.750 --> 04:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
complaint in writing um but would rather
 
04:07:01.710 --> 04:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
it's more akin to making a a report to
 
04:07:03.349 --> 04:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
law enforcement that then may or may not
 
04:07:04.750 --> 04:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
be followed up on so there there are a
 
04:07:06.870 --> 04:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
number of avenues um but if you ever
 
04:07:08.910 --> 04:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
have constituents that are concerned
 
04:07:10.510 --> 04:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
about filing a complaint I strongly
 
04:07:12.990 --> 04:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
encourage you to encourage them to do so
 
04:07:14.469 --> 04:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
and note that there are a number of ways
 
04:07:16.309 --> 04:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
that they could either do it anonymously
 
04:07:18.189 --> 04:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
or prevent us from sharing it if they
 
04:07:20.030 --> 04:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
have any concern about retaliation or
 
04:07:21.990 --> 04:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
anything like that getting complaints
 
04:07:24.149 --> 04:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
filed with us is really really important
 
04:07:25.710 --> 04:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
and really puts us in the best position
 
04:07:27.990 --> 04:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
to do our job so I hope that you share
 
04:07:29.510 --> 04:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
that with your constituents if you have
 
04:07:32.269 --> 04:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
the opportunity right but I'm saying
 
04:07:34.750 --> 04:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
having said that one of the things that
 
04:07:36.550 --> 04:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
that you probably have fairly good
 
04:07:39.269 --> 04:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
success with is when they say yes you
 
04:07:41.710 --> 04:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
can share it with the business you call
 
04:07:44.269 --> 04:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
them up and The Business just realized
 
04:07:45.510 --> 04:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
they just got a call from the Attorney
 
04:07:47.590 --> 04:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
General's office uh they're more upt to
 
04:07:49.149 --> 04:07:49.159 align:start position:0%
just say fine I'll give them their money
 
04:07:52.790 --> 04:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
back and rather it's it's staggering
 
04:07:54.670 --> 04:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
especially with big businesses so you
 
04:07:58.389 --> 04:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
know you have yes you can be secr about
 
04:08:00.830 --> 04:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
and have privacy but you're better off
 
04:08:02.870 --> 04:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
having just having the AG just call them
 
04:08:04.030 --> 04:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:08:06.590 --> 04:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
they'll they can get the resolve problem
 
04:08:08.349 --> 04:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
resolved quickly especially with bigger
 
04:08:10.510 --> 04:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
businesses where people have difficulty
 
04:08:11.910 --> 04:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
getting somebody to talk to them and
 
04:08:14.149 --> 04:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
really take their concern seriously
 
04:08:15.830 --> 04:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
um it's amazing what a letter from the
 
04:08:17.870 --> 04:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
AG's office will do in order to quickly
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
resolve a really basic issue that should
 
04:08:21.830 --> 04:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
have been resolved months ago in a
 
04:08:24.510 --> 04:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
10-minute phone call um it's frustrating
 
04:08:26.429 --> 04:08:26.439 align:start position:0%
and concerning that we have to play that
 
04:08:28.429 --> 04:08:28.439 align:start position:0%
role but we're happy to play it but it
 
04:08:31.429 --> 04:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
works representa am thank you Mr chair
 
04:08:33.030 --> 04:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking our questions um
 
04:08:34.750 --> 04:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the new expectation of
 
04:08:39.269 --> 04:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
privacy act um and I think in 2018 we
 
04:08:41.389 --> 04:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
passed that Constitutional Amendment
 
04:08:42.870 --> 04:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
right to privacy is now part of the Bill
 
04:08:46.149 --> 04:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
of Rights uh do those two things uh go
 
04:08:49.109 --> 04:08:49.119 align:start position:0%
together uh is you know is is that an
 
04:08:52.349 --> 04:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement statute for any part of that
 
04:08:54.269 --> 04:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment and if you have
 
04:08:56.830 --> 04:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
any suggestions for us to explain to our
 
04:08:59.910 --> 04:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
constituents how they could use that new
 
04:09:01.910 --> 04:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh expectation of privacy to their to
 
04:09:01.920 --> 04:09:03.790 align:start position:0%
uh expectation of privacy to their to
their

04:09:03.790 --> 04:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:09:05.670 --> 04:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
benefit I don't know that they're
 
04:09:08.710 --> 04:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
connected other than that they both have
 
04:09:12.309 --> 04:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
a similar intention which is to provide
 
04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
a greater of privacy rights to the
 
04:09:18.349 --> 04:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state um the data
 
04:09:21.630 --> 04:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
privacy statute um is very very
 
04:09:24.269 --> 04:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
specifically focused on focused on
 
04:09:27.710 --> 04:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
businesses that collect and analyze and
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
sell your personal information based on
 
04:09:32.229 --> 04:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
your activities so you log on to a
 
04:09:34.309 --> 04:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
website you look at a certain thing for
 
04:09:36.590 --> 04:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of time they record
 
04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
that this person looked at this thing
 
04:09:39.830 --> 04:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
for this much time then they keep that
 
04:09:41.469 --> 04:09:41.479 align:start position:0%
information and the next time you come
 
04:09:42.790 --> 04:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
you look at something else and they keep
 
04:09:44.189 --> 04:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
that information and what they're doing
 
04:09:45.990 --> 04:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
is slowly building a profile of you so
 
04:09:47.229 --> 04:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
that they can sell you targeted
 
04:09:49.189 --> 04:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
advertising hey this person's looked at
 
04:09:50.550 --> 04:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of fishing stuff they must be
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
interested in fishing stuff we should
 
04:09:53.710 --> 04:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
sell them ads we should sell ads to the
 
04:09:56.070 --> 04:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
fishing companies directly to this guy I
 
04:09:57.990 --> 04:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if you like fishing but you
 
04:10:01.830 --> 04:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
know that's the idea um the data privacy
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
statute deals with that scenario it
 
04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
gives consumers the right to know what
 
04:10:08.550 --> 04:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
businesses are keeping on them to opt
 
04:10:10.510 --> 04:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
out of businesses keeping information
 
04:10:12.670 --> 04:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of targeted advertising
 
04:10:15.229 --> 04:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
to in insist that businesses provide
 
04:10:16.710 --> 04:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
them with a copy of all the data that
 
04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
they've kept on them and also to delete
 
04:10:20.750 --> 04:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
their personal data at their request and
 
04:10:22.070 --> 04:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
provide confirmation that that has
 
04:10:23.550 --> 04:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
happened so it's a very specifically
 
04:10:27.670 --> 04:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
focused statute and the AG is working on
 
04:10:29.670 --> 04:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
releasing um some information that's
 
04:10:31.710 --> 04:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
going to better help consumers
 
04:10:33.510 --> 04:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
understand a that those rights exist and
 
04:10:35.429 --> 04:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
how they can exercise them I I'm hoping
 
04:10:36.910 --> 04:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
that that'll be done in the next month
 
04:10:40.830 --> 04:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
or so further question just a followup
 
04:10:43.590 --> 04:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
um so I guess the the godess you'll put
 
04:10:45.790 --> 04:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
out we'll explain some of this maybe but
 
04:10:47.469 --> 04:10:47.479 align:start position:0%
how do we know what companies are
 
04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
keeping our information are you going to
 
04:10:51.790 --> 04:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
keep like a Clearing House of companies
 
04:10:54.429 --> 04:10:54.439 align:start position:0%
or how do we know even who to
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
request a great question so part of the
 
04:11:00.269 --> 04:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
bill requires a requires that the
 
04:11:02.510 --> 04:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
business create a mechanism for
 
04:11:04.309 --> 04:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
consumers to exercise each of these
 
04:11:06.630 --> 04:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
rights but also to have a readily
 
04:11:09.710 --> 04:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
available privacy policy that lays out a
 
04:11:11.670 --> 04:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
very clear process for consumers to
 
04:11:13.309 --> 04:11:13.319 align:start position:0%
exercise each one of these rights so
 
04:11:15.109 --> 04:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
part of what we are going to do as we
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
build this unit and get it off the
 
04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
ground is to start looking at for any
 
04:11:21.229 --> 04:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
major business because California has
 
04:11:23.189 --> 04:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
had a law like this for a long time so
 
04:11:25.670 --> 04:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
has Colorado Connecticut has one so all
 
04:11:27.269 --> 04:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
the like really large companies that
 
04:11:29.109 --> 04:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
deal with the whole country are already
 
04:11:30.670 --> 04:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
complying with laws that are similar to
 
04:11:32.070 --> 04:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
this so they've already they have
 
04:11:33.870 --> 04:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
privacy policies they should be readily
 
04:11:36.309 --> 04:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
available and they should describe to
 
04:11:38.269 --> 04:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
your con average consumer here's how you
 
04:11:40.830 --> 04:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
can do A B C or D um we're going to
 
04:11:42.950 --> 04:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
start you know going through businesses
 
04:11:44.990 --> 04:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure Bas essentially like cold
 
04:11:47.349 --> 04:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
calling um looking at privacy policies
 
04:11:49.030 --> 04:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
to see and make sure that they comply
 
04:11:50.790 --> 04:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire specific statutes but
 
04:11:52.630 --> 04:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
that's how it's all based on their
 
04:11:54.510 --> 04:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
required to disclose to you in their
 
04:11:56.510 --> 04:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
privacy policy here's how you can
 
04:11:58.030 --> 04:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
exercise each of these consumer rights
 
04:12:00.349 --> 04:12:00.359 align:start position:0%
and if they don't do that um that would
 
04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
be an unfair and deceptive actor
 
04:12:02.910 --> 04:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
practice and give us all those rights
 
04:12:04.469 --> 04:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
and remedies we talked about earlier
 
04:12:06.790 --> 04:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
then they'll get the letter well you
 
04:12:08.030 --> 04:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
might get more than a
 
04:12:11.710 --> 04:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
letter just one more brief question so
 
04:12:14.229 --> 04:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
we have a private company collects our
 
04:12:16.710 --> 04:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
property tax data uh in my town it's
 
04:12:19.189 --> 04:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
Avatar uh they're not a they're not a
 
04:12:20.710 --> 04:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
government agency but they work for the
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
government does that expectation of
 
04:12:25.590 --> 04:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
privacy act apply to a to that scenario
 
04:12:28.269 --> 04:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
where it's a a company providing
 
04:12:30.189 --> 04:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
collecting data on behalf of the
 
04:12:34.109 --> 04:12:34.119 align:start position:0%
government so a there are a number of
 
04:12:36.870 --> 04:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
exemptions and it is quite an extensive
 
04:12:38.910 --> 04:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
list of exemptions that reference a
 
04:12:42.790 --> 04:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
number of federal privacy statutes um so
 
04:12:46.630 --> 04:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
I it I don't know it would cover as a
 
04:12:49.349 --> 04:12:49.359 align:start position:0%
general premise it would cover um
 
04:12:51.149 --> 04:12:51.159 align:start position:0%
somebody Who's acting on behalf of
 
04:12:53.030 --> 04:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
another business for the purpose of
 
04:12:57.550 --> 04:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
collecting um data um it defines the two
 
04:12:59.710 --> 04:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
categories as controllers and processors
 
04:13:02.269 --> 04:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
you know controllers are the companies
 
04:13:03.790 --> 04:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
that are deciding what to do with the
 
04:13:05.630 --> 04:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
data the processors are the folks that
 
04:13:07.510 --> 04:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
are collecting and basically providing
 
04:13:09.389 --> 04:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
the the data to the controller in order
 
04:13:10.510 --> 04:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
for them to do whatever they want to do
 
04:13:12.630 --> 04:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
with it so as a as a general principle I
 
04:13:13.750 --> 04:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
would say yes
 
04:13:15.070 --> 04:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
but as you talk about like somebody
 
04:13:16.910 --> 04:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
who's working for a government agency
 
04:13:20.630 --> 04:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
I'm just be mindful that I'm not 100%
 
04:13:22.189 --> 04:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
familiar with all the exemptions how
 
04:13:24.550 --> 04:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
they apply yet so there are a number of
 
04:13:27.670 --> 04:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:31.309 --> 04:13:31.319 align:start position:0%
apply thank you very much thank you all
 
04:13:41.109 --> 04:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:48.790 --> 04:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:52.670 --> 04:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so when I was first
 
04:13:55.630 --> 04:13:55.640 align:start position:0%
elected Securities used to be a
 
04:13:55.640 --> 04:13:57.670 align:start position:0%
elected Securities used to be a
standalone

04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
standalone
 
04:14:00.389 --> 04:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
entity and and then it was I think it
 
04:14:02.790 --> 04:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
was Wayne King Senator King's brilliant
 
04:14:05.630 --> 04:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
idea that uh we didn't need a separate
 
04:14:08.229 --> 04:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
eny we'll just bring it
 
04:14:12.149 --> 04:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
into the Secretary of State's office and
 
04:14:14.469 --> 04:14:14.479 align:start position:0%
that's why you have the deputy
 
04:14:20.070 --> 04:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:30.590 --> 04:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:52.750 --> 04:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:55.189 --> 04:14:55.199 align:start position:0%

on the the fact sheet that I just uh
 
04:15:37.429 --> 04:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
provided to you uh you'll note that uh
 
04:15:39.269 --> 04:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
at the very outset we mentioned what the
 
04:15:41.149 --> 04:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
charges of the Bureau of Securities and
 
04:15:43.030 --> 04:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
that is number one to protect new
 
04:15:45.469 --> 04:15:45.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire investors uh second is to
 
04:15:47.670 --> 04:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
enforce the Securities laws of the State
 
04:15:50.550 --> 04:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh ensure there's
 
04:15:52.870 --> 04:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
proper and fair Capital formation here
 
04:15:55.309 --> 04:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
in the state and really most importantly
 
04:15:57.630 --> 04:15:57.640 align:start position:0%
to protect New Hampshire investors and
 
04:16:00.870 --> 04:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
provide investor education and we really
 
04:16:04.510 --> 04:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
do this by way a variety of ways first
 
04:16:06.469 --> 04:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
is uh through licensing you know making
 
04:16:08.550 --> 04:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
sure that the individuals that conduct
 
04:16:10.950 --> 04:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
Securities business in New Hampshire are
 
04:16:14.990 --> 04:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
doing so on on on a fair uh basis we
 
04:16:18.389 --> 04:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
conduct examinations of Branch offices
 
04:16:20.990 --> 04:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
of these entities that conduct business
 
04:16:24.389 --> 04:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh enforcement of uh
 
04:16:26.550 --> 04:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Securities act uh
 
04:16:27.990 --> 04:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
making sure that they actually you know
 
04:16:30.149 --> 04:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
do in fact follow the law and then of
 
04:16:32.790 --> 04:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
course as I mentioned investor education
 
04:16:34.269 --> 04:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
so this afternoon what I would like to
 
04:16:36.429 --> 04:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
do and I promise we will stay within our
 
04:16:39.429 --> 04:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
lotted time Mr chair is that uh we'd
 
04:16:41.109 --> 04:16:41.119 align:start position:0%
like to provide a brief overview of each
 
04:16:43.950 --> 04:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
of these uh uh four areas is uh and the
 
04:16:46.229 --> 04:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
various components I'll discuss the
 
04:16:48.590 --> 04:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
licensing audit investor education
 
04:16:51.389 --> 04:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
component uh Eric will discuss uh
 
04:16:54.109 --> 04:16:54.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement the enforcement component as
 
04:16:55.870 --> 04:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
well as uh risk Pool Management which is
 
04:16:58.590 --> 04:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
also another uh function and uh
 
04:17:01.309 --> 04:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
secretary uh Hennessy may have some uh
 
04:17:04.469 --> 04:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
paring remarks no all right well we'll
 
04:17:07.670 --> 04:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
see uh so at first start I'd like like
 
04:17:09.469 --> 04:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
to point out that the numbers that you
 
04:17:11.870 --> 04:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
have in front of you here uh really can
 
04:17:16.229 --> 04:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
be bit um um uh interesting I think to
 
04:17:17.950 --> 04:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
say the least particularly as you look
 
04:17:20.910 --> 04:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
at the sheer number of broker dealer
 
04:17:22.830 --> 04:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh the number of firms
 
04:17:25.309 --> 04:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire you'll note that
 
04:17:27.870 --> 04:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh just on the broker dealer side alone
 
04:17:29.950 --> 04:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh we have well over
 
04:17:32.590 --> 04:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
161,000 uh registered Representatives
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
licensed to conduct Securities business
 
04:17:36.109 --> 04:17:36.119 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire now certainly they're
 
04:17:38.910 --> 04:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
not all here in New Hampshire um I'd say
 
04:17:41.550 --> 04:17:41.560 align:start position:0%
maybe 2500 of that but they that
 
04:17:43.790 --> 04:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
population is licensed to solicit
 
04:17:45.750 --> 04:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
Securities business into the state of
 
04:17:48.910 --> 04:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so our our our our job uh
 
04:17:51.189 --> 04:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of oversight is can be really
 
04:17:53.710 --> 04:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
significant and why why New Hampshire
 
04:17:56.030 --> 04:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
why such a large numbers of firms and
 
04:17:58.590 --> 04:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
Reps well simply because New Hampshire
 
04:18:00.510 --> 04:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
is a wealth Center there's a lot of
 
04:18:01.830 --> 04:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
money in the in the state of New
 
04:18:04.550 --> 04:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have an older population uh
 
04:18:06.149 --> 04:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
our median age I think we're the second
 
04:18:08.510 --> 04:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
oldest in in the country next to Maine I
 
04:18:11.550 --> 04:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
think Maine being the oldest uh and when
 
04:18:13.309 --> 04:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
you have an older population you have a
 
04:18:15.710 --> 04:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
higher number of of retirees all of
 
04:18:17.389 --> 04:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
which have accumulated a lifetime of
 
04:18:20.630 --> 04:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
assets and uh fortunately it's for New
 
04:18:22.349 --> 04:18:22.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's that's terrific
 
04:18:24.990 --> 04:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in some respect uh those
 
04:18:27.269 --> 04:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
who like to conduct investment scams on
 
04:18:29.429 --> 04:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
on people go where the money is and New
 
04:18:31.990 --> 04:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is can be is and can be a
 
04:18:35.229 --> 04:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
Target uh and something that we as a
 
04:18:38.590 --> 04:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
bureau really take uh very seriously so
 
04:18:41.030 --> 04:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
just to generally describe the uh the
 
04:18:42.790 --> 04:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
areas that we regulate I could really
 
04:18:44.469 --> 04:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
kind of break it down into into two
 
04:18:46.469 --> 04:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
basic categories first being broker
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
dealers and the second is investment
 
04:18:51.830 --> 04:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
advisors and there often times um the
 
04:18:53.590 --> 04:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
titles are conflated and there are a
 
04:18:55.550 --> 04:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
number of titles out there that you I
 
04:18:56.830 --> 04:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
know for a fact that you have
 
04:18:59.269 --> 04:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
encountered uh financial representative
 
04:19:01.710 --> 04:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
Financial professionals various titles
 
04:19:03.349 --> 04:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
but it comes down to in the world of
 
04:19:06.149 --> 04:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
Securities regulation broker dealers are
 
04:19:08.389 --> 04:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
broker dealers or investment advisors
 
04:19:11.750 --> 04:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
broker dealers are are firms that buy or
 
04:19:14.590 --> 04:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
sell Securities on on your behalf uh for
 
04:19:17.550 --> 04:19:17.560 align:start position:0%
a fee for a commission and their Duty
 
04:19:19.229 --> 04:19:19.239 align:start position:0%
essentially is to make sure that
 
04:19:21.429 --> 04:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that they are proposing
 
04:19:24.109 --> 04:19:24.119 align:start position:0%
to you to purchase or sell uh is
 
04:19:27.030 --> 04:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
suitable and that it com that it fits
 
04:19:29.269 --> 04:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
within the mo your model your specific
 
04:19:32.990 --> 04:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
criteria as far as risk tolerance um and
 
04:19:35.349 --> 04:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
your investment objective and so long as
 
04:19:37.469 --> 04:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
that they do that they're carrying out
 
04:19:38.910 --> 04:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
their their Duty
 
04:19:41.510 --> 04:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
responsibly uh and and I have to say
 
04:19:43.670 --> 04:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
just you know parenthetically that in
 
04:19:45.910 --> 04:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
terms of the the all the representatives
 
04:19:47.950 --> 04:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
and firms that we represent they really
 
04:19:50.670 --> 04:19:50.680 align:start position:0%
do a terrific job um and there's just
 
04:19:53.630 --> 04:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
that small uh percentage uh that you
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
know go outside the lines that that we
 
04:19:57.990 --> 04:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
have to deal with but I I'm very secure
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
in knowing that the Securities industry
 
04:20:02.670 --> 04:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire is well regulated
 
04:20:04.550 --> 04:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh and that we have an incredible
 
04:20:06.670 --> 04:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
population of rep Representatives
 
04:20:09.670 --> 04:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
serving New Hampshire citizens the other
 
04:20:11.950 --> 04:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
uh segment is investment advisors and
 
04:20:13.429 --> 04:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
how they differ
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh is that as the the title uh infers
 
04:20:21.149 --> 04:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
they provide investment advice uh to uh
 
04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
clients uh and will operate on a either
 
04:20:27.910 --> 04:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
a set fee or may charge a small
 
04:20:30.189 --> 04:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
percentage on the overall assets of the
 
04:20:30.199 --> 04:20:31.269 align:start position:0%
percentage on the overall assets of the
client's

04:20:31.269 --> 04:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
client's
 
04:20:34.990 --> 04:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
portfolio uh and their their duty is is
 
04:20:36.349 --> 04:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
is a bit different first off the
 
04:20:38.030 --> 04:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
services that they provide are a little
 
04:20:40.670 --> 04:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
more expansive in that they will provide
 
04:20:42.630 --> 04:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
in most cases overall financial plan
 
04:20:44.990 --> 04:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
planning services not only just looking
 
04:20:46.950 --> 04:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
at the Securities but looking at their
 
04:20:50.550 --> 04:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
overall assets maybe real estate tax
 
04:20:53.469 --> 04:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
considerations uh estate planning uh
 
04:20:54.870 --> 04:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
within the confines that they're allowed
 
04:20:57.510 --> 04:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
to do so so they provide a much uh
 
04:20:59.630 --> 04:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
broader picture uh to the client and
 
04:21:03.349 --> 04:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
make recommendations and uh and they are
 
04:21:03.359 --> 04:21:04.790 align:start position:0%
make recommendations and uh and they are
considered

04:21:04.790 --> 04:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
considered
 
04:21:07.469 --> 04:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries and when I say fiduciaries I
 
04:21:09.670 --> 04:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
mean that they have to conduct business
 
04:21:12.030 --> 04:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
and represent the client based upon what
 
04:21:15.149 --> 04:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
is in the best interest of the client
 
04:21:16.710 --> 04:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
and and that's really quite a a
 
04:21:19.149 --> 04:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
distinguishing factor in in our opinion
 
04:21:21.429 --> 04:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
because they they really have to watch
 
04:21:23.469 --> 04:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
out for the client monitor their
 
04:21:25.990 --> 04:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
activities their accounts and and make
 
04:21:28.189 --> 04:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
decisions and recommendations for them
 
04:21:29.870 --> 04:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
that is in the best interest of the
 
04:21:32.189 --> 04:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
client where our enforcement sometimes
 
04:21:34.630 --> 04:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
get into gets into play is when they go
 
04:21:37.429 --> 04:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
outside you know those lines uh but more
 
04:21:41.309 --> 04:21:41.319 align:start position:0%
often than not they do a terrific job
 
04:21:43.950 --> 04:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
another function of of the bureau and it
 
04:21:46.389 --> 04:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
is uh of course the licensing and then
 
04:21:48.830 --> 04:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
an audit component and as our fact sheet
 
04:21:50.790 --> 04:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
indicates we have a little over 900
 
04:21:53.550 --> 04:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
Branch Offices here in New Hampshire and
 
04:21:56.349 --> 04:21:56.359 align:start position:0%
we conducts audits of those offices on
 
04:22:00.389 --> 04:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
an unannounced basis um and uh we'll
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
look at the operation of that firm uh to
 
04:22:04.990 --> 04:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
make sure again that they're complying
 
04:22:06.510 --> 04:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
with the law could be
 
04:22:08.910 --> 04:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
advertising uh maintenance of their
 
04:22:11.469 --> 04:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
client records uh and in a variety of
 
04:22:14.189 --> 04:22:14.199 align:start position:0%
other matters invest advisors uh have
 
04:22:18.149 --> 04:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
far more uh requirements in terms of uh
 
04:22:20.710 --> 04:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
just by virtue of what they do uh but we
 
04:22:23.149 --> 04:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
do examine each and every one of those
 
04:22:25.309 --> 04:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
offices and that number is expanding by
 
04:22:27.189 --> 04:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
the way because as you know a lot of
 
04:22:30.670 --> 04:22:30.680 align:start position:0%
firms not only uh Private Industry and
 
04:22:32.349 --> 04:22:32.359 align:start position:0%
brokerage but a lot of people have
 
04:22:34.830 --> 04:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
actually now gone to remote working so
 
04:22:36.189 --> 04:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
we have a number of Representatives
 
04:22:38.269 --> 04:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
working from their homes so that has
 
04:22:40.630 --> 04:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
expanded the number of offices uh that
 
04:22:43.710 --> 04:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
we uh that we do review
 
04:22:45.990 --> 04:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
those are two primary areas of of the
 
04:22:48.830 --> 04:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
bureau a more significant I I consider a
 
04:22:51.269 --> 04:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
much more significant part of what we do
 
04:22:54.309 --> 04:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh is enforcement and attorney fory our
 
04:22:56.670 --> 04:22:56.680 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary uh leads the the
 
04:22:59.590 --> 04:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement area and like to ask Eric if
 
04:23:01.710 --> 04:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
you'd like to just comment on on our
 
04:23:01.720 --> 04:23:03.030 align:start position:0%
you'd like to just comment on on our
enforcement

04:23:03.030 --> 04:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
04:23:06.149 --> 04:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
Activity thank you Barry I've been with
 
04:23:08.309 --> 04:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
the Securities Bureau since 2010 so
 
04:23:10.349 --> 04:23:10.359 align:start position:0%
going on 15 years it's always been with
 
04:23:11.710 --> 04:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office as long
 
04:23:12.990 --> 04:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
as I've been there
 
04:23:15.030 --> 04:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
it works it belongs there thank you
 
04:23:16.429 --> 04:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
representative hunt for your efforts in
 
04:23:20.750 --> 04:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:23.590 --> 04:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
believe maybe it was late 90s okay so
 
04:23:25.469 --> 04:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
the enforcement mechanism of the
 
04:23:26.670 --> 04:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
Securities Bureau is a very important
 
04:23:28.109 --> 04:23:28.119 align:start position:0%
one I'm very passionate about it I've
 
04:23:31.109 --> 04:23:31.119 align:start position:0%
been doing it for nearly 15 years and
 
04:23:32.870 --> 04:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
our job in the enforcement side is to
 
04:23:36.109 --> 04:23:36.119 align:start position:0%
enforce compliance with the statute RSA
 
04:23:38.389 --> 04:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
421b the legislature has provided us a
 
04:23:40.469 --> 04:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
lot of tools to do so we have a lot of
 
04:23:42.870 --> 04:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement Authority we have the um
 
04:23:45.109 --> 04:23:45.119 align:start position:0%
write to subpoena uh both documents and
 
04:23:46.670 --> 04:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
testimony from people located in New
 
04:23:48.710 --> 04:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we have ways to get people
 
04:23:50.830 --> 04:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
out of New Hampshire as well uh we have
 
04:23:55.070 --> 04:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of tools to force compliance um
 
04:23:56.309 --> 04:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
the only way to really do it on the
 
04:23:58.149 --> 04:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement side is to file a suit
 
04:23:59.870 --> 04:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
against them whether it's in civil court
 
04:24:02.070 --> 04:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
or administratively we file enforcement
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
actions to bring compliance if a
 
04:24:05.710 --> 04:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
resolution cannot be met now we always
 
04:24:07.590 --> 04:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
try to bring resolution when we can it
 
04:24:09.189 --> 04:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
does save time and resources but if we
 
04:24:10.710 --> 04:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
can't the ultimate tool the ultimate
 
04:24:12.630 --> 04:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
Hammer is an enforcement action again
 
04:24:14.870 --> 04:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
whether administratively or in Superior
 
04:24:16.109 --> 04:24:16.119 align:start position:0%
Court or
 
04:24:19.429 --> 04:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
both so as Barry alluded to there are
 
04:24:21.030 --> 04:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
licensed investment advisers and broker
 
04:24:23.189 --> 04:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
dealers that we enforce the Securities
 
04:24:24.950 --> 04:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
laws against but then there is a world
 
04:24:26.830 --> 04:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
of Securities transactions that not
 
04:24:28.109 --> 04:24:28.119 align:start position:0%
everybody appreciates that we also
 
04:24:30.189 --> 04:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
regulate our job is to regulate all
 
04:24:31.790 --> 04:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
Securities transactions in New Hampshire
 
04:24:33.349 --> 04:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
not just ones that people are used to
 
04:24:35.309 --> 04:24:35.319 align:start position:0%
hearing from their Brokers and their
 
04:24:37.510 --> 04:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
investment advisors but any sale of a
 
04:24:40.149 --> 04:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
security and the legislature has defined
 
04:24:42.389 --> 04:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
security to be very Broad and includes
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
whole array of uh business transactions
 
04:24:46.389 --> 04:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
that not everybody appreciates involves
 
04:24:49.389 --> 04:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
the sale of security for example if you
 
04:24:51.030 --> 04:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
start an LLC in New Hampshire and you
 
04:24:52.670 --> 04:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
sell interest membership interest in
 
04:24:54.429 --> 04:24:54.439 align:start position:0%
that LLC to another person that's the
 
04:24:56.630 --> 04:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
sale of a security so a big part of our
 
04:24:59.349 --> 04:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement world is routine sales
 
04:25:01.750 --> 04:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
practice cases or frauds and everything
 
04:25:04.149 --> 04:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
in between with our licensed agents and
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
then the other half of our world is
 
04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
those that are unlicensed perhaps they
 
04:25:08.990 --> 04:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
should be licensed perhaps they don't
 
04:25:10.670 --> 04:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
need to but there's a whole other world
 
04:25:11.750 --> 04:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire where you're selling
 
04:25:13.870 --> 04:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
securities and they're also within our
 
04:25:15.550 --> 04:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
purview and we get a lot of cases like
 
04:25:17.109 --> 04:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
that so you have the licensed world and
 
04:25:21.149 --> 04:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
sort of the unlicensed world and
 
04:25:24.070 --> 04:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
so we have about six attorneys that work
 
04:25:26.550 --> 04:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
on enforcement in our office three are
 
04:25:29.070 --> 04:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
strictly enforcement three have as you
 
04:25:30.590 --> 04:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
can expect in a small agency multiple
 
04:25:32.710 --> 04:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
roles but we have at any given day
 
04:25:34.109 --> 04:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
around half a dozen attorneys that are
 
04:25:36.429 --> 04:25:36.439 align:start position:0%
working on enforcement just to give you
 
04:25:39.349 --> 04:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
a sense of the numbers we have um a
 
04:25:41.710 --> 04:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
really good working relationship with
 
04:25:43.990 --> 04:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
the insurance department here in the
 
04:25:45.630 --> 04:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
state the banking department and you
 
04:25:46.990 --> 04:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
heard from Brendan Gard the Consumer
 
04:25:49.030 --> 04:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency we work very closely
 
04:25:50.510 --> 04:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
with them as well in fact there's a
 
04:25:52.510 --> 04:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
statute that requires us to meet on a
 
04:25:55.030 --> 04:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
periodic basis and I think
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative hunt recognizes that
 
04:25:57.670 --> 04:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
statute I think it's 21 years that was
 
04:25:59.790 --> 04:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
created after frm oh you brought up
 
04:26:02.510 --> 04:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
those words um yes after ever since I
 
04:26:04.910 --> 04:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
think 2011 or 12 there was a statute
 
04:26:06.349 --> 04:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
that requires us to meet periodically
 
04:26:08.149 --> 04:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
and we do and uh we don't just meet
 
04:26:10.070 --> 04:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
periodically because of a statute we
 
04:26:12.309 --> 04:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
routinely work with them on cases
 
04:26:14.389 --> 04:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
because oftentimes there are products or
 
04:26:16.870 --> 04:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
fact patterns that involve possibly
 
04:26:18.790 --> 04:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
Banking and securities or Insurance
 
04:26:21.149 --> 04:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
insecurities and so we're often working
 
04:26:22.990 --> 04:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
together required to meet periodically
 
04:26:25.469 --> 04:26:25.479 align:start position:0%
but meeting even more often as as cases
 
04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
present themselves we also work very
 
04:26:29.349 --> 04:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
closely with the criminal authorities
 
04:26:31.550 --> 04:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
again with Brandon gard's uh Consumer
 
04:26:33.030 --> 04:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau they have a criminal
 
04:26:35.229 --> 04:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
component to it and we have we're proud
 
04:26:36.910 --> 04:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
of many cases that we've brought with
 
04:26:38.429 --> 04:26:38.439 align:start position:0%
Brandon's group and I say with because
 
04:26:40.510 --> 04:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
we'll act as the agency that refers to
 
04:26:42.349 --> 04:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
criminal matter but then we'll stay on
 
04:26:44.229 --> 04:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
will be fact Witnesses I've been asked
 
04:26:45.910 --> 04:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
to testify as an expert in some matters
 
04:26:47.790 --> 04:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
so we don't just refer matters to the
 
04:26:50.670 --> 04:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
doj we work with them and and making
 
04:26:51.910 --> 04:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
sure that people who violate the
 
04:26:53.830 --> 04:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
criminal statutes are also held
 
04:26:56.189 --> 04:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
accountable so that's another big facet
 
04:26:57.309 --> 04:26:57.319 align:start position:0%
it's not just the New Hampshire
 
04:26:58.550 --> 04:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice we have a great
 
04:27:00.349 --> 04:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
working relationship with the US
 
04:27:02.349 --> 04:27:02.359 align:start position:0%
attorney's office to bring cases that
 
04:27:04.550 --> 04:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
violate federal law and with them we
 
04:27:06.510 --> 04:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
work with the FBI and so we have some
 
04:27:08.109 --> 04:27:08.119 align:start position:0%
great counterparts in the Federal
 
04:27:12.389 --> 04:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
Criminal um agencies as well and civil
 
04:27:13.990 --> 04:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
agencies the Securities and Exchange
 
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
Commission uh there's some overlap in
 
04:27:17.429 --> 04:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
our regulation with the federal
 
04:27:19.269 --> 04:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
government and we work really closely
 
04:27:20.750 --> 04:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
with the Securities and Exchange
 
04:27:22.510 --> 04:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
Commission on matters that touch both of
 
04:27:25.149 --> 04:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
our laws um mostly the Boston field
 
04:27:27.510 --> 04:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
office where we've really worked closely
 
04:27:29.309 --> 04:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
on a number of matters that I could talk
 
04:27:32.469 --> 04:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
at length about um we're a part of the
 
04:27:34.710 --> 04:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
North American Securities administrators
 
04:27:37.149 --> 04:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
Association known as NASA not the fun
 
04:27:38.309 --> 04:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
NASA that everybody knows about there's
 
04:27:41.229 --> 04:27:41.239 align:start position:0%
an extra a on the end um but that is a
 
04:27:42.950 --> 04:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
conglomerate of State Regulators it's
 
04:27:45.990 --> 04:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
every single state in in the US is a
 
04:27:47.870 --> 04:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
part of this organization as well as
 
04:27:50.309 --> 04:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
Canada Mexico and some certain
 
04:27:52.630 --> 04:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
territories like Puerto Rico Guam and we
 
04:27:54.269 --> 04:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
all come together and it's a really
 
04:27:56.429 --> 04:27:56.439 align:start position:0%
great way to bring cases that cross
 
04:27:59.109 --> 04:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
borders so we um all of the professional
 
04:28:01.030 --> 04:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
staff in our office play a role with
 
04:28:02.429 --> 04:28:02.439 align:start position:0%
NASA whether they're serving on
 
04:28:04.309 --> 04:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
committees or working on multi-state
 
04:28:06.269 --> 04:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
matters we work really closely with that
 
04:28:08.229 --> 04:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
National Organization to help each other
 
04:28:09.910 --> 04:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
not reinvent the wheel on cases of
 
04:28:11.830 --> 04:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
mutual interest or issues that others
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
have seen seen before so we have a real
 
04:28:15.910 --> 04:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
good uh role there and relationship
 
04:28:17.550 --> 04:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
there and the only other agency I wanted
 
04:28:19.910 --> 04:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
to mention is known as the fin finra the
 
04:28:22.309 --> 04:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
financial industry regulatory Authority
 
04:28:23.950 --> 04:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
that's a self-regulatory agency that has
 
04:28:25.990 --> 04:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
some overlapping jurisdiction with our
 
04:28:27.429 --> 04:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
office as well so there's a number of
 
04:28:28.990 --> 04:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
agencies that have to work together that
 
04:28:30.990 --> 04:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
should work together to bring compliance
 
04:28:33.149 --> 04:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
with the Hampshire Securities laws and
 
04:28:34.750 --> 04:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
every year we have a number of cases
 
04:28:36.830 --> 04:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
that we're either bringing on our own or
 
04:28:38.510 --> 04:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
we're bring it in conjunction with other
 
04:28:41.030 --> 04:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
states um that's the overview of
 
04:28:43.229 --> 04:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement we're really proud of that
 
04:28:46.070 --> 04:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
of that function of our office and you
 
04:28:47.469 --> 04:28:47.479 align:start position:0%
probably read in the papers about
 
04:28:49.189 --> 04:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
various cases we've taken and there are
 
04:28:52.389 --> 04:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
many more in the pipeline we uh we have
 
04:28:54.070 --> 04:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
a lot going on in the office um the
 
04:28:56.389 --> 04:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
other part of our office is pooled Risk
 
04:28:58.990 --> 04:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
Management Programs nothing to do with
 
04:29:01.389 --> 04:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
Securities necessarily but it does uh it
 
04:29:03.149 --> 04:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
is housed in our office and it's a very
 
04:29:04.429 --> 04:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
important function pulled Risk
 
04:29:07.109 --> 04:29:07.119 align:start position:0%
Management Programs RSA
 
04:29:11.790 --> 04:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
5B is the statutory mechanism by which
 
04:29:13.269 --> 04:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
police itical subdivisions can pull
 
04:29:14.710 --> 04:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
their money together to purchase
 
04:29:16.950 --> 04:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
insurance and that statute's been around
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
since the 80s and we were given
 
04:29:21.389 --> 04:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement authorities beginning in I
 
04:29:23.550 --> 04:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
want to say around 2009 and there are
 
04:29:25.630 --> 04:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
four pooled risk management programs in
 
04:29:27.469 --> 04:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and they are responsible
 
04:29:30.030 --> 04:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
for hundreds of millions of dollars of
 
04:29:31.830 --> 04:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
political subdivision money being pulled
 
04:29:33.590 --> 04:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
together for the purpose of purchasing
 
04:29:37.149 --> 04:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
insurance and there's a lot of um parts
 
04:29:38.710 --> 04:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
of the statute that give a great benefit
 
04:29:41.630 --> 04:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
to 5B programs that allow them to have a
 
04:29:43.070 --> 04:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
cheaper price there's power in numbers
 
04:29:44.510 --> 04:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
when you pull your money together to buy
 
04:29:46.710 --> 04:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
something generally you have a better uh
 
04:29:48.109 --> 04:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
price if you pull your resources
 
04:29:50.229 --> 04:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
together so that's where we come in and
 
04:29:52.750 --> 04:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
we regulate and ensure that that market
 
04:29:55.389 --> 04:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
is uh functioning as it should be and
 
04:29:57.349 --> 04:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
that includes reviewing annual filings
 
04:29:59.030 --> 04:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
these pooled RIS management programs are
 
04:30:01.349 --> 04:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
required to provide us with audited
 
04:30:03.229 --> 04:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
financial statements and Actuarial
 
04:30:05.469 --> 04:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
reports on an annual basis and we have
 
04:30:07.630 --> 04:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
another we have another broad set of
 
04:30:10.149 --> 04:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
tools uh provided by the legislature to
 
04:30:12.510 --> 04:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
investigate and bring compliance with
 
04:30:14.590 --> 04:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
um RSA 5B and there's a number of cases
 
04:30:17.109 --> 04:30:17.119 align:start position:0%
we've had in the past 15 years um that
 
04:30:19.870 --> 04:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
some of you may know about in that area
 
04:30:22.590 --> 04:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
and that regulatory Authority those um
 
04:30:24.790 --> 04:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
that ongoing monitoring and compliance
 
04:30:26.830 --> 04:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh continues and that's a whole other
 
04:30:28.389 --> 04:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
could spend an hour talking about that
 
04:30:30.349 --> 04:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
but that's another area of our of our
 
04:30:32.109 --> 04:30:32.119 align:start position:0%
office that we're very proud of that is
 
04:30:34.469 --> 04:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
a very important role and a lot of money
 
04:30:36.389 --> 04:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
flowing through um that's a broad
 
04:30:37.790 --> 04:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
overview of the two topics I'm happy to
 
04:30:39.309 --> 04:30:39.319 align:start position:0%
take questions just not about cases that
 
04:30:39.319 --> 04:30:40.630 align:start position:0%
take questions just not about cases that
are

04:30:40.630 --> 04:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:30:43.510 --> 04:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
pending perfect I'm glad you did bring
 
04:30:45.910 --> 04:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
up the P risk because that that
 
04:30:47.550 --> 04:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
legislation all came through through
 
04:30:50.590 --> 04:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
this committee also so thank you
 
04:30:50.600 --> 04:30:53.349 align:start position:0%
this committee also so thank you
represent

04:30:53.349 --> 04:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:56.870 --> 04:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
spe as the role of cryptocurrency gets
 
04:31:00.309 --> 04:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
evolves in with Securities and as it's
 
04:31:02.389 --> 04:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
being defined at the federal level will
 
04:31:05.630 --> 04:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
you be getting involved in in uh cases
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
of the various kinds of frauds that
 
04:31:10.189 --> 04:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
happen with cryptocurrencies and things
 
04:31:12.590 --> 04:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
like that thank you for the question
 
04:31:16.109 --> 04:31:16.119 align:start position:0%
great question cryptocurrency is a topic
 
04:31:18.149 --> 04:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
of of a lot of interest amongst retail
 
04:31:20.189 --> 04:31:20.199 align:start position:0%
investors when
 
04:31:22.510 --> 04:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
um retail investors start looking at
 
04:31:23.710 --> 04:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
something very carefully that's where
 
04:31:25.349 --> 04:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
our role comes in because it's very
 
04:31:27.269 --> 04:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
popular right now and so we need to make
 
04:31:29.030 --> 04:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
sure that in New Hampshire that we're
 
04:31:30.990 --> 04:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
fostering Economic Development while
 
04:31:33.469 --> 04:31:33.479 align:start position:0%
balancing investor protection our job is
 
04:31:35.349 --> 04:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
investor protection we recognize
 
04:31:38.070 --> 04:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
fostering Capital formation is the other
 
04:31:40.229 --> 04:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
part of our job it's a balance and so we
 
04:31:42.510 --> 04:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
have had cases in the past that our our
 
04:31:44.189 --> 04:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
office has brought related to
 
04:31:46.910 --> 04:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency frauds we've brought that
 
04:31:48.950 --> 04:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
by ourselves in cases of a I'm thinking
 
04:31:50.309 --> 04:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
of one in particular where a complaint
 
04:31:52.630 --> 04:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
came in uh related to cryptocurrency
 
04:31:54.109 --> 04:31:54.119 align:start position:0%
investing and we brought that case to
 
04:31:56.590 --> 04:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
its conclusion we're also I talked about
 
04:31:58.790 --> 04:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
NASA earlier and you asked a question of
 
04:32:00.870 --> 04:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
Mr Gerard about how do you handle with
 
04:32:02.030 --> 04:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
matters that are outside of New
 
04:32:03.309 --> 04:32:03.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and online well that's the
 
04:32:05.269 --> 04:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency world and so having
 
04:32:06.349 --> 04:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
relationships with the federal
 
04:32:08.070 --> 04:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
government and through NASA and other
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
states is another way to tackle that and
 
04:32:12.550 --> 04:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
there are cases that are brought by
 
04:32:14.870 --> 04:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
um their multi-state enforcement actions
 
04:32:16.710 --> 04:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
where many states come together and
 
04:32:18.550 --> 04:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
investigate and bring cases against
 
04:32:20.309 --> 04:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency matters we have a few
 
04:32:22.389 --> 04:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
settlements like that in the past and I
 
04:32:23.750 --> 04:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
won't speak about pending matters but it
 
04:32:26.550 --> 04:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
is a Hot Topic and both us and the
 
04:32:28.830 --> 04:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
industry and the conglomerate State
 
04:32:30.870 --> 04:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
Regulators are all looking at it and I
 
04:32:31.910 --> 04:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
understand there'll be more legislation
 
04:32:34.710 --> 04:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
coming in if we have legislation with
 
04:32:36.429 --> 04:32:36.439 align:start position:0%
respect to that you are the guys we go
 
04:32:38.070 --> 04:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
and talk to we are definitely one of the
 
04:32:39.469 --> 04:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
players that would be testifying about
 
04:32:41.229 --> 04:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
bills that impact cryptocurrencies and
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
we look forward to working with this
 
04:32:44.630 --> 04:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
committee through any bills that touch
 
04:32:45.910 --> 04:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
upon the Securities Bureau
 
04:32:48.269 --> 04:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency is a very broad term um
 
04:32:52.149 --> 04:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
so it depends on the the details so but
 
04:32:54.790 --> 04:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
given because we have no regulatory
 
04:32:56.710 --> 04:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
statute anything like this point it
 
04:32:59.189 --> 04:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
would right now be under the a AG's
 
04:33:01.550 --> 04:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
office consumer protection in terms if
 
04:33:03.469 --> 04:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
somebody had a problem or a complaint
 
04:33:05.470 --> 04:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
about that's that's where you would be
 
04:33:08.390 --> 04:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
taking it at this point would you agree
 
04:33:09.910 --> 04:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
with that or to some extent depending on
 
04:33:11.109 --> 04:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
the nature of the complaint there is an
 
04:33:13.109 --> 04:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
exemption in the consumer protection act
 
04:33:14.670 --> 04:33:14.680 align:start position:0%
for those involving security so it
 
04:33:16.670 --> 04:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
really depends on again cryptocurrency a
 
04:33:19.869 --> 04:33:19.879 align:start position:0%
broad term used very broadly and if a
 
04:33:20.949 --> 04:33:20.959 align:start position:0%
complaint came in like that I'd be
 
04:33:22.070 --> 04:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
working with Brendon Gard at the
 
04:33:23.670 --> 04:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection Bureau to figure out
 
04:33:25.390 --> 04:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
where our jurisdiction lies yeah but I
 
04:33:26.910 --> 04:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
think when when we had the bank when we
 
04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
had it in Banks we were we clearly
 
04:33:32.230 --> 04:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
defined that it was not a security that
 
04:33:33.670 --> 04:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
04:33:36.070 --> 04:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
commodity and therefore it would not
 
04:33:37.830 --> 04:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
have the privilege of being exempt from
 
04:33:40.551 --> 04:33:40.561 align:start position:0%
the Securities division but maybe that's
 
04:33:44.429 --> 04:33:44.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:47.990 --> 04:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay oh represent pelli thank you for
 
04:33:50.670 --> 04:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question so commod uh
 
04:33:53.470 --> 04:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
Securities trading is a commodity online
 
04:33:56.349 --> 04:33:56.359 align:start position:0%
many firms are now online so how do you
 
04:33:59.230 --> 04:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
deal with Robo advisers that are really
 
04:34:02.629 --> 04:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
just a algorithm is that a challenge for
 
04:34:02.639 --> 04:34:05.510 align:start position:0%
just a algorithm is that a challenge for
your

04:34:05.510 --> 04:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:07.750 --> 04:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
office representative I if I could just
 
04:34:09.709 --> 04:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
ask for clarification at the very end
 
04:34:11.070 --> 04:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
the the type of advisor you were
 
04:34:13.551 --> 04:34:13.561 align:start position:0%
referring to at at the end those uh Robo
 
04:34:16.029 --> 04:34:16.039 align:start position:0%
advisor you know it's just an algorithm
 
04:34:18.910 --> 04:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
and it's rebalancing your portfolio and
 
04:34:21.150 --> 04:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
you know there's no person on the other
 
04:34:23.990 --> 04:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
end it's a algorithm computer algorithm
 
04:34:27.310 --> 04:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
well um actually there is someone at the
 
04:34:29.150 --> 04:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
other end there is somebody who's I
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
would say pulling the strings behind the
 
04:34:33.869 --> 04:34:33.879 align:start position:0%
robo advisor the one who's actually
 
04:34:37.869 --> 04:34:37.879 align:start position:0%
creating the algorithms um a lot of even
 
04:34:40.789 --> 04:34:40.799 align:start position:0%
larger uh Securities firms uh in in the
 
04:34:44.910 --> 04:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
country have a um Robo type platform so
 
04:34:48.230 --> 04:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
it it's not new uh to uh firms that have
 
04:34:50.310 --> 04:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
been around for quite some time we still
 
04:34:53.150 --> 04:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
hold the the the firm or the individual
 
04:34:56.070 --> 04:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
behind that algorithm responsible uh if
 
04:34:59.629 --> 04:34:59.639 align:start position:0%
something were to go Ary um I I think a
 
04:35:01.189 --> 04:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
concern that we have is to make sure
 
04:35:03.269 --> 04:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
that there's adequate disclosure to the
 
04:35:04.629 --> 04:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
client that they know exactly what
 
04:35:07.349 --> 04:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
they're getting into that perhaps a a
 
04:35:09.470 --> 04:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
robo adviser may not be able to respond
 
04:35:12.349 --> 04:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
as quickly as someone uh who's seated
 
04:35:14.189 --> 04:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
right here in New Hampshire uh advising
 
04:35:16.830 --> 04:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
the client um so there there are certain
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
risks uh with that it's untested in some
 
04:35:21.470 --> 04:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
areas and then if I may just kind of
 
04:35:24.189 --> 04:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
expand a little bit uh the other area is
 
04:35:25.629 --> 04:35:25.639 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence which we're
 
04:35:27.269 --> 04:35:27.279 align:start position:0%
hearing more and more about and we're
 
04:35:30.789 --> 04:35:30.799 align:start position:0%
seeing uh that term uh being touted in
 
04:35:33.510 --> 04:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
the world of of Investments and so our
 
04:35:36.910 --> 04:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
concern right now is to make sure that
 
04:35:38.949 --> 04:35:38.959 align:start position:0%
if a firm is saying that or an
 
04:35:41.029 --> 04:35:41.039 align:start position:0%
individual representative is saying that
 
04:35:44.470 --> 04:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
well we we are supported by AI or AI is
 
04:35:45.910 --> 04:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
supporting some of the financial
 
04:35:47.349 --> 04:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
decisions that we're making on your
 
04:35:49.230 --> 04:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
behalf we want to make sure that there
 
04:35:52.470 --> 04:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
is actually U an AI technology behind
 
04:35:54.629 --> 04:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
that because what we're seeing is quite
 
04:35:56.590 --> 04:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
often there's not it's just a little bit
 
04:35:56.600 --> 04:35:57.230 align:start position:0%
often there's not it's just a little bit
of

04:35:57.230 --> 04:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:36:00.150 --> 04:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
hyperbole uh it sounds great um it
 
04:36:01.750 --> 04:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's Cutting Edge but we
 
04:36:03.869 --> 04:36:03.879 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that there is in fact
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
you know that that technology uh out
 
04:36:07.390 --> 04:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
there and that it's actually being
 
04:36:10.590 --> 04:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
provided so and if I may Mr chair
 
04:36:12.390 --> 04:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
because in the interest of time we have
 
04:36:14.629 --> 04:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
just one other component and if I uh
 
04:36:16.230 --> 04:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
could approach with some investor
 
04:36:17.590 --> 04:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
education materials to the members of
 
04:36:21.470 --> 04:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
the committee pass yes okay we love
 
04:36:24.150 --> 04:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
literature thank you U and there's
 
04:36:25.830 --> 04:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely no charge for this all of
 
04:36:27.910 --> 04:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
these materials have been paid for by
 
04:36:30.189 --> 04:36:30.199 align:start position:0%
fines and penalties imposed by The
 
04:36:33.269 --> 04:36:33.279 align:start position:0%
Bureau uh and that's the the absolute
 
04:36:34.670 --> 04:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
trth you've done very well with fines
 
04:36:37.230 --> 04:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
and penalties yes we we U we have been
 
04:36:40.629 --> 04:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
very lucrative so one an important
 
04:36:42.230 --> 04:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
component of the bureau is investor
 
04:36:44.789 --> 04:36:44.799 align:start position:0%
education as I mentioned before uh New
 
04:36:47.670 --> 04:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire being a wealth Center um and
 
04:36:49.990 --> 04:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh where assets are you know assets are
 
04:36:51.869 --> 04:36:51.879 align:start position:0%
here in the state and there are certain
 
04:36:53.470 --> 04:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
segments of the population that are more
 
04:36:56.349 --> 04:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
vulnerable than others and uh seniors
 
04:36:59.109 --> 04:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
are in fact you know a a part of that
 
04:37:01.670 --> 04:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
population so we do a fair amount of
 
04:37:04.869 --> 04:37:04.879 align:start position:0%
Outreach to uh senior organizations uh
 
04:37:07.109 --> 04:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
lifelong learning programs trying to
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
reach seniors and advise them inform
 
04:37:12.029 --> 04:37:12.039 align:start position:0%
them of uh investment fraud scams that
 
04:37:13.949 --> 04:37:13.959 align:start position:0%
are taking place in New Hampshire but
 
04:37:17.109 --> 04:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
we're also expanding our message to
 
04:37:18.990 --> 04:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
other segments of the population and
 
04:37:20.670 --> 04:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
what I would call the Middle Market and
 
04:37:22.830 --> 04:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
that would be Civic organizations you
 
04:37:24.709 --> 04:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
know comprised largely of individuals
 
04:37:28.189 --> 04:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
business owners uh people who also um
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
have assets who are approached that are
 
04:37:33.189 --> 04:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh also in a position we making
 
04:37:35.189 --> 04:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
decisions every day and perhaps even
 
04:37:37.109 --> 04:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
making investment decisions without
 
04:37:39.310 --> 04:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
taking into consideration all the
 
04:37:42.109 --> 04:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
factors um also younger population
 
04:37:44.510 --> 04:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
younger population is a concern for us
 
04:37:46.629 --> 04:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
those entering the workforce so as
 
04:37:49.269 --> 04:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
you'll see before you uh we developed um
 
04:37:50.590 --> 04:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
under the direction of secretary
 
04:37:53.150 --> 04:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
scanland and Deputy Hennessy uh
 
04:37:55.189 --> 04:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
developed a New Hampshire investor guide
 
04:37:57.709 --> 04:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
which is I think a terrific piece um
 
04:38:00.390 --> 04:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
we've provided a copy to all
 
04:38:03.070 --> 04:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh as well as Senators
 
04:38:05.349 --> 04:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh describing the industry all the the
 
04:38:05.359 --> 04:38:06.269 align:start position:0%
uh describing the industry all the the
various

04:38:06.269 --> 04:38:06.279 align:start position:0%
various
 
04:38:09.029 --> 04:38:09.039 align:start position:0%
terminology um basic information about
 
04:38:11.629 --> 04:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
investing the types of products but also
 
04:38:14.310 --> 04:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
to be concerned about in terms of scams
 
04:38:16.189 --> 04:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
uh questions to ask financial
 
04:38:17.470 --> 04:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
professionals when you're when you're
 
04:38:20.429 --> 04:38:20.439 align:start position:0%
considering uh retaining one we've also
 
04:38:21.789 --> 04:38:21.799 align:start position:0%
expanded that you'll notice there are a
 
04:38:24.551 --> 04:38:24.561 align:start position:0%
couple other uh pieces in in there I'll
 
04:38:26.830 --> 04:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
point one out in particular that that we
 
04:38:30.310 --> 04:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
developed called marriage and money uh
 
04:38:32.029 --> 04:38:32.039 align:start position:0%
which you know but believe it or not
 
04:38:34.029 --> 04:38:34.039 align:start position:0%
when you marry there are so many
 
04:38:36.109 --> 04:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
different considerations that you have
 
04:38:38.750 --> 04:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind uh that is uh what
 
04:38:41.230 --> 04:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
happens to debt you know joint debt or
 
04:38:44.629 --> 04:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
or how is that held um modifying your
 
04:38:46.510 --> 04:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
your your governmental documents you
 
04:38:48.990 --> 04:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
know make actually changing your name uh
 
04:38:51.629 --> 04:38:51.639 align:start position:0%
considerations about insurance a number
 
04:38:54.750 --> 04:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
of financial uh factors that were were
 
04:38:57.070 --> 04:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
targeting uh newly married couples and
 
04:38:59.349 --> 04:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
providing them this information making
 
04:39:01.150 --> 04:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
it available to city and town clerks
 
04:39:02.269 --> 04:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
throughout the state because that's
 
04:39:04.390 --> 04:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
where you get your marriage license uh
 
04:39:06.590 --> 04:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
second is your new job uh this is a
 
04:39:08.390 --> 04:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
brand new piece along with working with

financial professionals your new job is
 
04:39:13.830 --> 04:39:13.840 align:start position:0%

graduates or those soon to graduate and
 
04:39:18.189 --> 04:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
all the considerations when you begin a
 
04:39:20.349 --> 04:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
new job pension if there is a pension
 
04:39:23.949 --> 04:39:23.959 align:start position:0%

all these other Financial considerations
 
04:39:31.709 --> 04:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
that are not necessarily geared toward
 
04:39:33.629 --> 04:39:33.639 align:start position:0%
financial fraud but just making
 
04:39:35.789 --> 04:39:35.799 align:start position:0%
important financial decisions that's
 
04:39:38.190 --> 04:39:38.200 align:start position:0%

Hampshire all these years recognizing
 
04:40:55.390 --> 04:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
the importance of the of each of of the
 
04:40:57.670 --> 04:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
state agencies whether banking Insurance
 
04:41:01.310 --> 04:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
Securities but also uh the concept of
 
04:41:03.550 --> 04:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
exclusive jurisdiction over their

handout in front of you
 
04:43:15.110 --> 04:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh which is our updated primer for
 
04:43:18.070 --> 04:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
2025 so we'll start out on page two
 
04:43:21.110 --> 04:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
listing that there's uh 17 control
 
04:43:24.550 --> 04:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions in the United States and
 
04:43:26.788 --> 04:43:26.798 align:start position:0%
of course Maine and Vermont are two as
 
04:43:28.550 --> 04:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
well our neighboring
 
04:43:31.750 --> 04:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
states uh the three tier system on page
 
04:43:34.590 --> 04:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
three which includes the manufacturing
 
04:43:36.670 --> 04:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
tier wholesale what what are the black
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
spots on the control
 
04:43:42.110 --> 04:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
states do those like certain cities or
 
04:43:44.868 --> 04:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
something have local control or those
 
04:43:47.230 --> 04:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
just accidentals like Minnesota
 
04:43:51.990 --> 04:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:56.390 --> 04:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:59.750 --> 04:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
idea that map's been provided to us
 
04:44:01.868 --> 04:44:01.878 align:start position:0%
their counties their counties they're
 
04:44:04.230 --> 04:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
controlled counties okay that's what the
 
04:44:07.550 --> 04:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
chief is telling us okay he's the chief
 
04:44:10.430 --> 04:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
enforcer so we always we always believe
 
04:44:10.440 --> 04:44:12.510 align:start position:0%
enforcer so we always we always believe
him

04:44:12.510 --> 04:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
him
 
04:44:16.550 --> 04:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay sorry sorry to uh no that's
 
04:44:19.350 --> 04:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
04:44:22.868 --> 04:44:22.878 align:start position:0%
information who do so on page four we
 
04:44:24.910 --> 04:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
got quickly into the value of the three-
 
04:44:29.628 --> 04:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
tier system and uh just as part of the
 
04:44:32.190 --> 04:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
three-tier system product tracking is
 
04:44:34.070 --> 04:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
the biggest piece of the three-tier
 
04:44:36.590 --> 04:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
system uh which prevents the sale of
 
04:44:39.550 --> 04:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
Tainted and counterfeit alcohol and just
 
04:44:43.070 --> 04:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
for uh uh just just for a note methanol
 
04:44:45.830 --> 04:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
which is included is industrial cleaning
 
04:44:48.550 --> 04:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
products is the biggest piece of Tainted
 
04:44:52.190 --> 04:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
alcohol and last year in 2024 worldwide
 
04:44:55.590 --> 04:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
1200 people were affected and 400 people
 
04:44:57.708 --> 04:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
died from tainted
 
04:45:02.590 --> 04:45:02.600 align:start position:0%
alcohol u in the past five years 11,800
 
04:45:04.310 --> 04:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
people have been affected by tainted
 
04:45:07.070 --> 04:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
alcohol again containing methanol and
 
04:45:09.628 --> 04:45:09.638 align:start position:0%
4500 people have
 
04:45:11.590 --> 04:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
died so
 
04:45:13.990 --> 04:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
when you look at our control system uh
 
04:45:17.070 --> 04:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
obviously the those stores are retail
 
04:45:19.350 --> 04:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
outlets they're there for the buying
 
04:45:21.708 --> 04:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
public but they're also a control piece
 
04:45:23.430 --> 04:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
so everything that goes through those
 
04:45:26.390 --> 04:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
stores is tracked counted every one of
 
04:45:31.190 --> 04:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
our stores is is camera uh for a various
 
04:45:34.628 --> 04:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
reasons and part of the control model is
 
04:45:38.270 --> 04:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
keeping control of that controlled
 
04:45:42.310 --> 04:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
substance so on page five will go to
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
competition back in 2011 governor
 
04:45:47.350 --> 04:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
Patrick signed a bill which increased
 
04:45:49.510 --> 04:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
the amount of liquor licenses that could
 
04:45:51.350 --> 04:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
be held in the state of
 
04:45:53.868 --> 04:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh basically that opened
 
04:45:56.948 --> 04:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
the door for Total Wine to come into the
 
04:45:59.590 --> 04:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
to the state of Massachusetts uh total
 
04:46:01.830 --> 04:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
is our biggest competitor and they are
 
04:46:04.670 --> 04:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
the biggest Revenue producer uh in the
 
04:46:06.788 --> 04:46:06.798 align:start position:0%
nation's largest independent Wine and
 
04:46:09.310 --> 04:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
Spirits retailer they have
 
04:46:13.990 --> 04:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
277 stores in 29 States they have 11,000
 
04:46:17.470 --> 04:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
employees at this point they have eight
 
04:46:21.990 --> 04:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
2016 when they opened their first store
 
04:46:27.628 --> 04:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
and they have also opened four stores in
 
04:46:30.510 --> 04:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and that becomes significant
 
04:46:32.868 --> 04:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
uh when we break down where our business
 
04:46:35.910 --> 04:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
comes from because 25% of our business
 
04:46:39.190 --> 04:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
comes from Massachusetts and 50% of our
 
04:46:41.670 --> 04:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
business comes from crossb
 
04:46:44.590 --> 04:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
sales so on page six we'll take a look
 
04:46:47.190 --> 04:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
at the national Global factors impacting
 
04:46:50.590 --> 04:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
alcohol sales and we'll notice on the
 
04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
bottom line of the first paragraph is
 
04:46:55.470 --> 04:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
for the first time in nearly 30 years
 
04:46:57.948 --> 04:46:57.958 align:start position:0%
there's been a decline in alcohol sales
 
04:47:00.830 --> 04:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
Nationwide minus 2% in
 
04:47:05.350 --> 04:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
2023 so that's a 30-year run of increase
 
04:47:07.510 --> 04:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
and a 2% decline in
 
04:47:10.190 --> 04:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
2023 we're looking at about and that's a
 
04:47:12.830 --> 04:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
nationwide figure we're looking at about
 
04:47:12.840 --> 04:47:13.750 align:start position:0%
nationwide figure we're looking at about
a

04:47:13.750 --> 04:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:47:13.760 --> 04:47:15.270 align:start position:0%
a
5.2%

04:47:15.270 --> 04:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
5.2%
 
04:47:19.070 --> 04:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
Nationwide in 2024 and they figure it to
 
04:47:22.030 --> 04:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
level off at a total of about
 
04:47:24.350 --> 04:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
5.6% decline
 
04:47:27.750 --> 04:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:27.760 --> 04:47:29.390 align:start position:0%
 
2025

04:47:29.390 --> 04:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
2025
 
04:47:32.150 --> 04:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
so there's a few positive signs in the
 
04:47:36.590 --> 04:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
alcohol business uh obviously
 
04:47:40.830 --> 04:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
um sparkling wine beer and Al
 
04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol-free Spirits all of which we
 
04:47:47.910 --> 04:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
sell in our stores uh are seeing an
 
04:47:50.708 --> 04:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
uptick we're seeing a lot of uh dry
 
04:47:53.670 --> 04:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
January sober Octobers so there's kind
 
04:47:55.628 --> 04:47:55.638 align:start position:0%
of a lot of pressure on the Alcohol
 
04:47:59.510 --> 04:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
business uh now Nationwide and if you
 
04:48:02.310 --> 04:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
look on page seven for the first time
 
04:48:04.548 --> 04:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
more Americans are using marijuana on a
 
04:48:07.830 --> 04:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
daily basis than alcohol and uh what
 
04:48:09.708 --> 04:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
we're seeing the numbers that are out
 
04:48:14.070 --> 04:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
this year 33% of the people over the age
 
04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
of 21 last year were using cannabis in
 
04:48:19.830 --> 04:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
some shape or form this year it's gone
 
04:48:21.350 --> 04:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
up to
 
04:48:26.230 --> 04:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
44% so and anti-alcohol organizations
 
04:48:27.830 --> 04:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
such as a Neo
 
04:48:30.030 --> 04:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
prohibitionists uh and the World Health
 
04:48:32.670 --> 04:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
Organization has also now claimed that
 
04:48:35.628 --> 04:48:35.638 align:start position:0%
no level of alcohol consumption is safe
 
04:48:37.670 --> 04:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
so alcohol is under a little bit of
 
04:48:41.750 --> 04:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
attack just as part of uh
 
04:48:44.070 --> 04:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
part of our Revenue impact as
 
04:48:47.070 --> 04:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
well so on page eight we'll notice that
 
04:48:50.548 --> 04:48:50.558 align:start position:0%
the surrounding states Massachusetts has
 
04:48:53.990 --> 04:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
355 licensed retailers for cannabis and
 
04:48:55.830 --> 04:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
you can see the the numbers that they've
 
04:48:59.788 --> 04:48:59.798 align:start position:0%
done Maine has 218 licensed retailers
 
04:49:01.750 --> 04:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
and Vermont which is in their second
 
04:49:05.190 --> 04:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
year of business has 79 retailers and
 
04:49:08.430 --> 04:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
they have paused taking uh any
 
04:49:11.270 --> 04:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
additional licenses in putting licenses
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
in play so uh The Liquor Commission
 
04:49:16.708 --> 04:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't take a stand either Pro or
 
04:49:19.230 --> 04:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
against but when we see the decline of
 
04:49:21.628 --> 04:49:21.638 align:start position:0%
Revenue we have to understand where it
 
04:49:23.830 --> 04:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
comes from we're here to inform and
 
04:49:26.350 --> 04:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
support and part of the information that
 
04:49:30.030 --> 04:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
you need to have is that
 
04:49:31.948 --> 04:49:31.958 align:start position:0%
cannabis health
 
04:49:35.670 --> 04:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
impact and Baby Boomers aging out of the
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
liquor Market are three of the biggest
 
04:49:40.990 --> 04:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
pieces that are causing alcohol Hall
 
04:49:41.000 --> 04:49:43.030 align:start position:0%
pieces that are causing alcohol Hall
decline

04:49:43.030 --> 04:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
decline
 
04:49:45.948 --> 04:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
Nationwide so we can move on to an
 
04:49:49.110 --> 04:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
operational overview on page
 
04:49:59.830 --> 04:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:03.788 --> 04:50:03.798 align:start position:0%
and 56 are leased at the bottom you'll
 
04:50:06.390 --> 04:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
see that we run under and are governed
 
04:50:11.470 --> 04:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
by RSA 176 colon 3 which optimizes the
 
04:50:13.270 --> 04:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
profitability of the commission we're
 
04:50:16.030 --> 04:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
here to maintain proper controls and
 
04:50:17.868 --> 04:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
assume responsive and effective
 
04:50:21.430 --> 04:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
operation and provide service to our
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
customers we'd like to add the word
 
04:50:26.590 --> 04:50:26.600 align:start position:0%
exemplary in there so that's what we
 
04:50:28.830 --> 04:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
that's what we set out every day to do
 
04:50:31.628 --> 04:50:31.638 align:start position:0%
and in redoing our stores and Outlets
 
04:50:34.470 --> 04:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
over the years that's what was our
 
04:50:36.390 --> 04:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
vision of being able to serve our
 
04:50:36.400 --> 04:50:37.830 align:start position:0%
vision of being able to serve our
customers

04:50:37.830 --> 04:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
customers
 
04:50:40.990 --> 04:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
better on page 11 you'll see see that
 
04:50:42.948 --> 04:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
the the commission is made up of three
 
04:50:46.430 --> 04:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
divisions the organizational structure
 
04:50:48.708 --> 04:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
we have the office of the commission we
 
04:50:51.708 --> 04:50:51.718 align:start position:0%
have the division of enfor enforcement
 
04:50:54.150 --> 04:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
we have the division of administration
 
04:50:56.990 --> 04:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
and the division of marketing and
 
04:50:59.470 --> 04:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
Merchandising and the correspond
 
04:51:02.270 --> 04:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
sponding full-time positions that are
 
04:51:04.788 --> 04:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
involved in those and if you'll notice
 
04:51:06.110 --> 04:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:51:09.310 --> 04:51:09.320 align:start position:0%
285 classified positions in the division
 
04:51:12.030 --> 04:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
of marketing and merchand in all that's
 
04:51:15.190 --> 04:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
including all of our full-tim in all of
 
04:51:18.750 --> 04:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:21.070 --> 04:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
Outlets uh let's see the division
 
04:51:24.270 --> 04:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
responsibilities on page 12 uh you'll
 
04:51:28.910 --> 04:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
notice that second bullet we have 6,200
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
lenses which is under the division of uh
 
04:51:34.628 --> 04:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh we have the division of
 
04:51:37.590 --> 04:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
administration which oversees the
 
04:51:41.788 --> 04:51:41.798 align:start position:0%
finance Services doit human resources
 
04:51:44.510 --> 04:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
auditing plant maintenance inventory
 
04:51:47.190 --> 04:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
control and legal services one of the
 
04:51:49.948 --> 04:51:49.958 align:start position:0%
things that we've uh asked for this year
 
04:51:51.750 --> 04:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
which is also included in the budget
 
04:51:54.190 --> 04:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
numbers that we've put in is to break
 
04:51:56.548 --> 04:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
out the finance piece which was a
 
04:51:58.670 --> 04:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation from one of our prior
 
04:52:01.990 --> 04:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
audits to put in a Director of Finance
 
04:52:03.708 --> 04:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
so that would be broken out of the
 
04:52:06.070 --> 04:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
director of administration and those
 
04:52:10.868 --> 04:52:10.878 align:start position:0%
financial services those 22 23 people
 
04:52:13.110 --> 04:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
would be under a new Director of Finance
 
04:52:15.628 --> 04:52:15.638 align:start position:0%
and as I said that number is already
 
04:52:19.070 --> 04:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
included in the budget that we've asked
 
04:52:21.270 --> 04:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
for uh page
 
04:52:25.030 --> 04:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
13 uh NextGen project a little update on
 
04:52:28.070 --> 04:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
that NextGen is what we call the update
 
04:52:29.750 --> 04:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
of our front of the house and back of
 
04:52:31.788 --> 04:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
the house systems at The Liquor
 
04:52:35.510 --> 04:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
Commission uh we had a 40 year
 
04:52:38.750 --> 04:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
old plus or minus system which was
 
04:52:40.548 --> 04:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
called mapper which the liquor
 
04:52:43.310 --> 04:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
commission had used for many many years
 
04:52:45.868 --> 04:52:45.878 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly and openly had kicked
 
04:52:48.510 --> 04:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
the can down the road as to whether they
 
04:52:51.030 --> 04:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
would update it or not it was long
 
04:52:53.310 --> 04:52:53.320 align:start position:0%
overdue uh there was only two
 
04:52:55.350 --> 04:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
individuals working for the Liquor
 
04:52:57.670 --> 04:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
Commission which were both part-timers
 
04:53:00.310 --> 04:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
that were able to work on and adjust
 
04:53:04.590 --> 04:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
this system so we've uh certainly uh got
 
04:53:07.390 --> 04:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
our life expectancy out of that one and
 
04:53:10.510 --> 04:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
we've moved on to a new system uh with
 
04:53:15.670 --> 04:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
which is uh a Microsoft system D3
 
04:53:18.868 --> 04:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
d365 which is a cloud-based system which
 
04:53:21.788 --> 04:53:21.798 align:start position:0%
will allow the uh Liquor Commission to
 
04:53:24.190 --> 04:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
sort of step into this century and do
 
04:53:26.868 --> 04:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
the types of things that uh retailers
 
04:53:30.390 --> 04:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
are doing today uh with much more ease
 
04:53:33.150 --> 04:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a a cost that Tina
 
04:53:36.110 --> 04:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
will go into with having that system so
 
04:53:39.430 --> 04:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
we have gone from basically a zero cost
 
04:53:41.470 --> 04:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
having a couple of part timers work on a
 
04:53:46.708 --> 04:53:46.718 align:start position:0%
system to nearly uh $7 million so um
 
04:53:49.190 --> 04:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
certainly worth it in the long run but a
 
04:53:51.070 --> 04:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
big step forward for the Liquor
 
04:53:53.750 --> 04:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
Commission and uh although we're not
 
04:53:56.750 --> 04:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
seeing it in the revenues this year it's
 
04:53:59.270 --> 04:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
certainly part of the asset that we've
 
04:54:01.628 --> 04:54:01.638 align:start position:0%
created for the state in updating the
 
04:54:05.788 --> 04:54:05.798 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission so at this point I'll
 
04:54:08.190 --> 04:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
hand it over to Tina and she'll take you
 
04:54:10.868 --> 04:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
through uh the revenue trends and the
 
04:54:13.150 --> 04:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
language thank you very
 
04:54:17.590 --> 04:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
much good afternoon on page 14 you're
 
04:54:21.230 --> 04:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
going to see our uh net profit history
 
04:54:24.628 --> 04:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
the first uh graph that you see is from
 
04:54:29.070 --> 04:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
the Inception of in 1935 to 2024 we've
 
04:54:33.470 --> 04:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
provided 4.6 million to the general fund
 
04:54:37.230 --> 04:54:37.240 align:start position:0%
and in 19 I mean uh in the chart further
 
04:54:39.670 --> 04:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
below you'll see the 10-year history of
 
04:54:41.030 --> 04:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
our trend
 
04:54:46.230 --> 04:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
um in FY 24 we had uh 25.4 million less
 
04:54:48.910 --> 04:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
than in FY 23 and there are two main
 
04:54:51.868 --> 04:54:51.878 align:start position:0%
factors for this reduction you have
 
04:54:54.070 --> 04:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
first our gross profit was down by about
 
04:54:56.548 --> 04:54:56.558 align:start position:0%
7 million and this is because of the
 
04:54:59.910 --> 04:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
increase in costs in uh products and for
 
04:55:02.548 --> 04:55:02.558 align:start position:0%
an increase in discounting to try and
 
04:55:05.270 --> 04:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
try and stay competitive um and keep our
 
04:55:08.110 --> 04:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
customer base and the second we had
 
04:55:10.750 --> 04:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
increases in our expenses the expenses
 
04:55:14.470 --> 04:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
increased by uh 16.5 million and this
 
04:55:17.788 --> 04:55:17.798 align:start position:0%
primary factor was 9.5 million in
 
04:55:20.350 --> 04:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits so we had 4
 
04:55:22.868 --> 04:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
million for full-time position changes
 
04:55:24.628 --> 04:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
we had to bring in some new positions
 
04:55:28.070 --> 04:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
for the new system and then the 10% pay
 
04:55:30.030 --> 04:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
raise that went into effect for fiscal
 
04:55:30.040 --> 04:55:31.310 align:start position:0%
raise that went into effect for fiscal
year

04:55:31.310 --> 04:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:55:34.990 --> 04:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
24 yeah and then there was 3.5 million
 
04:55:37.190 --> 04:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
increase for our part-time for salaries
 
04:55:40.628 --> 04:55:40.638 align:start position:0%
and benefits and for the um rate change
 
04:55:43.310 --> 04:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
in pay so we now bring in our
 
04:55:45.750 --> 04:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
part-timers at a higher rate of pay to
 
04:55:48.670 --> 04:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
compete with other retailers and that
 
04:55:52.030 --> 04:55:52.040 align:start position:0%
had a $3.5 million impact and then
 
04:55:54.708 --> 04:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
benefits were a $2 million increase and
 
04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
then finally we had 5.5 million for
 
04:56:00.430 --> 04:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
depreciation on our new system because
 
04:56:02.310 --> 04:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
that is being depreciated over a
 
04:56:05.070 --> 04:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
five-year term so it's a a large hit in
 
04:56:07.628 --> 04:56:07.638 align:start position:0%
one year to
 
04:56:11.590 --> 04:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
start on page 15 um you're going to see
 
04:56:14.510 --> 04:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
our FY 24 actual Revenue transfer to the
 
04:56:17.030 --> 04:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
general fund and then our estimates for
 
04:56:20.948 --> 04:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
25 26 and 27 and these are all based on
 
04:56:22.270 --> 04:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
the current
 
04:56:26.030 --> 04:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
trends Row one has net revenue um it's
 
04:56:28.948 --> 04:56:28.958 align:start position:0%
down in fy2 but is projected to be up
 
04:56:31.430 --> 04:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
slightly in 26 and
 
04:56:35.230 --> 04:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
27 uh row two and four I mean 2 to four
 
04:56:38.470 --> 04:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
are the transfers to the other funds per
 
04:56:40.548 --> 04:56:40.558 align:start position:0%
the rsa's governing reeven Revenue
 
04:56:42.628 --> 04:56:42.638 align:start position:0%
transfers prior to our transfer to the
 
04:56:45.070 --> 04:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
general fund so there are two
 
04:56:48.230 --> 04:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
rsas um and their language is listed at
 
04:56:50.190 --> 04:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page the first transfer
 
04:56:51.830 --> 04:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
requirement is the
 
04:56:55.310 --> 04:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
17616 and that's the 5% of our prior
 
04:56:56.910 --> 04:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
year gross profit that needs to be
 
04:56:58.990 --> 04:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
transferred to the alcohol abuse and
 
04:56:59.000 --> 04:57:00.310 align:start position:0%
transferred to the alcohol abuse and
prevention

04:57:00.310 --> 04:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
04:57:05.708 --> 04:57:05.718 align:start position:0%
fund and then you have RSA 126 colon AA
 
04:57:07.868 --> 04:57:07.878 align:start position:0%
and that's the transfer to the granted
 
04:57:10.150 --> 04:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
Advantage healthc Care Program and it's
 
04:57:12.590 --> 04:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
it's also important to note that within
 
04:57:16.910 --> 04:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
this RSA um there's a provision that HHS
 
04:57:19.110 --> 04:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
can determine if there is a shortfall in
 
04:57:21.868 --> 04:57:21.878 align:start position:0%
the fund they can request request
 
04:57:23.390 --> 04:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
additional funds from the Liquor
 
04:57:25.788 --> 04:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
Commission to offset that shortfall so
 
04:57:27.670 --> 04:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
this year we've just received a letter
 
04:57:30.788 --> 04:57:30.798 align:start position:0%
that they're requesting initial 1.1 to2
 
04:57:33.510 --> 04:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
million is what they're anticipating
 
04:57:35.590 --> 04:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
which are not in the
 
04:57:38.910 --> 04:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
numbers um then you have on row five
 
04:57:40.990 --> 04:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
that's the actual transfer to the
 
04:57:43.990 --> 04:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
general fund after the transfers to HHS
 
04:57:46.390 --> 04:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
and then beer tax and you come to the
 
04:57:52.590 --> 04:57:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:55.750 --> 04:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
fund so on page 16 this is just a
 
04:57:57.510 --> 04:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
fiveyear history of the revenue and
 
04:57:59.030 --> 04:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
expenses and as you can see that there
 
04:58:01.430 --> 04:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
was a peak in Revenue uh during covid
 
04:58:03.270 --> 04:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
and we've had a decline in the Years
 
04:58:05.830 --> 04:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
following and then you'll also see that
 
04:58:09.590 --> 04:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
our expenses were pretty flat um prior
 
04:58:12.070 --> 04:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
to this this year where we had the large
 
04:58:16.670 --> 04:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:20.548 --> 04:58:20.558 align:start position:0%
expenses on slide 17 this is just our
 
04:58:22.470 --> 04:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue broken down into our three main
 
04:58:25.750 --> 04:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
category sources you have beer tax um
 
04:58:27.788 --> 04:58:27.798 align:start position:0%
liquor and wine revenue and then our
 
04:58:30.430 --> 04:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
other Revenue which includes licensing
 
04:58:32.548 --> 04:58:32.558 align:start position:0%
Lottery direct shipping permits and
 
04:58:36.548 --> 04:58:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:41.750 --> 04:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue oops miss a page
 
04:58:43.070 --> 04:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
on page
 
04:58:46.948 --> 04:58:46.958 align:start position:0%
18 this is a breakdown for FY 24 which
 
04:58:49.390 --> 04:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
is our sales by our customer types and
 
04:58:52.230 --> 04:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
buy spirits and wines in accessory
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
categories so retail sales are through
 
04:58:59.230 --> 04:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
our 65 retail outlets on- premise sales
 
04:59:01.910 --> 04:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
are sales for restaurants lounges um
 
04:59:04.510 --> 04:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
brew pubs and Social Clubs and then the
 
04:59:06.708 --> 04:59:06.718 align:start position:0%
off- premise are sales from convenient
 
04:59:10.670 --> 04:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
stores Grocery Stores um and then retail
 
04:59:13.270 --> 04:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
wine stores so you'll see that retail
 
04:59:16.350 --> 04:59:16.360 align:start position:0%
Spirits are 50% of our business retail
 
04:59:18.030 --> 04:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
wine is
 
04:59:21.110 --> 04:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
22% and that's a total for retail of
 
04:59:22.590 --> 04:59:22.600 align:start position:0%
about 7
 
04:59:25.150 --> 04:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
71.5% of our business and then you'll
 
04:59:27.628 --> 04:59:27.638 align:start position:0%
see on the pie charts the breakdown by
 
04:59:31.470 --> 04:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
the spirits and wine in each of those
 
04:59:34.350 --> 04:59:34.360 align:start position:0%
categories on the next slide um these
 
04:59:37.868 --> 04:59:37.878 align:start position:0%
are the top 15 outlets for 24 they were
 
04:59:41.868 --> 04:59:41.878 align:start position:0%
200 they made up 285 8 million with
 
04:59:44.310 --> 04:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
seven state-owned locations and they
 
04:59:51.110 --> 04:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:04.430 --> 05:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:08.270 --> 05:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
h on the gra on the um map
 
05:00:11.310 --> 05:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
yeah um don't think the numbers the
 
05:00:12.830 --> 05:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
locations are correct but I think the
 
05:00:17.070 --> 05:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:19.350 --> 05:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
updated I noticed that a little late in
 
05:00:21.548 --> 05:00:21.558 align:start position:0%
the game I wasn't able to finish
 
05:00:23.630 --> 05:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
it hoping nobody
 
05:00:23.640 --> 05:00:27.070 align:start position:0%
it hoping nobody
[Laughter]

05:00:27.070 --> 05:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:00:30.190 --> 05:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
noticed um so on slide
 
05:00:34.910 --> 05:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
20 um the agency uh sales there are
 
05:00:37.390 --> 05:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
three licensed uh agency stores that
 
05:00:39.990 --> 05:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
sell spirits and wines you have uh
 
05:00:41.590 --> 05:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
Greenville in the southern part of the
 
05:00:45.190 --> 05:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
state and that was established in 2003
 
05:00:46.830 --> 05:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
and then there are two licenses in the
 
05:00:48.628 --> 05:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
North Country Pittsburg which was
 
05:00:52.150 --> 05:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
established in 2005 but you'll also see
 
05:00:54.350 --> 05:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
that uh for arol there's a breakout of
 
05:00:56.430 --> 05:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
two locations and that's because the
 
05:00:58.510 --> 05:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
arrol General Store went out of business
 
05:01:02.310 --> 05:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
and LL Cody took over the new
 
05:01:04.470 --> 05:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
location and with that I'll turn it back
 
05:01:06.708 --> 05:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
to the chairman for marketing and
 
05:01:10.948 --> 05:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
Merchandising okay thanks Tina
 
05:01:14.030 --> 05:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
okay so on page 21 we'll look at the
 
05:01:17.030 --> 05:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
marketing and Merchandising uh page 22
 
05:01:19.190 --> 05:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
you'll see that we have 65 retail
 
05:01:21.190 --> 05:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
outlets warehouse and
 
05:01:24.910 --> 05:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
distribution uh warehouse space 240,000
 
05:01:29.190 --> 05:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
square feet the DHL Warehouse in Bow is
 
05:01:32.110 --> 05:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
a contracted Warehouse we have a 20-year
 
05:01:36.708 --> 05:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
contract with DHL and we are in our 11th
 
05:01:38.830 --> 05:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
year of that
 
05:01:42.628 --> 05:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
contract so the overview is that they do
 
05:01:45.670 --> 05:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
merchandising our they do our
 
05:01:48.910 --> 05:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
negotiation negotiating and purchasing
 
05:01:51.590 --> 05:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
and pricing for products and advertising
 
05:01:54.470 --> 05:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
is all part of uh the
 
05:01:54.480 --> 05:01:56.270 align:start position:0%
is all part of uh the
marketing

05:01:56.270 --> 05:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
marketing
 
05:01:59.110 --> 05:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
division retail outlets you can see that
 
05:02:02.670 --> 05:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
we have nine state owned about 141,000
 
05:02:06.670 --> 05:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
square fet and 59 least
 
05:02:11.350 --> 05:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
573 th000 Square ft and now 37 of those
 
05:02:15.470 --> 05:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
Outlets uh do curbside
 
05:02:18.510 --> 05:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
pickup our state-owned
 
05:02:23.830 --> 05:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh stores as of 2024 do about 21% of our
 
05:02:28.030 --> 05:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
business 156 million on slide
 
05:02:30.230 --> 05:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
24 on slide
 
05:02:35.310 --> 05:02:35.320 align:start position:0%
25 since 2012 we've updated and
 
05:02:38.310 --> 05:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
relocated uh 44 of our Outlets that
 
05:02:41.190 --> 05:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much over and done with
 
05:02:43.270 --> 05:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
there may be a few others along the way
 
05:02:45.788 --> 05:02:45.798 align:start position:0%
over the years but the majority of them
 
05:02:49.030 --> 05:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
have been done um recently we opened a
 
05:02:51.430 --> 05:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
new store in Derry and new outlets in
 
05:02:54.110 --> 05:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
Nash and
 
05:02:57.070 --> 05:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
Keen at this point we're finalizing the
 
05:02:59.910 --> 05:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment program of our properties
 
05:03:04.910 --> 05:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
on 95 North the RFP has gone out um
 
05:03:06.868 --> 05:03:06.878 align:start position:0%
we're waiting for the finalization of
 
05:03:09.070 --> 05:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
the purchase and sales agreement and the
 
05:03:11.190 --> 05:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
master develop vment agreement before we
 
05:03:13.788 --> 05:03:13.798 align:start position:0%
bring that selected bidder to governor
 
05:03:16.788 --> 05:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
and Council for
 
05:03:19.510 --> 05:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
approval on page 20 just some quick
 
05:03:22.110 --> 05:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
photos of these new outlets and the
 
05:03:25.510 --> 05:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
sales that they've done the Dairy Store
 
05:03:27.110 --> 05:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
the new nashaa
 
05:03:32.230 --> 05:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:34.750 --> 05:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
Swansea so marketing
 
05:03:37.628 --> 05:03:37.638 align:start position:0%
goals are to bring the best products and
 
05:03:40.190 --> 05:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
values to our customers obvious viously
 
05:03:42.590 --> 05:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
that's more important now than ever
 
05:03:46.788 --> 05:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
because of Total Wine having those 12
 
05:03:49.470 --> 05:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
stores in New England and again as I've
 
05:03:52.230 --> 05:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
said 50% of our business comes from
 
05:03:55.270 --> 05:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
crossborder sales so we have to be very
 
05:03:57.750 --> 05:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
sharp and Keen in our pricing and our
 
05:03:59.430 --> 05:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
discounting because a lot of that
 
05:04:03.590 --> 05:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
business comes from outside of our
 
05:04:07.430 --> 05:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
borders on page 30 you'll see that our
 
05:04:10.750 --> 05:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
website we have 125,000 th000 visitors a
 
05:04:13.670 --> 05:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
month and our in store pickup on the
 
05:04:16.990 --> 05:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
right hand side is about 3.2 million in
 
05:04:19.310 --> 05:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
sales with an increase of
 
05:04:24.230 --> 05:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
2.1% over 23 and 12.2 million year to
 
05:04:26.628 --> 05:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
date since the implementation of the
 
05:04:29.030 --> 05:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
curbside pickup so you can go on the
 
05:04:32.750 --> 05:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
website order your product pay for it
 
05:04:34.350 --> 05:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
and pick it up in the stores or we'll
 
05:04:36.510 --> 05:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
bring it out to your car and deliver it
 
05:04:39.030 --> 05:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
and one of the goals in the near future
 
05:04:41.708 --> 05:04:41.718 align:start position:0%
is home delivery of
 
05:04:45.190 --> 05:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
product on page 31 just some of the
 
05:04:48.150 --> 05:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
advertising and marketing we've done uh
 
05:04:50.868 --> 05:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
and we continue to do on a monthly basis
 
05:04:52.788 --> 05:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
a few displays in the
 
05:04:54.990 --> 05:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
stores and some of the things that we've
 
05:04:58.910 --> 05:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
added over the years on page 32 just an
 
05:05:02.948 --> 05:05:02.958 align:start position:0%
update on how we use our monthly sales
 
05:05:06.110 --> 05:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
to promote it via email inore Outlet
 
05:05:09.830 --> 05:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
digital advertising and social media and
 
05:05:12.030 --> 05:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
social media has become a huge part of
 
05:05:14.948 --> 05:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
our business as as it has with any
 
05:05:18.470 --> 05:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
retailer we have uh 10,000 over 10,000
 
05:05:22.430 --> 05:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
followers on Instagram we have 162,000
 
05:05:25.070 --> 05:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
plus followers on Facebook and we have
 
05:05:25.080 --> 05:05:26.230 align:start position:0%
plus followers on Facebook and we have
about

05:05:26.230 --> 05:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:05:30.548 --> 05:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
7300 followers on X we send out seven
 
05:05:33.948 --> 05:05:33.958 align:start position:0%
targeted emails a month to each email
 
05:05:36.868 --> 05:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
address that we have so we find a
 
05:05:40.310 --> 05:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
balance between bombarding people
 
05:05:43.430 --> 05:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
with emails and making sure that they're
 
05:05:45.310 --> 05:05:45.320 align:start position:0%
getting a look at the products that we
 
05:05:47.868 --> 05:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
have for sale and the great prices that
 
05:05:51.110 --> 05:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
we have and you can see that that's
 
05:05:54.190 --> 05:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
working because of the on page 34 you
 
05:05:57.270 --> 05:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
can see that 92% of our reviews Google
 
05:06:01.190 --> 05:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
reviews are uh either four or five star
 
05:06:04.230 --> 05:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
ratings that's important to us consumers
 
05:06:07.868 --> 05:06:07.878 align:start position:0%
are active on that platform and they

as the number one accreditation for law
 
05:09:39.708 --> 05:09:39.718 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies we are are a
 
05:09:42.430 --> 05:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
full-time sworn Juris a full
 
05:09:45.430 --> 05:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction law enforcement agency not
 
05:09:47.670 --> 05:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
under the purview of anybody else other
 
05:09:50.708 --> 05:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
than the Liquor Commission um and and
 
05:09:55.510 --> 05:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
with that in mind um we we are now the
 
05:09:57.470 --> 05:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
only state agency that is clear
 
05:09:59.510 --> 05:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
accredited and one of only 20 in the
 
05:10:02.788 --> 05:10:02.798 align:start position:0%
state so we we as you can tell I I spent
 
05:10:04.470 --> 05:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of time on that we're really proud
 
05:10:06.310 --> 05:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
of it it took us a long time to get
 
05:10:08.948 --> 05:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
there um and there are some agencies in
 
05:10:10.390 --> 05:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
this state state that just because of
 
05:10:11.910 --> 05:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
the way they structure just won't make
 
05:10:15.910 --> 05:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
it to that point um if you go to page 38
 
05:10:17.548 --> 05:10:17.558 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that the three prong
 
05:10:19.390 --> 05:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
approach for liquor enforcement
 
05:10:21.390 --> 05:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement licensing and
 
05:10:23.628 --> 05:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
education um enforcement like the
 
05:10:25.868 --> 05:10:25.878 align:start position:0%
chairman said earlier we look at the
 
05:10:29.350 --> 05:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
three- tier system um and we inspect and
 
05:10:31.628 --> 05:10:31.638 align:start position:0%
regulate that three- tier system
 
05:10:35.230 --> 05:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
accordingly um to add to that tobacco
 
05:10:38.070 --> 05:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
products um tobacco products is in our
 
05:10:42.190 --> 05:10:42.200 align:start position:0%
purview um we work very closely with Dr
 
05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
um in our relationships there to to uh
 
05:10:47.590 --> 05:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that that
 
05:10:50.548 --> 05:10:50.558 align:start position:0%
industry uh sells their products in a
 
05:10:55.390 --> 05:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
safe manner um licensing uh licensing
 
05:10:57.430 --> 05:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
we're really proud of because with that
 
05:10:59.230 --> 05:10:59.240 align:start position:0%
partnership that I spoke to about
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
earlier uh we're able to have open
 
05:11:03.788 --> 05:11:03.798 align:start position:0%
conversations providing guidance
 
05:11:06.628 --> 05:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
guidance to our lenses uh through the
 
05:11:09.470 --> 05:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
application lure procedure you will hear
 
05:11:11.708 --> 05:11:11.718 align:start position:0%

is in title 13 uh it's very neatly
 
05:14:04.868 --> 05:14:04.878 align:start position:0%
placed into that title so uh uh if we

05:14:23.150 --> 05:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
this gets confusing on premise are
 
05:14:26.190 --> 05:14:26.200 align:start position:0%
restaurants lounges brew pubs Social
 
05:14:28.948 --> 05:14:28.958 align:start position:0%

Tina to get get that number for you and
 
05:16:28.310 --> 05:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
I know that's very near and dear to your
 
05:16:30.750 --> 05:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
heart Mr chairman since uh you were the
 
05:16:34.190 --> 05:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor of that bill I'll just uh just
 
05:16:37.070 --> 05:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
speak briefly for the to the committee
 
05:16:39.548 --> 05:16:39.558 align:start position:0%
the uh there's 13 control states that
 
05:16:43.350 --> 05:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
are allow shipping of wine into their
 
05:16:45.788 --> 05:16:45.798 align:start position:0%
States from outside of the state of
 
05:16:47.910 --> 05:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
which we are one and there's eight
 
05:16:49.788 --> 05:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
states that allow the shipping of
 
05:16:52.628 --> 05:16:52.638 align:start position:0%
spirits into their state again which we
 
05:16:55.070 --> 05:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
are one and just to step back for a
 
05:16:57.948 --> 05:16:57.958 align:start position:0%
minute where the the chief talked about
 
05:17:00.830 --> 05:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh pilage and the word in the in the in
 
05:17:03.390 --> 05:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
the business we use is shrink our shrink
 
05:17:06.470 --> 05:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
is less than one half of 1% of our total
 
05:17:09.548 --> 05:17:09.558 align:start position:0%
sales pretty consistent year-over-year
 
05:17:12.548 --> 05:17:12.558 align:start position:0%
so the uh enforcement division does a
 
05:17:15.750 --> 05:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
great job with being in our stores uh
 
05:17:18.670 --> 05:17:18.680 align:start position:0%
you know being touching our
 
05:17:22.430 --> 05:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
customers guiding them they see they see
 
05:17:24.990 --> 05:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
the enforcement people in our stores and
 
05:17:28.590 --> 05:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
they also are a huge help to all of our
 
05:17:30.910 --> 05:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
uh employees in our stores to know that
 
05:17:33.470 --> 05:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
those folks are there and and kind of
 
05:17:36.750 --> 05:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
watching over them on a day-to-day basis
 
05:17:39.990 --> 05:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank thank you sir um very good point
 
05:17:42.390 --> 05:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that's Paramount to
 
05:17:44.670 --> 05:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
us and and near and dear to us also is
 
05:17:47.070 --> 05:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that our customers feel safe
 
05:17:49.548 --> 05:17:49.558 align:start position:0%
when they come into our stores and and
 
05:17:52.350 --> 05:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
that was one of the other prongs of of
 
05:17:54.868 --> 05:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
taking on the loss prevention and to
 
05:17:57.470 --> 05:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
have this law enforcement group in our
 
05:18:01.070 --> 05:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
stores uh very softly but handling
 
05:18:04.110 --> 05:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
things uh at negative instances when
 
05:18:07.070 --> 05:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
they happen if they happen uh we like to
 
05:18:10.190 --> 05:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
be proactive not reative active so it's
 
05:18:12.190 --> 05:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
it's worked out really well it's a good
 
05:18:15.910 --> 05:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
group um so if I can move to the next
 
05:18:18.390 --> 05:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
page uh which would be
 
05:18:22.510 --> 05:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
42 um education efforts so public aware
 
05:18:24.390 --> 05:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
I said earlier public awareness
 
05:18:27.590 --> 05:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
education is our foundation um if you
 
05:18:29.390 --> 05:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
don't know why you did something wrong
 
05:18:31.708 --> 05:18:31.718 align:start position:0%
you'll keep doing it wrong so we would
 
05:18:34.990 --> 05:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
like to partner up and and teach uh the
 
05:18:36.948 --> 05:18:36.958 align:start position:0%
right things and one of them that we
 
05:18:39.430 --> 05:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
teach is is our fatal choice
 
05:18:42.990 --> 05:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
efforts um our our our well not anymore
 
05:18:45.190 --> 05:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
our Millennial group right it's a it's a
 
05:18:47.708 --> 05:18:47.718 align:start position:0%
new group out there um our our
 
05:18:51.190 --> 05:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
vulnerable age group um are very smart
 
05:18:54.788 --> 05:18:54.798 align:start position:0%
in this in this state and and sometimes
 
05:18:56.910 --> 05:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
they need to touch the stove and we
 
05:18:58.868 --> 05:18:58.878 align:start position:0%
don't want to put them in cars and give
 
05:19:01.270 --> 05:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
them alcohol to find out what negatively
 
05:19:03.110 --> 05:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
can happen there right I mean it's not
 
05:19:06.110 --> 05:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
what we what we Proclaim but what we can
 
05:19:07.910 --> 05:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
do is put them into a control
 
05:19:11.548 --> 05:19:11.558 align:start position:0%
circumstance with a uh driving simulator
 
05:19:15.868 --> 05:19:15.878 align:start position:0%
or a golf cart that is uh chaperoned by
 
05:19:18.910 --> 05:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
an instructor with with dual
 
05:19:22.830 --> 05:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
controls um with our drunk goggles and
 
05:19:26.270 --> 05:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
we allow them to drive through the cone
 
05:19:30.070 --> 05:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
patterns uh to see how uh impairment
 
05:19:31.990 --> 05:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
does affect your operation of a motor
 
05:19:34.350 --> 05:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle we do it in uh a majority of our
 
05:19:37.948 --> 05:19:37.958 align:start position:0%
high schools um it sometimes we have
 
05:19:39.628 --> 05:19:39.638 align:start position:0%
problems with scheduling because we're
 
05:19:42.948 --> 05:19:42.958 align:start position:0%
asked to do it so often uh but it's the
 
05:19:44.830 --> 05:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get into our high schools
 
05:19:47.270 --> 05:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
and talk to our vulnerable age group is
 
05:19:50.670 --> 05:19:50.680 align:start position:0%
just one of the most satisfying things
 
05:19:53.990 --> 05:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
that I do as a director of the agency so
 
05:19:56.910 --> 05:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
or the division so um our mobile
 
05:20:00.190 --> 05:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
Outreach unit which is funded by navka
 
05:20:03.910 --> 05:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
um also has a driving simulator in it um
 
05:20:06.470 --> 05:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
we take it on the road with us I hate to
 
05:20:08.708 --> 05:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
equate it to the bookmobile but it's
 
05:20:11.830 --> 05:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
like a bookmobile um it goes out to our
 
05:20:13.670 --> 05:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
J our
 
05:20:18.590 --> 05:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities um to to do uh PR events
 
05:20:22.110 --> 05:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
uh and talk to kids and adults about uh
 
05:20:24.830 --> 05:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
the negative effects of alcohol uh I
 
05:20:26.948 --> 05:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
thought it was a booking mobile because
 
05:20:28.670 --> 05:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
you can book somebody you can book
 
05:20:30.110 --> 05:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
somebody right don't you have you used
 
05:20:33.788 --> 05:20:33.798 align:start position:0%
to you used to be it it used to be
 
05:20:36.270 --> 05:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
historically it used to be the
 
05:20:40.910 --> 05:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
DWI uh Command Post um we don't uh run
 
05:20:42.910 --> 05:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
it that way anymore is it the same
 
05:20:44.548 --> 05:20:44.558 align:start position:0%
vehicle cuz I don't remember it the same
 
05:20:47.230 --> 05:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
it's the canopy on on the other well it
 
05:20:50.470 --> 05:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
was closed um it is the same vehicle we
 
05:20:53.750 --> 05:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
rebranded it we put new decaling on it
 
05:20:55.750 --> 05:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
and we put the driving simulator inside
 
05:20:57.030 --> 05:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
of it
 
05:20:59.628 --> 05:20:59.638 align:start position:0%
cool uh continuing with our uh
 
05:21:01.910 --> 05:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
educational efforts uh we have buyers
 
05:21:04.390 --> 05:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
beware it's a campaign that actually is
 
05:21:07.750 --> 05:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
on the table right now to uh spruce up a
 
05:21:09.628 --> 05:21:09.638 align:start position:0%
little bit but it talks about the
 
05:21:11.948 --> 05:21:11.958 align:start position:0%
dangers and consequences of providing
 
05:21:15.430 --> 05:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol to miners um alcohol awareness
 
05:21:18.430 --> 05:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
posters are what we do in our uh grammar
 
05:21:21.670 --> 05:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
schools um again participating schools
 
05:21:23.430 --> 05:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
provide we're providing the opportunity
 
05:21:26.430 --> 05:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
to their students to turn around peer
 
05:21:29.230 --> 05:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
pressures and uh send a message a
 
05:21:31.750 --> 05:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
positive message to their friends uh
 
05:21:33.708 --> 05:21:33.718 align:start position:0%
that alcohol doesn't have to be a part
 
05:21:36.070 --> 05:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
of their lives in the vulnerable age
 
05:21:39.070 --> 05:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
group um presentations
 
05:21:41.150 --> 05:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
um sometimes you'll see me running in
 
05:21:43.788 --> 05:21:43.798 align:start position:0%
here a little late um it's because I'm
 
05:21:45.430 --> 05:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
usually at a high school doing a
 
05:21:47.590 --> 05:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
presentation we do a lot of those on a
 
05:21:50.510 --> 05:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
yearly basis um again they're really fun
 
05:21:52.390 --> 05:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
to do and it's really good to get our
 
05:21:54.190 --> 05:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
ear close to the ground to listen to the
 
05:21:56.430 --> 05:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
trends that are going on both negative
 
05:21:59.948 --> 05:21:59.958 align:start position:0%
and positive um every couple weeks uh
 
05:22:02.150 --> 05:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
some of you have heard me uh I do a
 
05:22:04.470 --> 05:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
radio show with Jack Heath down here at
 
05:22:07.190 --> 05:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
Benny um and we talk about our education
 
05:22:09.750 --> 05:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
efforts uh that that radio show allows
 
05:22:14.470 --> 05:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
us to hit uh approximately 95 uh,
 
05:22:18.310 --> 05:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
listeners at one glimpse so again it's
 
05:22:20.150 --> 05:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
another support mechanism to get our
 
05:22:23.350 --> 05:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
message out there um to to all the
 
05:22:25.910 --> 05:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
people not only in the 603 but in the
 
05:22:25.920 --> 05:22:27.548 align:start position:0%
people not only in the 603 but in the
tri-state

05:22:27.548 --> 05:22:27.558 align:start position:0%
tri-state
 
05:22:32.190 --> 05:22:32.200 align:start position:0%

05:28:46.230 --> 05:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
looks like we have some question some
 
05:28:53.868 --> 05:28:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:56.350 --> 05:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
committee here's my question it's kind
 
05:28:59.788 --> 05:28:59.798 align:start position:0%
of you have an interesting uh uh
 
05:29:01.750 --> 05:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
complicated thing here because you're a
 
05:29:04.390 --> 05:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
big part of the budget and um it's
 
05:29:06.430 --> 05:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
important to the state of New Hampshire
 
05:29:08.670 --> 05:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
yet there's all this you know as you
 
05:29:10.350 --> 05:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's these all these
 
05:29:13.110 --> 05:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
research coming out again about alcohol
 
05:29:15.868 --> 05:29:15.878 align:start position:0%
and we already know about tobacco so
 
05:29:18.548 --> 05:29:18.558 align:start position:0%
where where do you see the agency you
 
05:29:21.070 --> 05:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
know going forward in 10 years I mean
 
05:29:23.350 --> 05:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
you know um it's kind of a dilemma I
 
05:29:25.430 --> 05:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
mean should we have wet should we have
 
05:29:28.350 --> 05:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
wet januaries to encourage drinking or
 
05:29:32.350 --> 05:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
where do we go well we're in we're
 
05:29:34.310 --> 05:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative we're in the the business
 
05:29:38.670 --> 05:29:38.680 align:start position:0%
of uh providing protecting
 
05:29:41.110 --> 05:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
the business itself we're not a public
 
05:29:44.310 --> 05:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
health agency so uh much like our stand
 
05:29:48.390 --> 05:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
on cannabis uh and we don't we don't
 
05:29:49.910 --> 05:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
take a stand on where the Liquor
 
05:29:52.070 --> 05:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
Commission will be in 10 years we know
 
05:29:55.230 --> 05:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
that it's been a profitable agency since
 
05:29:57.750 --> 05:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
1934 and we hope that it continues to
 
05:30:00.270 --> 05:30:00.280 align:start position:0%
stay that way for many reasons not only
 
05:30:02.708 --> 05:30:02.718 align:start position:0%
from The Profit standpoint but for the
 
05:30:04.990 --> 05:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of Public Safety for
 
05:30:08.070 --> 05:30:08.080 align:start position:0%

thank you represent
 
05:30:13.470 --> 05:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
wals thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:30:15.830 --> 05:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question I don't expect you to
 
05:30:17.990 --> 05:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
have the answer although you might have
 
05:30:19.910 --> 05:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
it but if you could get back to me I'd
 
05:30:23.990 --> 05:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate it turning to page 26
 
05:30:26.510 --> 05:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
specifically uh being in a town I'm
 
05:30:28.910 --> 05:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
speaking for my constituents where you
 
05:30:32.830 --> 05:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
removed a liquor store and we are all
 
05:30:36.310 --> 05:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
still very upset about it uh I would
 
05:30:39.430 --> 05:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
like to know uh what did our sales uh
 
05:30:42.230 --> 05:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
compared to the sales of this facility
 
05:30:44.150 --> 05:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
which is 2 miles down the road from
 
05:30:46.548 --> 05:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
another state liquor store so it seems
 
05:30:49.070 --> 05:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
kind of odd that you would move one that
 
05:30:51.470 --> 05:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
was in a different town that served a
 
05:30:55.030 --> 05:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
different group to a town that already
 
05:30:57.868 --> 05:30:57.878 align:start position:0%
had another store literally less than
 
05:30:59.390 --> 05:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
two because I've measured
 
05:31:02.670 --> 05:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
it not that I'm I'm upset over this or
 
05:31:02.680 --> 05:31:04.910 align:start position:0%
it not that I'm I'm upset over this or
anything

05:31:04.910 --> 05:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
anything
 
05:31:07.548 --> 05:31:07.558 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure we I'm sure we've measured
 
05:31:10.670 --> 05:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
it as as well yeah respectfully uh I'm
 
05:31:12.310 --> 05:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
not sure which store that you're talking
 
05:31:15.270 --> 05:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
Hamstead Hamstead Route 111 okay we'll
 
05:31:16.670 --> 05:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
be happy to take a look at what the
 
05:31:18.910 --> 05:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
numbers were yeah and get back to this
 
05:31:21.750 --> 05:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
store that you you opened it used to be
 
05:31:25.270 --> 05:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
um uh what was it Sabers or or something
 
05:31:28.310 --> 05:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
like that whatever it was um it's just
 
05:31:30.948 --> 05:31:30.958 align:start position:0%
down the the same road it's a straight
 
05:31:34.470 --> 05:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
line to the store at the exit 5 to the
 
05:31:37.910 --> 05:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
new Dairy Store yeah okay no this store
 
05:31:41.788 --> 05:31:41.798 align:start position:0%
that you moved in Dairy is 2 miles down
 
05:31:44.548 --> 05:31:44.558 align:start position:0%
the straight line to another state
 
05:31:47.430 --> 05:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
liquor store at Exit 5 which I think is
 
05:31:50.150 --> 05:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
actually lenon okay all right but it's
 
05:31:52.070 --> 05:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
still 2 miles away from another Sate
 
05:31:54.310 --> 05:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
liquor store where his eyes wasn't my
 
05:31:56.548 --> 05:31:56.558 align:start position:0%
betting my bet in just looking at it
 
05:31:58.470 --> 05:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
I'll get you the actual numbers of all
 
05:32:01.390 --> 05:32:01.400 align:start position:0%
those but I would say the traffic count
 
05:32:04.230 --> 05:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
probably has a lot to do with what we
 
05:32:07.430 --> 05:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
the reason and and the the biggest thing
 
05:32:09.750 --> 05:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
that we do is obviously we want to be
 
05:32:12.150 --> 05:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
with like-minded retailers so we want to
 
05:32:14.868 --> 05:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
be where people are shopping and and
 
05:32:17.470 --> 05:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
there there's retailers around us some
 
05:32:20.628 --> 05:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
of the locations that we've closed are
 
05:32:23.868 --> 05:32:23.878 align:start position:0%
because there is not a lot of retail in
 
05:32:26.150 --> 05:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
specific areas where the stores used to
 
05:32:28.948 --> 05:32:28.958 align:start position:0%
be uh we had a lot of stores that were
 
05:32:31.868 --> 05:32:31.878 align:start position:0%
we we had 82 stores when I started at
 
05:32:33.990 --> 05:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission we have this we
 
05:32:37.430 --> 05:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
have the 60 plus now but the important
 
05:32:40.628 --> 05:32:40.638 align:start position:0%
thing to note is that we have
 
05:32:44.590 --> 05:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
357,000 more square feet in less stores
 
05:32:47.070 --> 05:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
than we had originally so oh I'm sure
 
05:32:49.350 --> 05:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
you you did the research and it made
 
05:32:51.470 --> 05:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
sense you know but I would be interested
 
05:32:53.830 --> 05:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
because it's still a topic of
 
05:32:56.390 --> 05:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
conversation on the on the
 
05:32:59.350 --> 05:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
two shop enough well it's still on the
 
05:33:02.708 --> 05:33:02.718 align:start position:0%
two Hamstead U you know Community Pages
 
05:33:06.548 --> 05:33:06.558 align:start position:0%
how upset people are that it left so
 
05:33:09.070 --> 05:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
that I'm asking for my constituents I'm
 
05:33:10.750 --> 05:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about them you want to be
 
05:33:14.110 --> 05:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
able to I I participated I all I can say
 
05:33:16.590 --> 05:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
is is there a Market Basket or you know
 
05:33:19.110 --> 05:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
next is right yes if there's a hanford's
 
05:33:23.628 --> 05:33:23.638 align:start position:0%
that is like uh 1 half mile away and a
 
05:33:23.638 --> 05:33:24.708 align:start position:0%
that is like uh 1 half mile away and a
uh

05:33:24.708 --> 05:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:33:27.548 --> 05:33:27.558 align:start position:0%
Walgreens and so there are other retails
 
05:33:30.548 --> 05:33:30.558 align:start position:0%
but there's no other liquor store other
 
05:33:34.788 --> 05:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
than that and da Salem or plasto I would
 
05:33:37.150 --> 05:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
say that I have to drive more than five
 
05:33:40.548 --> 05:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
miles to get to our brand new liquor
 
05:33:40.558 --> 05:33:45.548 align:start position:0%
miles to get to our brand new liquor
store

05:33:45.548 --> 05:33:45.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:48.110 --> 05:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
congratulations hi uh thanks for taking
 
05:33:50.708 --> 05:33:50.718 align:start position:0%
my question uh I just would like to know
 
05:33:53.390 --> 05:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about statistics on
 
05:33:56.230 --> 05:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
what are the percentage of the underage
 
05:33:59.430 --> 05:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
drinking in last 3 four years whether it
 
05:34:03.190 --> 05:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
has gone up or down and what we are
 
05:34:06.470 --> 05:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
doing if it is going up so thank you for
 
05:34:09.190 --> 05:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
your question representative and hello
 
05:34:13.510 --> 05:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
hi um so underage drinking has actually
 
05:34:17.070 --> 05:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
nationally trended down um which is a
 
05:34:19.310 --> 05:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
great statistic but it doesn't mean that
 
05:34:22.788 --> 05:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
we let our guard down with that um are
 
05:34:25.030 --> 05:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
we right now and I talked about that
 
05:34:29.830 --> 05:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
robust uh Foundation that we have those
 
05:34:33.830 --> 05:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
on a yearly basis we are doing more and
 
05:34:37.868 --> 05:34:37.878 align:start position:0%
more in our high schools um it's it just
 
05:34:39.628 --> 05:34:39.638 align:start position:0%
took a little while to get the message
 
05:34:42.990 --> 05:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
out um and it took us a little while to
 
05:34:46.470 --> 05:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
to spruce up our training that we've had
 
05:34:49.310 --> 05:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
for years um and some of it we needed to
 
05:34:52.830 --> 05:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
be a little bit more creative with so um
 
05:34:54.628 --> 05:34:54.638 align:start position:0%
we feel we're at that point we're still
 
05:34:57.750 --> 05:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
looking for creative ideas to to move to
 
05:35:01.750 --> 05:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
the next level but uh but we uh and I
 
05:35:05.350 --> 05:35:05.360 align:start position:0%

05:35:27.750 --> 05:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
up so I'm from nashwa and uh we have
 
05:35:29.628 --> 05:35:29.638 align:start position:0%
three now from Nash so yeah that's
 
05:35:31.110 --> 05:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
that's the question I had that you know
 
05:35:33.030 --> 05:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh actually there are two outlets in
 
05:35:35.708 --> 05:35:35.718 align:start position:0%
nashwa I know one exit six and one exit
 
05:35:39.190 --> 05:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
one that's a lot of crossb uh consumers
 
05:35:41.470 --> 05:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned you mentioned that
 
05:35:44.070 --> 05:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
there is another Outlet relocated is
 
05:35:45.750 --> 05:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
that a third one in nashwa or is it
 
05:35:47.788 --> 05:35:47.798 align:start position:0%
something relocated from nashar to
 
05:35:47.798 --> 05:35:54.868 align:start position:0%
something relocated from nashar to
nashar

05:35:54.868 --> 05:35:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:57.470 --> 05:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
itself there only two right now but I
 
05:36:01.788 --> 05:36:01.798 align:start position:0%
see here on page 37 27 nasva Outlet 32
 
05:36:03.708 --> 05:36:03.718 align:start position:0%
relocated so did you relocate the
 
05:36:05.230 --> 05:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
existing one from somewhere to somewhere
 
05:36:07.708 --> 05:36:07.718 align:start position:0%
yeah it was in the same Plaza we just re
 
05:36:10.430 --> 05:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
located to a we relocated to a
 
05:36:13.030 --> 05:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
freestanding location in that in that
 
05:36:16.110 --> 05:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
store so we have Coliseum a we have the
 
05:36:18.868 --> 05:36:18.878 align:start position:0%
one at the Rockingham Mall we and no I'm
 
05:36:20.548 --> 05:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
talking about nashwa in Nashville you
 
05:36:24.070 --> 05:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
have one in exit one near the uh fitland
 
05:36:27.390 --> 05:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
mall and one in exit six it used to be
 
05:36:29.990 --> 05:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
exit 6 yeah so yeah but they moved
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
there's one over by the by the one but
 
05:36:35.150 --> 05:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
the col was I mean the co
 
05:36:37.310 --> 05:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
say so there are two so what is this
 
05:36:39.910 --> 05:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
really located is that a new one or is
 
05:36:42.670 --> 05:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
something existing one from nashar to
 
05:36:44.708 --> 05:36:44.718 align:start position:0%
nashwa but
 
05:36:48.110 --> 05:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
second there's three
 
05:36:51.110 --> 05:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
polium the one in the at the mall and
 
05:36:52.510 --> 05:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
the one that you're speaking of there's
 
05:36:55.030 --> 05:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
three stores so three stores correct
 
05:36:57.110 --> 05:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
okay I the third one
 
05:37:00.510 --> 05:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
but so that store that was opened was in
 
05:37:04.190 --> 05:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
the back of a mall much smaller and we
 
05:37:07.070 --> 05:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
moved it out when uh a Pier One Import
 
05:37:09.110 --> 05:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
went out of of business we moved that
 
05:37:10.990 --> 05:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
store out to the front perer One Imports
 
05:37:12.510 --> 05:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's the one yeah it was a Pier
 
05:37:14.430 --> 05:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
One Imports and we moved it out to the
 
05:37:16.670 --> 05:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
front right on the highway right out
 
05:37:18.830 --> 05:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
front that store used to be in the back
 
05:37:21.110 --> 05:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
of that Plaza it was high so the exit
 
05:37:24.070 --> 05:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
one same it just mov okay no no and the
 
05:37:25.830 --> 05:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
second okay all right second question
 
05:37:28.070 --> 05:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
was uh you did mention in your
 
05:37:29.990 --> 05:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
presentation that uh half of your
 
05:37:32.310 --> 05:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
business comes from crossborder
 
05:37:34.470 --> 05:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
consumers so does it mean that New
 
05:37:36.470 --> 05:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is doing much better than uh
 
05:37:37.868 --> 05:37:37.878 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and other States
 
05:37:40.310 --> 05:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
surrounding states in terms of uh liquor
 
05:37:42.070 --> 05:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
sale or what's the reason that you're
 
05:37:44.230 --> 05:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
getting half of their business because
 
05:37:45.310 --> 05:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
they also have their own business as
 
05:37:47.990 --> 05:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
well right they do and they have uh
 
05:37:50.628 --> 05:37:50.638 align:start position:0%
Total Wine is there obviously who is our
 
05:37:52.868 --> 05:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
our biggest competition thus the
 
05:37:54.708 --> 05:37:54.718 align:start position:0%
additional discounting that we've had to
 
05:37:57.548 --> 05:37:57.558 align:start position:0%
do in the past few years
 
05:38:00.310 --> 05:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
so traditionally New Hampshire has been
 
05:38:02.270 --> 05:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
one of those places that people come to
 
05:38:04.390 --> 05:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
and Shop they have second homes they
 
05:38:06.868 --> 05:38:06.878 align:start position:0%
come to ski they come to snowmobile
 
05:38:09.390 --> 05:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
Recreation in the summertime so a lot of
 
05:38:11.670 --> 05:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
that business comes through and that's
 
05:38:13.628 --> 05:38:13.638 align:start position:0%
where a lot of that traffic comes from
 
05:38:17.350 --> 05:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
no sales tax uh no sales tax they they
 
05:38:19.868 --> 05:38:19.878 align:start position:0%
actually repealed their tax on alcohol a
 
05:38:22.390 --> 05:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
few years back okay when Governor Duval
 
05:38:24.788 --> 05:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
was in place because he recognized I
 
05:38:27.270 --> 05:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
believe it was 8% at the time that the
 
05:38:30.830 --> 05:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
tax was uh encroaching on their sales
 
05:38:32.708 --> 05:38:32.718 align:start position:0%
and that's another thing that brought
 
05:38:36.548 --> 05:38:36.558 align:start position:0%
Total Wine to Massachusetts so thank you
 
05:38:38.788 --> 05:38:38.798 align:start position:0%
you're welcome I mean in the old days
 
05:38:40.430 --> 05:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
that Massachusetts was just a lot of
 
05:38:43.948 --> 05:38:43.958 align:start position:0%
little packies not small small stores
 
05:38:46.628 --> 05:38:46.638 align:start position:0%
and then and then once they opened it up
 
05:38:47.708 --> 05:38:47.718 align:start position:0%
which everyone thought it was going to
 
05:38:49.708 --> 05:38:49.718 align:start position:0%
be the grocery stores that were going to
 
05:38:53.910 --> 05:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
take advantage of that um Lo behold it
 
05:38:57.430 --> 05:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
was Total Wines represent question thank
 
05:39:00.110 --> 05:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I just have a question I
 
05:39:01.390 --> 05:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
didn't I didn't see it mentioned in your
 
05:39:04.110 --> 05:39:04.120 align:start position:0%
packet uh mainly from my own curiosity
 
05:39:07.670 --> 05:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
you have a program for limited release
 
05:39:10.670 --> 05:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh mainly Spirits I think and uh if you
 
05:39:11.670 --> 05:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
could just explain I think it's a
 
05:39:14.030 --> 05:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
lottery based system if you just explain
 
05:39:15.868 --> 05:39:15.878 align:start position:0%
how that works and and uh how much
 
05:39:18.150 --> 05:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
revenue maybe comes in from that and and
 
05:39:20.230 --> 05:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
what's the secret to getting you know
 
05:39:21.948 --> 05:39:21.958 align:start position:0%
the winning lottery get get on the
 
05:39:25.230 --> 05:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
mailing list get on sign signing up for
 
05:39:27.310 --> 05:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
the mailing list is the is the original
 
05:39:29.750 --> 05:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
piece that gets you into the lottery we
 
05:39:32.868 --> 05:39:32.878 align:start position:0%
do two lotteries a year now two for
 
05:39:36.230 --> 05:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
general public and I can I can get you
 
05:39:38.030 --> 05:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
the actual numbers but but it's pretty
 
05:39:40.150 --> 05:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
staggering as to the amount of alcohol
 
05:39:44.430 --> 05:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
that's brought through uh those uh items
 
05:39:46.948 --> 05:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
come to us every year on an allocated
 
05:39:49.708 --> 05:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
basis so rather than put them out in the
 
05:39:52.070 --> 05:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
stores and have some consumers get them
 
05:39:55.590 --> 05:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
and some consumers not as well as
 
05:39:59.390 --> 05:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
lies we've we designed two a year so two
 
05:40:03.110 --> 05:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
for lenses and two for private consumers
 
05:40:05.390 --> 05:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
and you put your name in and I think
 
05:40:07.868 --> 05:40:07.878 align:start position:0%
this year we gave away
 
05:40:11.468 --> 05:40:11.478 align:start position:0%
366,000 bottles in one and 16,000
 
05:40:13.350 --> 05:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
bottles in another I'll get you the
 
05:40:17.070 --> 05:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
actual sales numbers and but it's been
 
05:40:19.590 --> 05:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
we've had the most positive feedback
 
05:40:21.670 --> 05:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
from our consumers since we started
 
05:40:24.110 --> 05:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
doing this because a lot of consumers
 
05:40:27.468 --> 05:40:27.478 align:start position:0%
don't have time to troll our stores or
 
05:40:29.468 --> 05:40:29.478 align:start position:0%
our website which is really the way
 
05:40:31.990 --> 05:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
people do it they troll the website for
 
05:40:33.948 --> 05:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
those allocated products they go in and
 
05:40:36.110 --> 05:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
buy them all and then quite frankly
 
05:40:38.390 --> 05:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
they'd resell them and that was people
 
05:40:40.670 --> 05:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
were you know people are making money in
 
05:40:42.788 --> 05:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
the in the black market all over the
 
05:40:45.750 --> 05:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
country on those allocated items Weller
 
05:40:49.230 --> 05:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
papy van winko Buffalo Trace Etc so we
 
05:40:51.590 --> 05:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
found that this is the fairest way to do
 
05:40:53.548 --> 05:40:53.558 align:start position:0%
it and I'll get you those numbers
 
05:40:57.390 --> 05:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
represented y question okay oh another
 
05:40:59.030 --> 05:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
question yes representative spear
 
05:41:01.708 --> 05:41:01.718 align:start position:0%
another representative from
 
05:41:04.430 --> 05:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
Nash my question has nothing to do with
 
05:41:06.670 --> 05:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
Nash one of the things that we talked
 
05:41:11.468 --> 05:41:11.478 align:start position:0%
about last year was some kind of uh uh I
 
05:41:13.628 --> 05:41:13.638 align:start position:0%
guess a video we decided on or you
 
05:41:15.708 --> 05:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
decided on and presented us with a video
 
05:41:20.110 --> 05:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
about uh don't over drink you know that
 
05:41:22.510 --> 05:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
that there are problems with people
 
05:41:24.230 --> 05:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
overdrinking I'm wondering if you're
 
05:41:26.070 --> 05:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
going to be expanding on that program
 
05:41:28.190 --> 05:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
and we have a lot of talk about not
 
05:41:30.070 --> 05:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
getting alcohol near youngsters and
 
05:41:33.230 --> 05:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
that's can't do too much for that sure
 
05:41:35.070 --> 05:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
but what about people overdrinking who
 
05:41:38.270 --> 05:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
are overage
 
05:41:41.390 --> 05:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
well I mean you're supposed to know
 
05:41:44.150 --> 05:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
better we does everything have to be a
 
05:41:46.590 --> 05:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
bill I mean did we have a bill for
 
05:41:49.310 --> 05:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
Education no that was that was um the
 
05:41:52.350 --> 05:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
beer distributors had a video about why
 
05:41:54.628 --> 05:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
we have the three tier
 
05:41:57.270 --> 05:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
system well that's what the video was
 
05:42:00.990 --> 05:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
about okay we I'm not even sure I like
 
05:42:04.750 --> 05:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
the 3D system but that's me that's for
 
05:42:06.910 --> 05:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
another story yes okay but I mean just
 
05:42:09.350 --> 05:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
so kind of an educational thing that's a
 
05:42:11.948 --> 05:42:11.958 align:start position:0%
little more than just one video that we
 
05:42:13.430 --> 05:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
had I mean I thought that was a good
 
05:42:16.110 --> 05:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
start but I kind of thought
 
05:42:19.190 --> 05:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
maybe I mean we have so many DUIs and so
 
05:42:21.708 --> 05:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
many other accidents and everything else
 
05:42:23.310 --> 05:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
and it's it's not all just by young
 
05:42:25.270 --> 05:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
people I mean I see that they announce
 
05:42:27.110 --> 05:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
it in the paper every
 
05:42:29.310 --> 05:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
week have you thinking about any of
 
05:42:31.590 --> 05:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
those kind of things well it one of the
 
05:42:33.868 --> 05:42:33.878 align:start position:0%
things I can get you the actual numbers
 
05:42:36.110 --> 05:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
on on how many times that video has been
 
05:42:38.030 --> 05:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
played and what story it's been played
 
05:42:41.468 --> 05:42:41.478 align:start position:0%
in it's uh we actually we've done a
 
05:42:44.590 --> 05:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
couple of legislatures have uh have
 
05:42:46.350 --> 05:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
requested that and we've sent it out to
 
05:42:49.430 --> 05:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
them and we're happy to do that you know
 
05:42:51.948 --> 05:42:51.958 align:start position:0%
any ideas that you have uh you know
 
05:42:53.390 --> 05:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
anything so you're you're referring to
 
05:42:55.230 --> 05:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
the video that's now running in the
 
05:42:57.990 --> 05:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
stores the 211 video that we designed
 
05:43:00.948 --> 05:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
last year was an answer to that
 
05:43:02.990 --> 05:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
legislated tourist okay so I stand
 
05:43:04.468 --> 05:43:04.478 align:start position:0%
corrected it's not the beer distributor
 
05:43:06.708 --> 05:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
one this is the one that the you can now
 
05:43:09.548 --> 05:43:09.558 align:start position:0%
see in not all the stores have the big
 
05:43:12.990 --> 05:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
screen TVs but
 
05:43:16.110 --> 05:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
they a lot of alcohol adti it's on a
 
05:43:18.350 --> 05:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
seven minute Loop so every seven minutes
 
05:43:21.548 --> 05:43:21.558 align:start position:0%
in one of those stores that that's being
 
05:43:24.948 --> 05:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
played so I we actually I think he has
 
05:43:27.190 --> 05:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
another bill in again this year so stay
 
05:43:29.468 --> 05:43:29.478 align:start position:0%
tuned yeah we have the number of
 
05:43:31.270 --> 05:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
Impressions and how many times that's
 
05:43:34.788 --> 05:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
been played I'll get that to you yeah
 
05:43:36.468 --> 05:43:36.478 align:start position:0%
but you want to see something aimed at I
 
05:43:37.948 --> 05:43:37.958 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm I'm thinking maybe we
 
05:43:37.958 --> 05:43:39.030 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm I'm thinking maybe we
need

05:43:39.030 --> 05:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
need
 
05:43:41.670 --> 05:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
something I really appreciated how much
 
05:43:45.670 --> 05:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
effort was put into the young people
 
05:43:47.868 --> 05:43:47.878 align:start position:0%
effort but with all the DUIs and
 
05:43:49.310 --> 05:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
everything else that we have shouldn't
 
05:43:52.350 --> 05:43:52.360 align:start position:0%
we be spending some effort
 
05:43:55.430 --> 05:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
on older people
 
05:43:58.708 --> 05:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
effort right that that's what the video
 
05:44:01.190 --> 05:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
is for but obviously it's not totally we
 
05:44:04.708 --> 05:44:04.718 align:start position:0%
can we can discuss this offline so thank
 
05:44:07.350 --> 05:44:07.360 align:start position:0%

05:57:46.390 --> 05:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
hearings on next Tuesday but that's
 
05:57:47.788 --> 05:57:47.798 align:start position:0%
based on whether I can get a committee
 
05:57:50.628 --> 05:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
room otherwise it would be Wednesday um
 
05:57:52.670 --> 05:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
we only have six bills in committee at
 
05:57:55.070 --> 05:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
this moment so who knows what we'll have
 
05:57:56.788 --> 05:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning when I'll be allowed to
 
05:58:00.830 --> 05:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
schedule bills so otherwise we'll try to
 
05:58:05.110 --> 05:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
