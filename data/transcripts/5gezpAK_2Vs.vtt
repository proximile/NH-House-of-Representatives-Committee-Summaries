dollar donations that's a lot of door
 
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
knocking that's a lot of talking to your
 
00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 align:start position:0%
neighbors talking to people in your
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
districts a lot of the retail politics
 
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
that people in the New Hampshire House
 
00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 align:start position:0%
of Representatives understand how to do
 
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
after qualifying
 
00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
candidates can accept camera you know
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
ask for can can invite voters to give
 
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
them the 25 certificates to finance
 
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
their campaign and they can continue to
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
raise small donations of between five
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
dollars and 20 125 for executive Council
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
five and 250 for governor
 
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
the candidates who win their primaries
 
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
enough to let them run a viable general
 
00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 align:start position:0%
election campaign
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial candidates win the primary
 
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
get a million dollars executive cancel
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
Council candidates will get sixty
 
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so they could turn
 
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
around pivot after the primary and run
 
00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
and run a viable
 
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
general election campaign
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's the plan that's what this bill
 
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.270 align:start position:0%
that's the plan that's what this bill
does

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
it's something different it's something
 
00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
new it's
 
00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:40.010 align:start position:0%
new it's
um

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
it's an idea
 
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
and it's a plan that's meant to address
 
00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
a campaign Finance system that a whole
 
00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
lot of people think is broken
 
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
a campaign Finance system that forces
 
00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
candidates to genuflect to big donors
 
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
a campaign Finance system that gives
 
00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
Elites and especially out-of-state
 
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
Elites too much power over who runs
 
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
over who gets nominated and over who
 
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
wins and I might just note that that
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
those qualifying small donations that I
 
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned the the the donations of say
 
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
five dollars that you have to get to to
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
qualify to receive voter dollars ninety
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
percent of those small donations have to
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
come from in-state voters in order to
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
qualify gotta call those don't small
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
donations have to come from New
 
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rights
 
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
in order to qualify to receive voter
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
dollars so this disempowers the the
 
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
Elites in the state of California who
 
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
who have a an awfully large appetite to
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
influence how things go in a state like
 
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they lose their power
 
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire voters
 
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
I worry that
 
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
ordinary citizens without connections to
 
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
the donor class
 
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:00.300 align:start position:0%
lose hope that they can run a viable
 
00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
campaign for the higher offices in the
 
00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
state they they fill the New Hampshire
 
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives and they serve
 
00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
I'm I dare say with great distinction
 
00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
in both parties in the New Hampshire
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives we know that an
 
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
amateur legislature works we know that
 
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
citizen legislators and citizen
 
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
officials bring real wisdom to public
 
00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:26.099 align:start position:0%
decision making and and that's the
 
00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
spirit I'd like to I'd like to open that
 
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
door the door that is open in the New
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house to the higher offices in
 
00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
right now as I mentioned
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
people know that they can't really run
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
for those higher offices
 
00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:44.930 align:start position:0%
for those higher offices
without

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
without taking on almost a full-time job
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
of begging out of Staters for money
 
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
that's a problem
 
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:55.740 align:start position:0%
it's a problem
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
that we can solve however
 
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's a problem that besets both parties
 
00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:04.019 align:start position:0%
it disempowers voters on the left
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
disempowers voters on the right
 
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
and it disempowers voters who don't care
 
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
about the left or the right
 
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:13.260 align:start position:0%
it disempowers progressives it
 
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
disempowers Libertarians it disempowers
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
voters who don't care about ideology but
 
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
who just have common sense
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
and I think our politics needs more
 
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
people like that
 
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
this bill tries to re-empower Common
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
Sense it tries to open the door for
 
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:31.700 align:start position:0%
ordinary citizens in New Hampshire
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
people who know their neighbors who are
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
admired by their neighbors people who
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
are admired maybe because they coach
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
Youth Sports people who admired because
 
00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:41.459 align:start position:0%
they're the sort of people in our towns
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
and cities who say yes when they're
 
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
asked to do something when when frankly
 
00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
most people say no I'm too busy no I
 
00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:49.730 align:start position:0%
most people say no I'm too busy no I
can't

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:49.740 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
but those people who always they're the
 
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:53.220 align:start position:0%
go-to people and we all know who they
 
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
are and when people go to them they say
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm busy but I can do that I can
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
pitch in I'm ready though that's the
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
kind of Civic spirit that makes the
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
world turn it makes democracy work is
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
what I should say and and that's the
 
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
kind of those are the kind of people I'd
 
00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:10.019 align:start position:0%
like to see be able to run for for
 
00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
governor and have a viable chance of
 
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:16.670 align:start position:0%
governor and have a viable chance of
winning

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
um now nothing is perfect in in politics
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
nothing's perfect in Practical there's
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
no like I don't know no bill no plan no
 
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
system is is God all is on the side of
 
00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
the angels and and every plan has its
 
00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:32.210 align:start position:0%
the angels and and every plan has its
issues

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
um and one problem with this plan if you
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
haven't figured out already is that it's
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
not free
 
00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:41.339 align:start position:0%
um it would cost money
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
to fund this plan
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
and that money would have to be
 
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
would have to come from from the
 
00:10:50.329 --> 00:10:50.339 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire through some
 
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:53.579 align:start position:0%
sort of fee or tax it's too bad that
 
00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:55.019 align:start position:0%
that's true but that is true and I
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
confess it I've calculated how much
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
money this plan would cost if
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
um all the primary candidates and all
 
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
the general election candidates fully
 
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:06.860 align:start position:0%
qualified and and and
 
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
we're successful attracting the the
 
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
voter dollars right up to the to the
 
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.550 align:start position:0%
voter dollars right up to the to the
limits

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
limits
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
um which is sort of the high end of an
 
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
estimate and I've calculated it would
 
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
cost eight dollars per registered voter
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
per election cycle or four dollars per
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
registered voter per year
 
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
for some that will be too much to even
 
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.790 align:start position:0%
for some that will be too much to even
contemplate

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
contemplate
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
I think for some who think that big
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
money and out-of-state Elites have too
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
much power in our politics eight dollars
 
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
an election cycle will seem like a
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount to spend
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
to to solve a fundamental problem
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
to me it seems like a bargain that's why
 
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sponsoring the bill
 
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
um a bipartisan study group led by Brad
 
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
cook a couple years ago looked into this
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
idea looked into what it would cost and
 
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
brainstormed a page or two of ideas
 
00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:05.220 align:start position:0%
about how to fund it those ideas ranged
 
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
from slight increases in fees
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
such as motor vehicle fees or criminal
 
00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
fees to a clean elections Lottery
 
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.710 align:start position:0%
fees to a clean elections Lottery
um

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
one thing to note is that this bill
 
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
does not fund this system
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
this bill creates a legal framework for
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
the system
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
by funding it with one dollar so that
 
00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
there's a line item in the state budget
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
that can be supplied if and when the
 
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
legislature in its wisdom at a future
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
point should decide that this plan is so
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
compelling that it wants to fund it in
 
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
the meantime it'd be funded through
 
00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:53.579 align:start position:0%
fines I have to confess that I think I
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
might end up contributing to because I
 
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
missed a deadline
 
00:12:59.090 --> 00:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
um but that that's not the funding plan
 
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
in in in the in the end it would have to
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
be fully funded by subsequent
 
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
legislation this bill explains the idea
 
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
gives us the chance to explain the idea
 
00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:16.019 align:start position:0%
to our constituents
 
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
and gives the legislature an opportunity
 
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
in the future to fully fund it if the
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
legislature so decides
 
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.250 align:start position:0%
legislature so decides
foreign

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:27.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
the bill tries to bring full control of
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire elections to New Hampshire
 
00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:34.430 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire elections to New Hampshire
voters

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
right now New Hampshire voters cast the
 
00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
vote but they don't
 
00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
provide the dollars
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
in every election there's a primary
 
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
before the primary
 
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
it's called the donor primary
 
00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
and candidates have to compete in that
 
00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
primary before they can actually
 
00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
make a viable offer offer a viable
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
campaign to complete for votes this bill
 
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
tries to eradicate that donor primary
 
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
and give power back to New Hampshire
 
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
voters I hope I've been able to explain
 
00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:08.459 align:start position:0%
the intentions and the and the
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
mechanisms of the idea and Mr chair I'd
 
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
be happy to take questions
 
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:18.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you representative boehm
 
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
but we still have a problem but still
 
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
not going to prevent and that the U.S
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruled some years ago about
 
00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:35.339 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech out of state
 
00:14:35.339 --> 00:14:37.009 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech out of state
Pax

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:37.019 align:start position:0%
Pax
 
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
can still
 
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
Place ads with a lot of money can't they
 
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
there there would be especially you know
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
the campaigns that aren't connect uh ad
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
campaigns that aren't connected to any
 
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
particular campaign would continue to be
 
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
able to run by the way there's nothing
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
that would force candidates to opt into
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
the system so a candidate who wanted to
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
raise money in the traditional way by
 
00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
going to out-of-state Elites would still
 
00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:04.139 align:start position:0%
be able to do that so I think you're
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
right it's not like it bars all
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
political spending nor does it try to
 
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
um you know to to do an end run around
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional decisions that have said
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
people have the right to spend money on
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
political things nor does it borrow a
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
candidate who wants to raise money
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
in the way that candidates traditionally
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
have from continuing to do that so so I
 
00:15:27.889 --> 00:15:27.899 align:start position:0%
think you're right it doesn't completely
 
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
eliminate the the influence of money in
 
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
politics what it does is get what it
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
tries to do is give ordinary citizens
 
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
who don't have access to that money but
 
00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
who are admired by their neighbors a
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
representative Kennedy
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I had basically the same question
 
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of mention of
 
00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:55.139 align:start position:0%
limiting the power of Elites but I don't
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
see that this does this in any way and
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
what it does do is it as you said it
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
lets a small guy maybe compete oh I'm
 
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.430 align:start position:0%
lets a small guy maybe compete oh I'm
sorry

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
but I appreciate both the commentary and
 
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
the and the question
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
um and I guess I my responsibility would
 
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
if someone were to say it doesn't do
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
that in any way I would descent and say
 
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
it does do that in some way it it limits
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
the power of money in some way in an
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
important way but it doesn't abolish it
 
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't eliminate it so there's a lot
 
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
of space between
 
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
you know saying no money can be spent in
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
politics no private money can be spent
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
in products because we're going to
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
abolish the influence of money
 
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
completely and and saying that we're
 
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
um change the system so those without
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
access to the donor class can run viable
 
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
campaigns and compete with those who are
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
The Darlings of the Dorner class on an
 
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
equal footing
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
and that's what this tries to do it
 
00:16:59.329 --> 00:16:59.339 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't say those with money
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
are now un you know not free to spend it
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
um to advance their political goals what
 
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
it does do is try to create an Avenue
 
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
for people who can elicit large numbers
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
of small donations who have the support
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
of ordinary people in their Community
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
who have a reputation because of the
 
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
lives they've lived it tries to enable
 
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.030 align:start position:0%
lives they've lived it tries to enable
them

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
to run a viable campaign and compete
 
00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
with others
 
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:27.959 align:start position:0%
who who maybe are just uh you know
 
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:30.059 align:start position:0%
running ads because they know 20 big
 
00:17:30.059 --> 00:17:32.450 align:start position:0%
running ads because they know 20 big
donors

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:34.919 align:start position:0%
representative Barry
 
00:17:36.529 --> 00:17:36.539 align:start position:0%
um actually led up to my one of my
 
00:17:39.169 --> 00:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
points so uh the cap for governor is a
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
um in 2020
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
um Dr Tom Sherman raised one million 976
 
00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
that Mill 1.976 million dollars Governor
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
cenini raised 2.163 million dollars
 
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
um this would give a million dollars
 
00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
um so I guess my question is how did you
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
arrive at a million dollars and I can't
 
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
believe I'm going to utter these words
 
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
is that enough
 
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
no I think that's the right question to
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
ask because if it isn't then these
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
people aren't going to be able to run
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
viable campaigns competitive campaigns
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
so the million dollars is what a
 
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
candidate who qualifies and wins the
 
00:18:15.299 --> 00:18:16.970 align:start position:0%
candidate who qualifies and wins the
primary

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:16.980 align:start position:0%
primary
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
um and shows up on a general election
 
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
ballot get to run in that general
 
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
election they also get to raise up to
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
420 000 in voter dollars those are the
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
25 certificates that of which each voter
 
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
gets four
 
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
and which each voter can give to
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
candidates of their choosing you could
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
give all four of your certificates to
 
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
one particular candidate running for
 
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
governor you could split them up among
 
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.190 align:start position:0%
governor you could split them up among
different

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
um you know executive Council candidates
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
and gubernatorial candidates if you
 
00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:47.870 align:start position:0%
and gubernatorial candidates if you
wished

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
wished
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
um so there's another four hundred and
 
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars there there's
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
also small donations up to 250 dollars
 
00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
the candidates can raise and we're not
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
limiting those
 
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
so so that's not just a million and we
 
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
are trying to set these numbers with
 
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
reference to what is required to run a
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
viable campaign
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
um and and I think uh I think these are
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
these are sufficient but
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
you know because of inflation things
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
like that they're going to change over
 
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:24.110 align:start position:0%
like that they're going to change over
time

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
representative wood
 
00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:27.299 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little confused when you said
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
eight dollars per voter is it eight
 
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
dollars per voter eight dollars per
 
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.110 align:start position:0%
dollars per voter eight dollars per
taxpayer

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
could you clarify that yeah thank you so
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
what I did was I just um sorry about the
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
speaker that's standing between us I
 
00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
wish I could move it
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
um I calculated the the total cost
 
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
uh that would be involved if there were
 
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
competitive primaries in each of the
 
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
five executive council districts and in
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
the gubernatorial campaign and where
 
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
every single candidate a qualifies and
 
00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:03.500 align:start position:0%
then B
 
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
successfully elicits voter dollars those
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
25 certificates right up to the cap
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
um which is as I said 420 000 for a
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
governor and it's 84 000 by the way for
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
an executive Council Canada and then
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
looked at you know both people
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
qualifying in the general election and
 
00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:21.419 align:start position:0%
looked at the aggregate amount of money
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
it's about six million dollars and
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
divided by the number of registered
 
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
voters in the state and it's just a way
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
of of you know getting my mind around
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
how much it costs per registered voter
 
00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
um it's a way of conveying that
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
um and I I had to make a bunch of
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
assumptions to do that I I tried to err
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
on the side of it you know
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
um I tried to build in all the costs I
 
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
could imagine and come up with the air
 
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
on the side of making the cost larger
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
rather than smaller
 
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
um and so anyway it's registered voters
 
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
it's not number of persons in the state
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't include people who aren't
 
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
registered or aren't able to register
 
00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
something like that it's and that was
 
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
just the figure I took because I thought
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
that would I don't know thank you can I
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up be a good way of
 
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:09.059 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to wrap this quick so
 
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
we can get to our next one it's quick
 
00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned uh five to five hundred
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
dollars for donations and we need to
 
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
track this so if I if I get five dollars
 
00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
from somebody I gotta get their name and
 
00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
address is that how this works how are
 
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
we going to know they came from State
 
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
money or
 
00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
yeah you're exactly right you're exactly
 
00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
right so there's a Mr Burton for the
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
candidate and also for the state I also
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
tried to build in the administrative
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
costs which the which are contained in
 
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note in the estimate of the
 
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
of the per person cost and
 
00:21:45.289 --> 00:21:45.299 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
you know let me just say in response so
 
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
again it's it's the the defect is that
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
it involves Administration and cost
 
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
um it's not free and it doesn't you know
 
00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
just it's not self-executing
 
00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:58.909 align:start position:0%
just it's not self-executing
um

00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
and uh and I can understand if somebody
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
says well the costs are too high and the
 
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
administered burden is too high and I
 
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
don't see it where I mean they're
 
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
reasonable people can disagree as as we
 
00:22:09.409 --> 00:22:09.419 align:start position:0%
were talking about this morning
 
00:22:09.419 --> 00:22:10.130 align:start position:0%
were talking about this morning
um

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:12.299 align:start position:0%
you know what I
 
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
would invite you to do is is try to
 
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
understand the idea you know
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
try to like I had to wrap my mind around
 
00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
the idea see whether you think IT
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
addresses the problem whether you're for
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
it against it it's it's a it's a way of
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
trying to address something that a whole
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
lot of people say is a problem and
 
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
um and it's a way of doing it that I
 
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
think I just good faith don't think
 
00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
Advantage is the left or the right or
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
any other group I think in both of our
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
great parties today we see a Grassroots
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
element and we see an Elite element and
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
we often see them you know not in
 
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
alignment and and and this is a chance
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
to give that or the ordinary citizens
 
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
um the voice that I think they deserve
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair for the
 
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.630 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair for the
follow-up

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
there will only be two more
 
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
representative for Domo Brian
 
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm a little
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
confused about
 
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:13.340 align:start position:0%
how we would change over from
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
collecting fines for people with
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
campaign violations and in creating a
 
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
fund that way and then to what you say
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
is eight dollars per person how would
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
that exactly be collected from those
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
people who are paying the eight dollars
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
per registered voter do they pay it
 
00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
state level county level local level pay
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
when they vote
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
how does that work
 
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much for the
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate a chance to
 
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
clarify that and I'll do it as quickly
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
as I can the the big idea is that it
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
would cost about six million dollars per
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
election cycle to run this and the state
 
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
could collect that six million dollars
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
any the legislature could decide to
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
collect it any way it chooses
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
and it's not literally going to go out
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
there and charge each voter eight
 
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
dollars to exercise their sacred right
 
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
to vote that's obviously not what it's
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to do it might decide to initiate
 
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
a lottery a clean elections Lottery that
 
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
would raise sufficient amount of money
 
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
um and and and fund this it might decide
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
to impose a fee that would raise a
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
sufficient amount of money on something
 
00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.950 align:start position:0%
sufficient amount of money on something
else

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
um and uh including you know raising
 
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
criminal justice fee there's lots of
 
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:26.220 align:start position:0%
ideas and uh an earlier
 
00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:26.810 align:start position:0%
ideas and uh an earlier
um

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.149 align:start position:0%
um

Hampshire I'm a ghost time on I believe
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
in election integrity and we all do

thank you for giving me the opportunity

this four points that we'd like to talk
 
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
about on this bill this bill will
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
require the it requires the Secretary of
 
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
State to select a major supplier to
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
print and deliver ballots for the
 
00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:17.900 align:start position:0%
elections it makes certain that security
 
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
requirements are there for this ballots
 
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
and it specifies the chain of custody
 
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
for the ballots during and after the
 
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
election and it requires photocopied
 
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
proof of identity and residency when
 
00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:36.620 align:start position:0%
submitting an absentee ballot a new poll
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
has been conducted
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
and published by ABC News this month
 
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
and it reaffirms that Americans faith in
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of our election system
 
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
remains very shaken with only 20 percent
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
of public of the public saying it's very
 
00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
confident about the system
 
00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
this is a citizen-wide issue
 
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
irrespective of a party
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
70 percent of the Democrats 80 percent
 
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
of The Independents and 80 87 percent of
 
00:29:12.409 --> 00:29:12.419 align:start position:0%
the Republicans do not feel very
 
00:29:15.649 --> 00:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
confident in the election process
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
we need to address that with some
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
fundamentals here in New Hampshire
 
00:29:25.149 --> 00:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire plays a very unique role
 
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
in the country we are first in the
 
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.450 align:start position:0%
in the country we are first in the
nation

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
nation
 
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
and with this responsibility we should
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
be best in class in our election
 
00:29:34.799 --> 00:29:36.409 align:start position:0%
be best in class in our election
practices

00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:36.419 align:start position:0%
practices
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
the bill we are bringing forward is to
 
00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
strengthen our controls and increase
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
process transparency
 
00:29:48.409 --> 00:29:48.419 align:start position:0%
this will result in improving the
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
Integrity of our election process and
 
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
instilling confidence and our election
 
00:29:57.649 --> 00:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
results to our citizens and Country we
 
00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
are asking three things to upgrade the
 
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
ballot technology
 
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
with the growth and the absentee ballots
 
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
it is imperative we upgrade our ballot
 
00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:12.779 align:start position:0%
technology and make this part of our DNA
 
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
this includes reviews and
 
00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
recommendations on improvements every
 
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
five years by the Secretary of State's
 
00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.169 align:start position:0%
five years by the Secretary of State's
office

00:30:21.169 --> 00:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
this bill would upgrade our paper
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
ballots to include watermarked paper
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
magnetic inks and other available tools
 
00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
to prevent counterfeit ballots
 
00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.930 align:start position:0%
to prevent counterfeit ballots

tightening the business controls

00:31:11.289 --> 00:31:11.299 align:start position:0%
printed issued and unused with stronger

reconciliation and chain of custody
 
00:31:18.049 --> 00:31:18.059 align:start position:0%
requirements today absentee ballots are

not reconfiled and accounted for this
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
bill would require that all ballots
 
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
can be reconciled from the SOS purchase
 
00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.409 align:start position:0%

bill
 
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
I am the vessel to deliver this
 
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
I would prefer that any questions be
 
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
given to Brenda town or to Deborah who
 
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
they have been very very involved in
 
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
this process and saw how the process
 
00:33:18.169 --> 00:33:18.179 align:start position:0%
works and these are the expert
 
00:33:21.769 --> 00:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
testimonies and thank you very much for
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%

00:33:40.009 --> 00:33:40.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
um represent Panic we are going to need
 
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
is that good I feel so loud okay anyhow
 
00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much members of the
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
committee and Mr chairman for allowing
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
me to talk to this bill HP 482
 
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
um I am a long-term New Hampshire
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
resident and my name is Brenda town by
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
the way
 
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
um I'm a mother of four a grandmother of
 
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
nine my sons all serve in the military
 
00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.310 align:start position:0%
nine my sons all serve in the military
and

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:19.859 align:start position:0%
um I am also professionally I am I've
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
got a Bachelor's degree in accounting
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
and finance a master's in international
 
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
finance and I was a division controller
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
of a billion dollar division for Hewlett
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
Packard and so my background is business
 
00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:33.589 align:start position:0%
Packard and so my background is business
controls

00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
controls
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
and so I like to match those two
 
00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
together because there's a professional
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
side of me and then there's this mom
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
grandma and so both of them are sitting
 
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
here in front of you today to talk about
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
why we need your help I'm in the state
 
00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
so I participated in a Citizens audit
 
00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:51.409 align:start position:0%
so I participated in a Citizens audit
where

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:51.419 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
um we we've never audited the state by a
 
00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
third party so the citizens decided to
 
00:34:59.089 --> 00:34:59.099 align:start position:0%
take it upon themselves to go through
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
the process to see how our election
 
00:35:04.849 --> 00:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
process was working and you know we
 
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
found a lot of things in the process
 
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
that brought this bill forward and so
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
what I'd like you to do is imagine if
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
you will our ballots were hundred dollar
 
00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.109 align:start position:0%
you will our ballots were hundred dollar
bills

00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
and if your ballot was worth a hundred
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
dollars or you're handing that out
 
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
would you in fact handle it the way that
 
00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:24.599 align:start position:0%
we are currently handling it New
 
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and would you endorse and
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
support some of the recommendations that
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
this bill carries forward
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
so you'll see I left all of you this
 
00:35:35.089 --> 00:35:35.099 align:start position:0%
beautiful colored copy which I apologize
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
for killing all these trees but has some
 
00:35:41.089 --> 00:35:41.099 align:start position:0%
exhibits for you to walk through as we
 
00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
walk through the parts of this bill
 
00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
so as a controller and a financial
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
person when we would audit a large
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
corporation or even a small Corporation
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
we evaluate the business controls
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
because that's the Cornerstone of
 
00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
Integrity for the business
 
00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
the basic principles of business control
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
include the security of assets
 
00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:07.220 align:start position:0%
separation of Duties traceability
 
00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
reconciliation and audit and all those
 
00:36:13.849 --> 00:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
components need to take place if you
 
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
will pass your audit by a third party
 
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
CPA and by the way if you don't you are
 
00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
not allowed to trade on the New York
 
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
Stock Exchange you must be certified
 
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
so first the first picture you see is a
 
00:36:29.569 --> 00:36:29.579 align:start position:0%
picture of security
 
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
um this bill asks the state of New
 
00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to upgrade the way that we
 
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
handle our our ballots these pictures
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
were splashed all over the national news
 
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
when we conducted the Windham audit you
 
00:36:43.849 --> 00:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
can clearly see that we're using reused
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
cardboard boxes that have been re-taped
 
00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
reused with available with open gaps and
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
they have multiple colored tapes on the
 
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
boxes including the sides which could
 
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
have easily been split open and re-taped
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't exude confidence if you were to
 
00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:02.660 align:start position:0%
put your own money in there so again
 
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
this type of storage was seen over and
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
over again in all of the recounts that
 
00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
we did this past year
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
so again a critical part of this
 
00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
um the second piece is separation of
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
Duties you're going to find in this bill
 
00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
that we've asked that the Secretary of
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
State create a purchase order for the
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
printer of our ballots after they select
 
00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
them and qualify them in that purchase
 
00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
order should have the line item detail
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
by town of how many ballots they ordered
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
how many in person how many absentee how
 
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
many tests and how many overprints were
 
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.069 align:start position:0%
many tests and how many overprints were
available

00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
that's not available today we have no
 
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
idea by town the exact amount of
 
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
purchase that was made by town and how
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
many of the the specific towns received
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
I've gone through a lot of the
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
documentation in that information is not
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
readily available it's quite often when
 
00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:02.339 align:start position:0%
you go to the printer they'll see you'll
 
00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
see a shipping document that says ship
 
00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
per Karen LED and that I can provide
 
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
that data so upgrading that would be
 
00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
very important for traceability we'll be
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
able to go back and see how many the
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State who has the
 
00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
responsibility today and would have in
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
the future for ordering the quantity of
 
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
ballots that the printer would then ship
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
to the supplier I mean to the to the
 
00:38:28.849 --> 00:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
towns again the reason for this is a
 
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
basic tenant in business you want to
 
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
separate responsibilities so like a
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
bookkeeper you would never allow you to
 
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
your bookkeeper to take checks in cash
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
the check checks and then reconcile the
 
00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
bank account that goes with those checks
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
you would separate those
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities not that anything is
 
00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
actually bad going on but you want to
 
00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:53.099 align:start position:0%
prevent the opportunity so we're
 
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
recommending that we separate that and
 
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
today the secretary of state orders
 
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
picks the supplier orders the ballots
 
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
cuts the purchase orders receives the
 
00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
ballots then reships them to towns and
 
00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of play in the number of
 
00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.099 align:start position:0%
ballots which is my next point which
 
00:39:14.329 --> 00:39:14.339 align:start position:0%
hopefully by providing some separation
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
we can create a little bit more
 
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
Integrity into the process
 
00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
um the next thing I want to talk about
 
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
is traceability
 
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
so if you look at your next page I don't
 
00:39:26.569 --> 00:39:26.579 align:start position:0%
know how many of you have been in the
 
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
bowels of the election process but I've
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
included for you a copy of a moderator
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
certificate every town signs off the
 
00:39:37.849 --> 00:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
receipt of their ballots and they report
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
them on this moderator certificate
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that what's highlighted in
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
Orange is the only quantity of ballots
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
that any town certifies are there
 
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
in-person ballots no Town anywhere in
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire certifies the
 
00:39:56.329 --> 00:39:56.339 align:start position:0%
number of absentee ballots received so
 
00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
you've got a gap at the printer and now
 
00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:00.900 align:start position:0%
you've got a gap at the town
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that on the next page I've
 
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
provided you a copy and I apologize I
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't get the same election year so
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
you've got a 2020 a 2022 but the concept
 
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
is the same
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
on the night of an election the town
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
clerk will complete a moderator's
 
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
worksheet and they use as their starting
 
00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:20.930 align:start position:0%
worksheet and they use as their starting
number

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:23.220 align:start position:0%
you'll look at that that's line one of
 
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
the ballot inventory you'll see that
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
they take the number of the moderator
 
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
certificate this number represents only
 
00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
the in-person ballots they do not
 
00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
reconcile the quantity of absentee
 
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
ballots received there's no receipt
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
information there's no leftover
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
information there's no information
 
00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
reported on how many ballots weren't
 
00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
returned now I know that information is
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
available but if you're trying to audit
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
something you want the ins and the outs
 
00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately we don't have that
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
today and this must be remedied I'll get
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit onto that in a minute a
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
little bit further as you pace through
 
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
my really long deck and I apologize I
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you another couple of
 
00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
examples about traceability and control
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
um and an audit of a small Bedford
 
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
um a special election a candidate lost
 
00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
by 35 votes
 
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
when um the reconciliation was done with
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
the town there were actually more votes
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
that were cast than were reported
 
00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:28.140 align:start position:0%
actually shipped by the Secretary of
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
State's office to the town so upon
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
further review there were a few things
 
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
found the first image here shows
 
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
shipments to the town of Bedford both
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
quantity of 150 both on the same
 
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:44.220 align:start position:0%
purchase order so there was a duplicate
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
shipment making a total of 300 invoices
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
instead of just 150.
 
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
in addition the auditor was able to
 
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
review with her 98 1A privileges the
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
actual shipments to the town that were
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
available in a separate file at the
 
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office what she
 
00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:06.260 align:start position:0%
discovered is that there were additional
 
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
approximately 200 extra ballots that
 
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
were what are called overruns so when a
 
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
printer does a run of ballots they
 
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes end up inadvertently printing
 
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
extra ballots to ensure like when
 
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
they're running it they want the ink to
 
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
make sure it's nice and it's and it's
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
high quality so sometimes there's extra
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
prints in this particular case the
 
00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:31.820 align:start position:0%
printer had printed a lot of extra
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
overruns and those overruns were shipped
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
to the town but not traced or tracked or
 
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
added to the total it was not discovered
 
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
until a Reconciliation was done on the
 
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
official number of ballots shipped to
 
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
the town versus what was cast versus
 
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
what we had in extra files now I know
 
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
everyone's super busy and we don't have
 
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
standard practices so again the nature
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to upgrade our ability
 
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
on tracking these
 
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
the next sheet I want to show you also
 
00:43:05.569 --> 00:43:05.579 align:start position:0%
talks about the necessity for tracking
 
00:43:05.579 --> 00:43:06.770 align:start position:0%
talks about the necessity for tracking
ballots

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
so our absentee ballots as I just
 
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
demonstrated with the moderator
 
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
checklist and certification do not track
 
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
the total number of absentee ballots
 
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
so for because I'm a crazy auditor
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet not I went out to the
 
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's website and I
 
00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:29.339 align:start position:0%
downloaded the 2020 in the 2022 actual
 
00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:32.819 align:start position:0%
ballots cast and through the 91a process
 
00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
we were able to collect how many ballots
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State ordered from the
 
00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.710 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State ordered from the
printer

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
printer
 
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 election what we discovered
 
00:43:47.329 --> 00:43:47.339 align:start position:0%
is that there were 270 sorry 247
 
00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:50.540 align:start position:0%
000 absentee ballots that were untracked
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
untraced and uncounted that's on a base
 
00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:56.339 align:start position:0%
of about 814
 
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
000 voters
 
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:01.140 align:start position:0%
that represents 23 percent of all votes
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
cast had uncast untracked absentee
 
00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.770 align:start position:0%
cast had uncast untracked absentee
ballots

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
when you carry that forward to the
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
midterm you'll see the midterm numbers
 
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
below there is a hundred and four
 
00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
thousand seven hundred and fifty five
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
ballots that again went untracked
 
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
untraced in our midterm now I do also
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
want to remind you that towns have the
 
00:44:25.849 --> 00:44:25.859 align:start position:0%
ability to print their own ballots if
 
00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
they decide that they need some backup
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
ballots or they can use absentee ballots
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
to backfill if they run short
 
00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:35.220 align:start position:0%
so this is kind of a wild card in the
 
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
process and we need to close the gap it
 
00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
just completely exposes us as a state to
 
00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
a huge huge area of malfeasance as well
 
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
as it's actually an opportunity to have
 
00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
a lot of error
 
00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.130 align:start position:0%
a lot of error
um

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
we've included another part to this
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
ballot which I think more people will be
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit concerned about just
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
because of the the nature of it but I
 
00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
actually as a as a accountant think that
 
00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579 align:start position:0%
it's important we've introduced the
 
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
concept of ordering your absentee ballot
 
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
online to make it easy for the voter and
 
00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:13.140 align:start position:0%
I am completely all for that
 
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
but you can order that ballot unlike in
 
00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
the past where you would have to go into
 
00:45:20.809 --> 00:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
the town and ask for a ballot
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
in the case where you can order online
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
there's no validation that you are who
 
00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
you say you are
 
00:45:30.109 --> 00:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
if we're using birth date my audit team
 
00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
that performed a lot of this work was
 
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
very simply able to get birth date
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
information on a lot of the websites
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
that sell that information so as a state
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
in this absentee ballot process that we
 
00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
have in place now we've introduced a lot
 
00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
of risk so the recommendation in this
 
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
bill is if please go ahead and make a
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
make an application online for your
 
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot you know that makes it
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
much more easy for a person at home but
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
snap a picture of your license and
 
00:46:02.569 --> 00:46:02.579 align:start position:0%
upload that along or an ID or proof of
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
Dominic style so that we know that you
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
are who you say you are especially with
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
the number of absentee ballots that are
 
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
floating around
 
00:46:12.589 --> 00:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
the final thing that I leave with you is
 
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
just a picture of three examples over
 
00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
the past two years where we made the
 
00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
news for out of control ballots
 
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
and these were just small samples but
 
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
when I come back and talk to you this
 
00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
afternoon about the audit I will be able
 
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
to give you much bigger examples but I
 
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
just for this piece this is strictly
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
about business controls this is strictly
 
00:46:37.569 --> 00:46:37.579 align:start position:0%
about common sense it's all about
 
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
putting our votes into the same category
 
00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
we would cash in a same expectations we
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
would have on our investments and when
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
we put money in the bank
 
00:46:50.329 --> 00:46:50.339 align:start position:0%
so I really appreciate your time and I'd
 
00:46:53.569 --> 00:46:53.579 align:start position:0%
be glad to take any questions
 
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:58.140 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thank you

on what page because I'm I it's it's on
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%

00:47:50.819 --> 00:47:51.589 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%

hold up now
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have an amendment we're here
 
00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to to to field that
 
00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:07.619 align:start position:0%
question when the amendment is brought
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
forward I just don't have a copy of it
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
and I know that was added after I
 
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
drafted this part so I apologize
 
00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
otherwise I'd be glad to answer it for
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
representative boom thank you Mr
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking the question
 
00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
one thing reading the bill I see the
 
00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:27.349 align:start position:0%
one thing reading the bill I see the
problem

00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
testing right now this town clerk gets
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
gets the balance they take a sample of
 
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
the ballot not testing balance regular
 
00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
balance and use them for testing
 
00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
machines is that a mistake in your in
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
the bill no they they should be able to
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
get a copy of these identical ballots to
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
test in the machines to qualify the
 
00:48:49.079 --> 00:48:49.970 align:start position:0%
test in the machines to qualify the
machines

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
machines
 
00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
so they should be printed and available
 
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
for the town to do their testing
 
00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
follow-up but shouldn't the testing be
 
00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:01.140 align:start position:0%
done on the actual ballots not on quote
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
quote test balance
 
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
so today all our machines are are
 
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
processed with test ballots so a town
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
we'll put test ballots through in order
 
00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
to evaluate the efficacy of the machine
 
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
did I not answer your question I just
 
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I do no because the
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
testing being done today by rules given
 
00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:34.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to move on
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:49:39.839 --> 00:49:41.450 align:start position:0%
further questions
representative

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:49:43.849 --> 00:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
and requires the Secretary of State to
 
00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:47.510 align:start position:0%
and requires the Secretary of State to
supply

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
supply
 
00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
Select A supplier to print and deliver
 
00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
ballots and make certain security
 
00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
requirements is there any other state
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
that does this that you know of I know
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
many states have outsourced this
 
00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
activity to third parties like I can
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
just cite Arizona right now using
 
00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.250 align:start position:0%
just cite Arizona right now using
runbeck

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
runbeck
 
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
um I like the way that this bill was
 
00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
drafted because it gives the control to
 
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
our secretary of state but it also puts
 
00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
in place the requirement for a third
 
00:50:20.329 --> 00:50:20.339 align:start position:0%
party audit on that supplier
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they're executing to the
 
00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
processes this is kind of what we do in
 
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:34.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
and just looking over the bill on page
 
00:50:41.329 --> 00:50:41.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
does this mean
 
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
that I can choose and pick where I want
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
to vote where it says
 
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
he or she desires to vote
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
do you see
 
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
procedure of by applicant an application
 
00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.309 align:start position:0%
procedure of by applicant an application
form

00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
of an absentee ballot shall be mailed or
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
delivered to any person who applies
 
00:51:03.839 --> 00:51:05.390 align:start position:0%
delivered to any person who applies
therefore

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:51:09.049 --> 00:51:09.059 align:start position:0%
to the any town or city clerk it shall
 
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
be filled out by the applicant and sent
 
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
to the clerk of the town or city in
 
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
which he or she desires to vote
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
so that is the existing text and they
 
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
inserted the requirement
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
um at the bottom any applicant so that
 
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
is what is in place today so this bill
 
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
did not modify that and I believe the
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
intention is if I live in East Wakefield
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
and my intention is to vote on East
 
00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:40.140 align:start position:0%
Wakefield I'll go into that office and
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:48.049 --> 00:51:48.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr um chair and thank you for
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at the second or third
 
00:51:59.329 --> 00:51:59.339 align:start position:0%
page it's the moderators worksheet
 
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that there wasn't an
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
accounting for the state absence he
 
00:52:06.049 --> 00:52:06.059 align:start position:0%
ballots but there's a line on there for
 
00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:11.339 align:start position:0%
State absentee balance cast right so so
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
to go ahead please finish I was going to
 
00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
say so are you so could you just clarify
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
what you meant when you referred to the
 
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots and we're not getting a
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
picture the correct picture of the
 
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
numbers sure so what happens is let's
 
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
say a town receives 10 000 absentee
 
00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.790 align:start position:0%
say a town receives 10 000 absentee
ballots

00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
but only 2 000 people vote the 2 000
 
00:52:34.609 --> 00:52:34.619 align:start position:0%
people who voted will appear on this
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
worksheet they're part of the
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
reconciliation that tie out to the
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
machine count and the return of vote
 
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
that the town does
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
the other 8 000 ballots
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
they can be used as airplanes they can
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
be saved and uncast they could have been
 
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
used to backfill although it will show
 
00:52:55.849 --> 00:52:55.859 align:start position:0%
on this sheet on you'll notice on that
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
that same sheet and this is very
 
00:52:59.569 --> 00:52:59.579 align:start position:0%
important as well about business
 
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
controls you'll notice that there is a
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
line that allows let's see it says
 
00:53:06.319 --> 00:53:08.770 align:start position:0%
line that allows let's see it says
subtract

00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:08.780 align:start position:0%
subtract
 
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
official election day ballots and then
 
00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
below it it says add photocopy or
 
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots cast
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
um as official ballots so a town has the
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
purview to pull out of that absentee
 
00:53:25.309 --> 00:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
ballot quantity and stick it in with
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
people who need to vote in person or
 
00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
they can make the other choice and go
 
00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
print them in their own
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
um you know their own facility and so
 
00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
again that's another big Escape in the
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
process because you really don't know
 
00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
did they use absentee ballots did they
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
use printed ones and then you can
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
because you don't have the starting
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
number you can't reconcile and that's
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
why when I told you we have 247
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
000 ballots from 2020 that nobody can
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
really tell us
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
how they were used where they were used
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
where they are
 
00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
that's a huge problem and it starts at
 
00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
the devil's always in the detail
 
00:54:05.569 --> 00:54:05.579 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and when you get start to
 
00:54:05.579 --> 00:54:06.530 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and when you get start to
audit

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
audit
 
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
you start to find these gaps in process
 
00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
I hope I answered your question you do
 
00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:54:20.809 --> 00:54:20.819 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:54:23.329 --> 00:54:23.339 align:start position:0%
okay so and this is your third swipe at
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
it for the committee's information we
 
00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
still have one two
 
00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
three to go the and previous ones the
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
request of time to speak was five
 
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
minutes it was more like 15. when this
 
00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
public hearing was done I intend to take
 
00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:38.220 align:start position:0%
a short break and roll straight into the
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
executive sessions
 
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
and whether or not the committee gets
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
lunch today depends on how fast you can
 
00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
exec five bills because the other public
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
hearing will start at one o'clock
 
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.370 --> 00:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
can I
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
ask my question
 
00:55:06.049 --> 00:55:06.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:08.220 align:start position:0%
section two the moderator finds the
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
absentee voter has not included a
 
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
photocopy document submission to a show
 
00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
residency in the identification
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
so then the moderator can call the
 
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
the voter prior to closing of the
 
00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:26.329 align:start position:0%
the voter prior to closing of the
election

00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:26.339 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
so that person has to go there and show
 
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
that's the or they can provide a an
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
email photo they there's there's a again
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
when you're trying to get an absentee
 
00:55:39.359 --> 00:55:40.250 align:start position:0%
when you're trying to get an absentee
ballot

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't typically go into the Town
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
Clerk and request it and then ask but
 
00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
we've changed the law so that now folks
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
can ask online and by doing that you've
 
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
disqualified your ability to confirm
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
that the asker is who they say they are
 
00:55:59.870 --> 00:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
and so the only mechanism that we have
 
00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
is to confirm with an identification
 
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
and we would do that if we were asking
 
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
you know doing banking they're going to
 
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
ask us for an idea if we're going to do
 
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:14.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:31.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and committee
 
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
members my name is Deb Rue I live in um
 
00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
I've been a resident of New Hampshire my
 
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
whole life I'm currently in Manchester
 
00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
discuss HB 482 which I am in full
 
00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
support of I come to you from the
 
00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
background of being a mom and customer
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
service and sales are my background so
 
00:56:59.150 --> 00:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
I've done a lot of talking with people
 
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
and I know
 
00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:03.410 align:start position:0%
and I know
um

00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
I ask a lot of questions and
 
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I had no idea two years ago when I
 
00:57:12.049 --> 00:57:12.059 align:start position:0%
got involved in this whole process where
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
I would would end up and um what I would
 
00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
end up focusing on but for today I want
 
00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
to focus on
 
00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
um number three on the first page of
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
this bill specifies the chain of custody
 
00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:26.180 align:start position:0%
for ballots during and after an election
 
00:57:29.089 --> 00:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
I volunteered at the polls for the
 
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
primary and 2022 general election for
 
00:57:33.609 --> 00:57:33.619 align:start position:0%
the first time this year
 
00:57:36.049 --> 00:57:36.059 align:start position:0%
and like I said I wanted to understand
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
the process I just didn't want to
 
00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
understand my my own little job of I
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't even say little but of
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
checking in people I wanted to know the
 
00:57:47.569 --> 00:57:47.579 align:start position:0%
rest of the process and I was quite
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
surprised when I started asking
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
questions people didn't want to answer
 
00:57:51.599 --> 00:57:53.089 align:start position:0%
questions people didn't want to answer
them

00:57:53.089 --> 00:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
um they're like you don't need to know
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
that it's not your place which made me
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
want to ask more questions so I actually
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
got an opportunity to um
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
to view the Evans printing company that
 
00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
we currently use for printing our
 
00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
ballots and one of the things that
 
00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:13.140 align:start position:0%
really concerned me and um was there was
 
00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
this cage a three-sided cage with boxes
 
00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
for every town and in those boxes were
 
00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
the overruns of absentee ballots the
 
00:58:23.329 --> 00:58:23.339 align:start position:0%
ballots that no one ordered or requested
 
00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
they were just there in case the town or
 
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
city clerk felt the need felt they would
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
be running low for people that came in
 
00:58:32.569 --> 00:58:32.579 align:start position:0%
for further requests so they just have
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
these ballots standing there they
 
00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:36.059 align:start position:0%
weren't locked there was it was only
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
three sides
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
um and they were right next to the
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
printing machines and so I asked the
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
manager there Bob like why don't you
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
have these in a room with lock and key
 
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
and why aren't they secured and and what
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
have you and he basically said don't
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
worry the building's locked at night so
 
00:58:54.289 --> 00:58:54.299 align:start position:0%
they're not going anywhere
 
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
so I wasn't really comfortable with that
 
00:58:58.609 --> 00:58:58.619 align:start position:0%
answer so I called him back and asked
 
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
them a lot more questions and he
 
00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
basically said my chain of custody was a
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
locked building
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
and again that that just didn't sit very
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
well with me so um
 
00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
I started asking questions of my own
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
town clerk and I said can you tell me
 
00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
where you
 
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
capture the total number of apps and be
 
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots that you receive from
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
um and he said he doesn't and I said
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
well why not and he said because it's
 
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:32.460 align:start position:0%
not required by law
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm like well that's just
 
00:59:37.849 --> 00:59:37.859 align:start position:0%
a strange answer because why wouldn't
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
you want to know
 
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
and reconcile the absentee ballots you
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
do it for the general election ballot so
 
00:59:46.609 --> 00:59:46.619 align:start position:0%
why not the absentee ballots
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
and instead of him like giving me the
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
customer service that I'm kind of that
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
I'm used to giving to my to my customers
 
00:59:56.329 --> 00:59:56.339 align:start position:0%
he started asking me drilling me why do
 
00:59:59.630 --> 00:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
I want to know why why am I so concerned
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
about what happens to these absentee
 
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
ballots and again I come to you from the
 
01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
point that I've taken Constitution
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
classes I've learned why my forefathers
 
01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
came to this country I know what it
 
01:00:15.049 --> 01:00:15.059 align:start position:0%
means to be a Biblical citizen I know
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
that it's my duty
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
as a voter and as a resident of New
 
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to help and and point out
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
things when I see questions that I I
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
want to get answers to and my own city
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
clerk is not wanting to give me answers
 
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
and hear what I'm saying it's it's not
 
01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
even just hearing it's like
 
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
understanding and having it sink in to
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
make sense that what we're asking
 
01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
doesn't really even need to be a law
 
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
it's just common sense like any business
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
would track their inventory like I put
 
01:00:53.569 --> 01:00:53.579 align:start position:0%
an example in my my testimony here that
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
if you have a shoe store they're not
 
01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.210 align:start position:0%
if you have a shoe store they're not
gonna

01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:56.220 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
01:00:59.089 --> 01:00:59.099 align:start position:0%
count the inventory of every shoe except
 
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
for the Nike shoes they're not going to
 
01:01:02.569 --> 01:01:02.579 align:start position:0%
just leave those out like so why would
 
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
we do that with our absentee ballots and
 
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
again as Brenda said with a bank why a
 
01:01:09.049 --> 01:01:09.059 align:start position:0%
bank doesn't just count the ones fives
 
01:01:11.569 --> 01:01:11.579 align:start position:0%
and tens and leave the 20s to chance
 
01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:14.339 align:start position:0%
and it's it's just common sense like we
 
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
need to have
 
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
chain of custody that me as a voter not
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
going and trying to accuse My Town Clerk
 
01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
of any mishaps or any you know
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
any wrongdoing but I'm I just want to
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
see the paper it's my right as a citizen
 
01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
I'm a voter and as we know voters have
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
consequences whoever gets elected can
 
01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
affect my job can affect my children can
 
01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:42.299 align:start position:0%
affect the money that I the
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
discretionary money so my vote is
 
01:01:46.849 --> 01:01:46.859 align:start position:0%
important as is all of yours and all
 
01:01:51.049 --> 01:01:51.059 align:start position:0%
we're asking in um is that we can see
 
01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
where our votes and our our ballots are
 
01:01:56.770 --> 01:01:56.780 align:start position:0%
going that's that's the bottom line here
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
so I did provide you with some examples
 
01:02:01.609 --> 01:02:01.619 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:02:01.619 --> 01:02:02.390 align:start position:0%
as well
um

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
so for instance on the moderator
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
worksheet as Brenda
 
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned the line item four we just
 
01:02:12.289 --> 01:02:12.299 align:start position:0%
want like more transparency why can't we
 
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
have a 4A and B and add you know total
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
number of photocopied ballots cast and
 
01:02:20.329 --> 01:02:20.339 align:start position:0%
total number of absentee ballots cast as
 
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
a fictional election day ballots because
 
01:02:24.049 --> 01:02:24.059 align:start position:0%
like Brenda said you can use those for
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
official ballots if you run low
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
at the moment on the moderator's
 
01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:31.799 align:start position:0%
worksheet as was already talked about we
 
01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
only talk about cast ballots we don't
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
talk about anything about the total
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
number of absentee ballots received so
 
01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
we can do the same thing add you know
 
01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
line items there and this exhibit B was
 
01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:48.299 align:start position:0%
really crazy for me
 
01:02:51.049 --> 01:02:51.059 align:start position:0%
um in talking with my clerk he provided
 
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:53.339 align:start position:0%
me with because I'm in Ward 12 he
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
provided me with all of the ward 12
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
sheets for the process that they use for
 
01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
checking in the general election ballots
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
why can't we just use another sheet like
 
01:03:06.589 --> 01:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
this one and have it for absentee
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
ballots because when they receive the
 
01:03:11.089 --> 01:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
boxes as I saw from the printer company
 
01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:14.339 align:start position:0%
someone is hired on a temporary basis to
 
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
work at the printing company to do the
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
shipping of the ballots and when they
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
ship the ballots on the box it has the
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
total of the ballots inside so when you
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
get the general election ballots you
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
write on the sheet you count and you
 
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
verify that there's 100 in that box they
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
don't do that for the absentee ballots
 
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
why can't we just duplicate this sheet
 
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
and put absentee ballots on there
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
on the next sheet on the moderator
 
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
certificate it it says in there it says
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
excluding absentee ballots and ballots
 
01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:44.339 align:start position:0%
used to test electronic ballot counting
 
01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:46.740 align:start position:0%
devices why are we excluding our
 
01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots from being certified
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make sense to me so I'm
 
01:03:53.569 --> 01:03:53.579 align:start position:0%
recommending that we
 
01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
we up we change that or add you know the
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
line items for absentee ballots in there
 
01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:02.579 align:start position:0%
because we need to certify those as well
 
01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:05.339 align:start position:0%
and then I went in
 
01:04:08.329 --> 01:04:08.339 align:start position:0%
um created a
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
a chart with the help of my friend
 
01:04:10.319 --> 01:04:11.750 align:start position:0%
a chart with the help of my friend
Brenda

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
Brenda
 
01:04:14.329 --> 01:04:14.339 align:start position:0%
um like a spreadsheet that the clerks
 
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
could adopt to help
 
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
track are absentee ballots absentee
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
ballot reconciliation sheet it's very
 
01:04:26.089 --> 01:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
simple it's it's not anything like
 
01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
that's hard to follow I I just don't
 
01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
understand why we we don't have this
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
right now because basically what I'm
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
trying to explain
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
is an equation that I kind of put
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
um here for everybody to easily
 
01:04:44.329 --> 01:04:44.339 align:start position:0%
understand we're looking for the total
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
number of verified and certified
 
01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots that we get because
 
01:04:49.849 --> 01:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
they can get them from the Secretary of
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
State just ships them out or they can
 
01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
request additional ones that are in that
 
01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
unsecured cage that's just sitting in
 
01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
the middle of the printing company so I
 
01:05:01.849 --> 01:05:01.859 align:start position:0%
want that total and you subtract all
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots that are requested so
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
we have different categories of people
 
01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
that request absentee ballot so we want
 
01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
that total requested that were used
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
to be subtracted from what was received
 
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
and that gets the total number of unused
 
01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots and then someone after
 
01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
the election after the polls close will
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
actually go to the stack of unused
 
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots count them up
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
and that total which would be D will
 
01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
equal C and if they don't then we need
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
to find out what happened and where they
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
went and if they do then you just put
 
01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballots in a box secure it
 
01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
right on the top you know the total and
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
say that these are the unused absentee
 
01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
ballots and then they're put away for
 
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
the 22 months
 
01:05:50.329 --> 01:05:50.339 align:start position:0%
and that's all I'm asking you to really
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
consider and just go through the thought
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
process that I'm I'm coming from like
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
customer service and a caring
 
01:05:59.809 --> 01:05:59.819 align:start position:0%
point of view I I just love our state
 
01:06:02.569 --> 01:06:02.579 align:start position:0%
and I I I appreciate our elections like
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
I've never appreciated them before I
 
01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:06.059 align:start position:0%
know the work that goes in it I
 
01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:07.740 align:start position:0%

try not to stop you from your lunch I'll
 
01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
go directly to page four line 16 where
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
it talks about any excuse me any
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
application for an FC ball that is
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
presented in person the town or city in
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
which the applicant resides to include
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
proof of identity and residency we've
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
seen versions of this bill I think every
 
01:07:42.529 --> 01:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
year or this part of this bill anyway
 
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
every year for the past 10 years or so
 
01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
that I've been in front of this
 
01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:47.450 align:start position:0%
that I've been in front of this
legislature

01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:48.170 align:start position:0%
legislature
um

01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:51.049 --> 01:07:51.059 align:start position:0%
this obviously has a pretty big problem
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
to it which is that absentee ballots are
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
often accessed by some of our most
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
vulnerable communities homebound seniors
 
01:07:59.450 --> 01:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
um folks who don't have access to
 
01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
printers faxes copy machines other
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
things that would make it possible for
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
them to then be able to access an
 
01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot and uh and use it and so
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
even though I do appreciate that there
 
01:08:11.039 --> 01:08:12.170 align:start position:0%
even though I do appreciate that there
is

01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
um an attempt to cure it here there's no
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
pre-processing in this bill and so
 
01:08:16.849 --> 01:08:16.859 align:start position:0%
you're attempting to cure on Election
 
01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.229 align:start position:0%
you're attempting to cure on Election
Day

01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
Day
 
01:08:21.169 --> 01:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
um which obviously is already frantic
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
and hectic and we don't cure ballots on
 
01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
Election Day because the moderators uh
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
or whoever is handling the ballots don't
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
have time to then find the voter record
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
give them a call hopefully to get in
 
01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:32.759 align:start position:0%
touch with them maybe they do maybe they
 
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
don't et cetera which is why we don't
 
01:08:37.249 --> 01:08:37.259 align:start position:0%
cure here to begin with and so while
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
this is in the bill it doesn't solve the
 
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
problem so that's really the part of the
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
bill I wanted to touch on make this as
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
quick as possible I'm happy to take any
 
01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.209 align:start position:0%
quick as possible I'm happy to take any
questions

01:08:46.209 --> 01:08:46.219 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:09:12.829 --> 01:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David Scanlon Secretary of
 
01:09:15.169 --> 01:09:15.179 align:start position:0%
State and with me is Aaron Hennessey
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state and initially
 
01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.550 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state and initially
uh

01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary Hennessey was going to
 
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
make the remarks on this bill but after
 
01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony I I thought
 
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
it's important that I step in and just
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
make a few comments uh about the state
 
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
of our elections
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
um I I think what we're seeing
 
01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:40.219 align:start position:0%
in the testimony and the legislation
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
this session is a clash of the way our
 
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
elections have developed over a couple
 
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
of centuries
 
01:09:49.789 --> 01:09:49.799 align:start position:0%
and the way some people would like to
 
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
see the elections happening at the
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
current time where the expectation is
 
01:09:58.610 --> 01:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
perfection and accountability in terms
 
01:10:02.209 --> 01:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
of reconciliation and just making sure
 
01:10:05.689 --> 01:10:05.699 align:start position:0%
that everything matches uh everything
 
01:10:05.699 --> 01:10:06.830 align:start position:0%
that everything matches uh everything
else

01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you that that would be a
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
very difficult thing to achieve in our
 
01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
election process and to get there would
 
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
be incredibly expensive
 
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is
 
01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature determines the policy on
 
01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
how our elections run
 
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
and in doing that
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature elects Secretary of
 
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
State to conduct those elections and the
 
01:10:33.169 --> 01:10:33.179 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is elected for a
 
01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
two-year term and if you don't like the
 
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
way the job is performed or the way
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
election was run you can change that
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
person and put put somebody else in
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
place that you think can do a better job
 
01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
because of that
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
I think any Secretary of State and
 
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
certainly the way I feel wants to be
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
accountable to you I don't want to have
 
01:10:58.490 --> 01:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
to farm stuff out to third-party vendors
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
to do the job that I've been charged to
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
do because if they fail I fail and I
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that I
 
01:11:10.729 --> 01:11:10.739 align:start position:0%
am responsible for every step in the
 
01:11:12.729 --> 01:11:12.739 align:start position:0%
process that is related to an election
 
01:11:15.649 --> 01:11:15.659 align:start position:0%
and that's the way it is right now and I
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
discourage vehemently farming ballot
 
01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
Printing and ordering off to third-party
 
01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
vendors that then send the ballots to
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
the individual towns because I lose the
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
ability to make sure that we're doing
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
the job in the best way for New
 
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.270 align:start position:0%
the job in the best way for New
Hampshire

01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
there is a lot that goes into the
 
01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
printing process and I think it's
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
important that all of you see it and I
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
guess the invitation that I would make
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
right now is that when we start printing
 
01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
the ballots for the presidential
 
01:11:52.490 --> 01:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
primaries sometime next month
 
01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.830 align:start position:0%
primaries sometime next month
um

01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:58.490 --> 01:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
that uh that you come to the Press uh
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
and see how that operation works because
 
01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
it is different than what you have heard
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
in testimony here today
 
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
and there's flexibility that is needed
 
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
in that process as well for example
 
01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:12.410 align:start position:0%
in that process as well for example
um

01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
we print ballots from the printer prints
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
the ballots let me just say this too we
 
01:12:18.610 --> 01:12:18.620 align:start position:0%
use a local printer
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
the printer The Print Shop is located in
 
01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:22.790 align:start position:0%
the printer The Print Shop is located in
Bow

01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
Bow
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
and that works really well for us
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
because when we have to deal with last
 
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
minute issues uh let's say if a
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
candidate passes away and we have to
 
01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
change the name on a ballot or we find a
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
mistake where about a candidate's name
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
was spelled improperly or wrong that we
 
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
have to fix that very quickly
 
01:12:44.209 --> 01:12:44.219 align:start position:0%
um and we reprint ballots when those
 
01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
things happen and so we have to have a
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
really good working relationship with
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
the Press
 
01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
and we have staff
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
at the site during the time that the
 
01:12:57.229 --> 01:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
ballots are being printed and the staff
 
01:12:59.689 --> 01:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
there are the ones that take the ballots
 
01:13:01.490 --> 01:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
for each town make sure each town is
 
01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
getting the right ballots puts them in
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
the boxes properly seal them and make
 
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
sure that they get shipped to the
 
01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
individual cities in town so we have an
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
on-site presence while ballots are being
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
printed I know that when ballots are
 
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
being printed there's a sign in log for
 
01:13:21.649 --> 01:13:21.659 align:start position:0%
anybody that visits the press to have to
 
01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
sign in when they enter and when they
 
01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:25.270 align:start position:0%
sign in when they enter and when they
leave

01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
leave
 
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:28.140 align:start position:0%
and the building is locked so it is
 
01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
secure and we make sure that that is the
 
01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:31.970 align:start position:0%
secure and we make sure that that is the
case

01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
getting back to the ballots we print the
 
01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
ballots on large sheets of paper they
 
01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:40.140 align:start position:0%
might be almost the size of this table
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
and on each sheet of paper we will print
 
01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
ballots for different towns on that same
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
sheet of paper
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
and because different towns have
 
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
different populations and need different
 
01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
numbers of ballots there are always
 
01:13:58.490 --> 01:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
overrun ballots that come out of that
 
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
process and those are securely capped
 
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
you know inside the facility the print
 
01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.090 align:start position:0%
you know inside the facility the print
facility

01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
and distributed to towns if if they feel
 
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
like they're running low on ballots and
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
that happens a lot with absentee ballots
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
they usually don't run out but they get
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
nervous when they get low and so we will
 
01:14:21.169 --> 01:14:21.179 align:start position:0%
ship additional absentee ballots
 
01:14:21.179 --> 01:14:22.010 align:start position:0%
ship additional absentee ballots
um

01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
we know and keep track of the number of
 
01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
ballots that we ship to each Town
 
01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:28.140 align:start position:0%
whether they're official ballots or
 
01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:30.980 align:start position:0%
whether they are absentee ballots
 
01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:33.900 align:start position:0%
we know on the moderators worksheets how
 
01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
many ballots were used in the election
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
how many bullets were cast in the case
 
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
of absentee ballots those ballots are
 
01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:43.140 align:start position:0%
processed on Election Day when the
 
01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
moderator opens the affidavit envelope
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
that actually contains uh the ballot of
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
um in the case of test ballots each town
 
01:14:56.570 --> 01:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
is given 50 official ballots
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
upon which they're supposed to write
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
tests at the top of each ballot before
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
they use them so that they can be
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
identified as test ballots but their
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
actual ballots that get run through and
 
01:15:09.169 --> 01:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
test the machines
 
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
the the people that really run the
 
01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
elections are the local election
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
officials who we all elect in our cities
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
and towns to do the the job
 
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
uh that's a local level and we put Faith
 
01:15:25.490 --> 01:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
in those individuals to do the job but
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
you know some of them are highly
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
qualified to do it others are just
 
01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
learning and so it's a very human
 
01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
process when we're dealing with
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
thousands of local election officials
 
01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
the system is not designed to run like a
 
01:15:40.729 --> 01:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
business where you can put all of these
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
controls in place I have no authority
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
over uh
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
the local election officials other than
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
help train them and you know teach them
 
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
uniform standards on what we're looking
 
01:15:57.050 --> 01:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
for elections the Attorney General's
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
office is the enforcement Authority if
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
they break the law and if they are
 
01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
negligent then you know there are steps
 
01:16:06.169 --> 01:16:06.179 align:start position:0%
that can be taken to deal with that but
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
I am not their boss in the polling place
 
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
they have the responsibility and statute
 
01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
to do with the statute instructs them to
 
01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:15.590 align:start position:0%
to do with the statute instructs them to
do

01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
and so you know we see we see very human
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
problems coming out of polling places
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
Windham is the unfortunate uh uh
 
01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
stepchild not stepchild but poster child
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
of you know things that can go wrong uh
 
01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
in in a polling place and we learn from
 
01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:35.460 align:start position:0%
that and it's not to say that we can't
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
do do things better we know that we can
 
01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
and we're working on those many of the
 
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
proposals coming out of this committee
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
um are things that you know we encourage
 
01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:47.780 align:start position:0%
and will work on but it's a joint effort
 
01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
bottom line is we have to be able to
 
01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:52.140 align:start position:0%
have confidence in the results of the
 
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
election and I think you know
 
01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
for as long as I've been in New
 
01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:57.530 align:start position:0%
for as long as I've been in New
Hampshire

01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:17:00.169 --> 01:17:00.179 align:start position:0%
we run elections really well and I think
 
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
we have a reputation for doing that we
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
have not had any major significant
 
01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
failures in the election process
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
like we see in other states and I think
 
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
that's that's a tribute to the way that
 
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
we conduct the activities here so I'm
 
01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
going to stop there and let Aaron talk
 
01:17:20.689 --> 01:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
about the specifics of the bill if she
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
wants to after that but and I'd be happy
 
01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions when she's done
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr secretary and thank
 
01:17:31.490 --> 01:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee there's a
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
few points that I just want to comment
 
01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
on and one um kind of working backwards
 
01:17:38.209 --> 01:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
to forwards was representative hamer's
 
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
question about the
 
01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
um the proof of identity
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
um the way that
 
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sure you already know this
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
but sorry for repeating when you request
 
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot this bill would
 
01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
require you to provide proof of identity
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
that absentee ballot request is then
 
01:17:58.610 --> 01:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
processed by your city or town clerk So
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
in theory you wouldn't get an absentee
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
ballot unless you had provided that
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
information already so that the
 
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
moderator wouldn't have to check that on
 
01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
the back end of the election day
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
um in the beginning of the bill it talks
 
01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
about changes to updating of the actual
 
01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
paper used in the election and
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
um the secretary has already looked into
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
options of this including secure Inc and
 
01:18:24.239 --> 01:18:25.250 align:start position:0%
options of this including secure Inc and
perhaps

01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
um using official Watermark seals on the
 
01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
ballot paper themselves and that's
 
01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
something that we're open to and there's
 
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
options out there just recognize that
 
01:18:37.729 --> 01:18:37.739 align:start position:0%
that would cause an increase in the
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
actual printing process itself for the
 
01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.450 align:start position:0%
actual printing process itself for the
paper

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
paper
 
01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:42.890 align:start position:0%
paper
um

01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
see my notes
 
01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:48.900 align:start position:0%
um we um the Secretary of State's office
 
01:18:51.169 --> 01:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
has a working relationship with
 
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
Secretary of States across the country
 
01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
so I reached out to our organization on
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
the locked ballot containers themselves
 
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
to see if there's any other states that
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
use those at this time and
 
01:19:06.649 --> 01:19:06.659 align:start position:0%
um no other state currently has the
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
requirement to use a locked box right
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
now we use the you got some pictures of
 
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
the cardboard boxes that we use
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
um there there are states that require
 
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
locked ballot storage which is what New
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire already does that requires
 
01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
that locally and at the state level we
 
01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
do that but to have a locked container I
 
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
don't know what the cost would be for
 
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
that I just want to recognize that
 
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
um I think I showed you the different
 
01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
sizes of our ballots previously so those
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
containers would have to come in
 
01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
different sizes and then the the
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
managing of those specific containers
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
might be very cumbersome just because of
 
01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
the size of that they would be both at
 
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
the state level and at the local level
 
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
so there might be different storage
 
01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
options that your local communities
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
would have to invest in for that
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know the cost of what
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
that would be because no other state is
 
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
currently requiring that whether they
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
some local
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
counties or local cities or towns do
 
01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
that already I don't know the answer to
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
that yet so I'm still looking into it
 
01:20:13.199 --> 01:20:14.990 align:start position:0%
that yet so I'm still looking into it
um

01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
I think that's all I have to add right
 
01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
now and I know I do know that in the
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal note the municipal Association
 
01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
did say that there's a big expense for
 
01:20:27.649 --> 01:20:27.659 align:start position:0%
local communities to add oversight of
 
01:20:29.149 --> 01:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
the ballot storage via video
 
01:20:29.159 --> 01:20:31.010 align:start position:0%
the ballot storage via video
surveillance

01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
surveillance
 
01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:31.729 align:start position:0%
surveillance
um

01:20:31.729 --> 01:20:31.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:31.739 --> 01:20:35.149 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:20:35.149 --> 01:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
as a former or still licensed but a CPA
 
01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
and somebody who's to do internal
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
control Consulting for a living I do
 
01:20:48.169 --> 01:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
want to say that the the business audit
 
01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
that this requires of the printer
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
May deter printers from actually wanting
 
01:20:58.250 --> 01:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
to print our ballots going forward it's
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
very vague and it might be very
 
01:21:02.209 --> 01:21:02.219 align:start position:0%
cumbersome for an external audit company
 
01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
to come in look at all of their business
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
controls which would include HR
 
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
um I mean if any anything to do with a
 
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
business would be included in a business
 
01:21:15.410 --> 01:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
control audit and be cumbersome for the
 
01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
vendor and also
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
um under the right to know law and
 
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
expose a lot of information that a
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
private small company in New Hampshire
 
01:21:26.209 --> 01:21:26.219 align:start position:0%
might not want to have public knowledge
 
01:21:26.219 --> 01:21:28.729 align:start position:0%
might not want to have public knowledge
too

01:21:28.729 --> 01:21:28.739 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
and I I just wanted to add one example
 
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
of the need to be flexible
 
01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
um going back to the sheets of paper I
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
usually order uh paper for ballots many
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
months before the election and knowing
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
that there were concerns about supply
 
01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:48.179 align:start position:0%
chain issues I had ordered
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
the ballot paper for the 2022 election
 
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
a year before in the fall and as we got
 
01:21:57.290 --> 01:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
into the spring
 
01:21:58.970 --> 01:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
excuse me we were hearing from the
 
01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
printer that the paper supplier was
 
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
we can't guarantee that you're going to
 
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
have paper for ballots uh
 
01:22:11.689 --> 01:22:11.699 align:start position:0%
um So that obviously caused some major
 
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
concern we ended up doing a couple of
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
things one we went to a local pulp Mill
 
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
paper mill in New Hampshire uh Monadnock
 
01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
paper and asked them if they would be
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
able to produce a custom order of paper
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
that would fit the uh that could be used
 
01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
in the ballot counting devices that we
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
use and we were able to get a a order of
 
01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
paper from that for that purpose but we
 
01:22:38.689 --> 01:22:38.699 align:start position:0%
also in the last election decided to use
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
both sides of the ballot to reduce the
 
01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
amount of paper that we needed to use
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
just so that we could manage a potential
 
01:22:48.649 --> 01:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
paper shortage it was a national issue
 
01:22:51.290 --> 01:22:51.300 align:start position:0%
it wasn't just New Hampshire in the end
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
there was enough paper to to do the job
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
but those are the types of things that
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
that get thrown at you that you need
 
01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
complete flexibility in dealing with
 
01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
that and I'm not sure that a third party
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
vendor in that situation would have had
 
01:23:08.570 --> 01:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
the same skill or luck that we had in
 
01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
that process so we're happy to answer
 
01:23:12.410 --> 01:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:18.050 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
representative

01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
um in regards to the ballot security
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
during the election I have a question
 
01:23:27.290 --> 01:23:27.300 align:start position:0%
what happens to the ballots when they
 
01:23:29.330 --> 01:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
are kicked out of the machine
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't hear the last part of
 
01:23:33.169 --> 01:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
that what happens to the ballot when it
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
is kicked out from the machine when the
 
01:23:38.169 --> 01:23:38.179 align:start position:0%
machine refuses to receive it so the the
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
legislature passed a law requiring that
 
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
ballots that the machine reads as
 
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.310 align:start position:0%
ballots that the machine reads as
overvoted

01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
overvoted
 
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
get returned back to the voter the
 
01:23:51.290 --> 01:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
ballot is then taken and but by the vote
 
01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be placed in the side
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
pocket of the machine so that it can be
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
hand counted at the end of the night at
 
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
any ballot that's rejected by a voting
 
01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
machine would be hand counted at the end
 
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
of the night
 
01:24:09.770 --> 01:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
um was it recommended from the Secretary
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
of State's office during training for
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
the local officials to place the kicked
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
out ballot into an open box if a side
 
01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.590 align:start position:0%
out ballot into an open box if a side
ballot

01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:25.189 align:start position:0%
ballot
um

01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
pocket wasn't available
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
if a side pocket available was not
 
01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
available for some reason then we would
 
01:24:34.490 --> 01:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
our training would say that they should
 
01:24:37.370 --> 01:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
get a cardboard box you know put a hole
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
in the top of it and place ballots in
 
01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
there that's the same advice that would
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
be given if a ballot accounting device
 
01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
breaks down for some reason and to keep
 
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
the line from getting really long you
 
01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
know we encouraged the moderator to do
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
the same setups so the voters can put
 
01:24:56.810 --> 01:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
their ballots in a box and then they can
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
be fed through the machine later once
 
01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:01.340 align:start position:0%
it's up and running
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you
 
01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
representative Lane
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
um are there suggestions in the bill
 
01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
that you would support
 
01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
um or that you think are uh eat more
 
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
easily implemented
 
01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.250 align:start position:0%
easily implemented
um

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
first of all you know I think that it's
 
01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
the security and the ballot there are
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
inks special links that can be used now
 
01:25:32.450 --> 01:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
in fact you know I'm not sure if Wendell
 
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
Smith is here today but he has a a DNA
 
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
you know synthetic DNA product that is
 
01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
basically invisible link
 
01:25:43.729 --> 01:25:43.739 align:start position:0%
that the ballot counting machines may be
 
01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
configured to be able to read or if you
 
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
use a special light you can see it
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's special magnetic inks that could
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
be used
 
01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
uh Watermark paper could be purchased in
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
those big sheets provided that there's a
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
supply of them out there to get so I
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
mean things like that we would be open
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
to obviously there's an additional cost
 
01:26:05.629 --> 01:26:05.639 align:start position:0%
involved in doing something like that
 
01:26:08.209 --> 01:26:08.219 align:start position:0%
and and that's not to say that some of
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:26:12.770 --> 01:26:12.780 align:start position:0%
you know the the reconciliation measures
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
and things that are proposed in the bill
 
01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
aren't worth taking a look at and trying
 
01:26:19.129 --> 01:26:19.139 align:start position:0%
to do a better job with
 
01:26:19.139 --> 01:26:20.229 align:start position:0%
to do a better job with
um

01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has come a long way since
 
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
I've been in in the Secretary of State's
 
01:26:25.930 --> 01:26:25.940 align:start position:0%
office for 20 years
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
when I first started in 2002 we had a
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
set of statutes but there was not a lot
 
01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
of uniform training going on
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
cities and towns were doing elections in
 
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
different ways they were all keeping
 
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
their own unique checklist we didn't
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
have a standard Statewide
 
01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
checklist then and you know you travel
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
around the states and you would see the
 
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
way some election officials were
 
01:26:54.169 --> 01:26:54.179 align:start position:0%
conducting the election in the polling
 
01:26:56.209 --> 01:26:56.219 align:start position:0%
place and when you question them about
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
it they said well that's the way we've
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
always done it it didn't matter what the
 
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
statute said at the time so we've gotten
 
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
away from that and you know the polling
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
places are pretty uniform now but you
 
01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
know every now and then we'll find one
 
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
where the you know the traditional way
 
01:27:13.129 --> 01:27:13.139 align:start position:0%
of doing it still still lingers since we
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
deal with that but um
 
01:27:17.209 --> 01:27:17.219 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean we keep we keep making
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
progress and we keep making improvements
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
so before you do that so the committee
 
01:27:30.530 --> 01:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
is aware I do not believe that probably
 
01:27:32.689 --> 01:27:32.699 align:start position:0%
the 15 or 20 minutes we have is going to
 
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
be time to get these executive sessions
 
01:27:37.729 --> 01:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
done so what we will do is when this
 
01:27:39.649 --> 01:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
public hearing is over we will do what
 
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
we can recess the rest until 3 30 today
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
go ahead all right thank you would you
 
01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
need a statute to do the ink or to do
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
those Provisions do you do you need a
 
01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
statute to allow you to do that
 
01:27:58.370 --> 01:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful to
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
authorize the use of security measures
 
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:11.460 align:start position:0%

01:28:15.050 --> 01:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
our election officials sworn in

anyone else
 
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr secretary thank you
 
01:28:23.639 --> 01:28:25.250 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr secretary thank you
secretary

01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
secretary
 
01:28:26.689 --> 01:28:26.699 align:start position:0%
all right representative wood can I have
 
01:28:51.169 --> 01:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Nate Chris from
 
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association we we oppose this
 
01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:01.490 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association we we oppose this
legislation

01:29:01.490 --> 01:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
um based on the cost basis
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
and deferral all the process questions
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office
 
01:29:09.530 --> 01:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
um I did contribute to a fiscal note
 
01:29:11.570 --> 01:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
um and basically what I'm looking at is
 
01:29:15.410 --> 01:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
page three lines 16 through 18.
 
01:29:17.629 --> 01:29:17.639 align:start position:0%
um that as described would basically
 
01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
treat uh the ballots in their containers
 
01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
uh at the local level essentially with
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
the same kind of security you'd expect
 
01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:27.300 align:start position:0%
in a bank vault
 
01:29:28.610 --> 01:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
um that's not what the law currently
 
01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:29.930 align:start position:0%
um that's not what the law currently
requires

01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
requires
 
01:29:32.090 --> 01:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
I know that the secretary has answered a
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
number of questions about the process so
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
I would just add that last year the
 
01:29:40.370 --> 01:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
legislature modified the the process for
 
01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
keeping ballots the local level it did
 
01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
not require that video monitoring but
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
there is a visitor log process and a
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
sealing process and that's all based on
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
I believe long-standing practice adopted
 
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
from the election procedure manual
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
um and so I just want to point out that
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
it'd be very costly to put in that those
 
01:30:01.810 --> 01:30:01.820 align:start position:0%
video recording systems I'm not aware of
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
any municipalities having those uh for
 
01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
the purpose of looking at the storage
 
01:30:10.669 --> 01:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
area for ballots they may be incidental
 
01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
and that they have security cameras
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
around the building but nothing directly
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
geared towards this and there's no
 
01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
appropriation in here so ultimately that
 
01:30:22.010 --> 01:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
would be an additional cost for
 
01:30:23.330 --> 01:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
municipalities which of course they'd
 
01:30:24.890 --> 01:30:24.900 align:start position:0%
have to raise through taxation from the
 
01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so we're concerned about that
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
additional cost especially because
 
01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
realistically if you're going to put in
 
01:30:33.169 --> 01:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
the cameras for this purpose you also
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
need to have someone review them and
 
01:30:37.129 --> 01:30:37.139 align:start position:0%
that's not addressed in the legislation
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
either I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you questions
 
01:30:45.169 --> 01:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
01:31:09.310 --> 01:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you much uh yes uh Wendell Smith
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
is my name pollstar limited consultants
 
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
in security printing
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
um I've been in this business for 40
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
years now and
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
um one of the greatest things that has
 
01:31:28.370 --> 01:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
come along in the last five years
 
01:31:32.169 --> 01:31:32.179 align:start position:0%
uh developed because of my
 
01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
activities watching this process go on
 
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
in Enfield where I live and love and
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
seeing what are the risks and troubles
 
01:31:46.430 --> 01:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
that need to be overcome
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
one of the companies in this field
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
DNA Technologies which I'm connected to
 
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes and I have been Consulting
 
01:32:01.250 --> 01:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
over 40 years in this space visiting
 
01:32:03.890 --> 01:32:03.900 align:start position:0%
with everyone involved many governments
 
01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
trade associations and what I have found
 
01:32:10.209 --> 01:32:10.219 align:start position:0%
is what you know well that most
 
01:32:13.129 --> 01:32:13.139 align:start position:0%
anti-counterfeiting answers
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
do not really work at the end unless the
 
01:32:20.689 --> 01:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
people involved in the project
 
01:32:23.209 --> 01:32:23.219 align:start position:0%
believe and trust
 
01:32:27.649 --> 01:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
the system and in this case the absentee
 
01:32:29.570 --> 01:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
ballot itself
 
01:32:35.209 --> 01:32:35.219 align:start position:0%
so what's remarkable about DNA is it has
 
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
become obvious to all of us that it is
 
01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
better than a fingerprint
 
01:32:46.729 --> 01:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
it is reliable it lasts forever
 
01:32:51.709 --> 01:32:51.719 align:start position:0%
if you will literally and we we no
 
01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
longer use in this business several
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
companies are doing this worldwide and
 
01:32:59.330 --> 01:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
I'd like to express that very quickly
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
and have it seen in another time in the
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
materials that I Supply to you so
 
01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
we and others have been putting DNA not
 
01:33:16.250 --> 01:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
originally human DNA like artists
 
01:33:18.169 --> 01:33:18.179 align:start position:0%
enjoyed the prospect
 
01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
it's no longer human DNA we're not
 
01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
trying to identify a person with it it
 
01:33:26.689 --> 01:33:26.699 align:start position:0%
is a synthetic DNA made for the purpose
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
of in this case
 
01:33:32.810 --> 01:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot itself and every
 
01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:35.890 align:start position:0%
piece of envelope instructions
 
01:33:35.890 --> 01:33:37.070 align:start position:0%
piece of envelope instructions
[Music]

01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:33:41.090 --> 01:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
will be marked with a New Concept that
 
01:33:45.290 --> 01:33:45.300 align:start position:0%
puts DNA instead of onto an object for
 
01:33:49.250 --> 01:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
any counterfeiting onto a piece of paper
 
01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
so watching the process work and
 
01:33:54.850 --> 01:33:54.860 align:start position:0%
recognizing this new development
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
there is a process in which
 
01:33:59.330 --> 01:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
the paper
 
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
is marked before Printing and before use
 
01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
with invisible DNA and other
 
01:34:10.370 --> 01:34:10.380 align:start position:0%
UV or visible invisible lights that can
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
identify it for you and marked in areas
 
01:34:16.990 --> 01:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
that are going to later be important
 
01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
like where is this going to be marked or
 
01:34:23.450 --> 01:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
signed and um
 
01:34:26.810 --> 01:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
later on as the printer
 
01:34:28.689 --> 01:34:28.699 align:start position:0%
prints this
 
01:34:31.610 --> 01:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
pre-dna marked paper
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
with whatever is to be said or needed
 
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
that Mark the the invisible marks may be
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
behind some of the printed areas maybe
 
01:34:44.330 --> 01:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
on a space where the name is going to be
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
signed later or not the name in The Case
 
01:34:49.010 --> 01:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
of the absentee ballot there's no
 
01:34:52.129 --> 01:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
reference in either the DNA or in this
 
01:34:56.209 --> 01:34:56.219 align:start position:0%
process which provides any
 
01:35:00.169 --> 01:35:00.179 align:start position:0%
access to who it is it's getting it so
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
this married into the global system of
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
tracking things including the U.S post
 
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
office and others having become
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely the Workhorse the most
 
01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:16.860 align:start position:0%
important part of the process is it is
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
tracked reliably to where it goes
 
01:35:24.189 --> 01:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
and with a cell phone or a more
 
01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
expensive device but not needed
 
01:35:30.649 --> 01:35:30.659 align:start position:0%
it's tracked just as your packages are
 
01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
from every company and every post office
 
01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
in the world
 
01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:36.590 align:start position:0%
in the world
so

01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
with this process one can
 
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
go through by the way a very important
 
01:35:43.970 --> 01:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
section of all this it's the chain of
 
01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:46.850 align:start position:0%
section of all this it's the chain of
custody

01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
all every move that we're trying to
 
01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:50.510 align:start position:0%
all every move that we're trying to
predict

01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
predict
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
is helped by the fact that
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
the user
 
01:35:59.110 --> 01:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
can check
 
01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
the postal department or whoever
 
01:36:05.530 --> 01:36:05.540 align:start position:0%
delivers the mail can check
 
01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
on whether or not
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
the DNA
 
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
subject is there unit by unit
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
address party
 
01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
by a dress party so
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
What's Happening Here is in in the case
 
01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
of a DNA marked object and there are
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
many companies doing this now I have
 
01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
some materials to show what's going on
 
01:36:33.890 --> 01:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
in Europe and other places where it is
 
01:36:37.729 --> 01:36:37.739 align:start position:0%
accepted in crime labs are all adjusted
 
01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
to reading it the um
 
01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
DNA test for covet is a DNA test it's
 
01:36:45.770 --> 01:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
the same test
 
01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
there are now millions of places where
 
01:36:51.290 --> 01:36:51.300 align:start position:0%
this can be done so that there are
 
01:36:53.930 --> 01:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
millions of products being marked this
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
these days and now
 
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot by me having walked
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
through and enjoyed seeing how Enfield
 
01:37:04.970 --> 01:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
does it
 
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
they do it well
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
but all the steps that you've put into
 
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
the I'm supporting this bill
 
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
not in its totality uh but because it
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
faces very up to the very big risks that
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
happen can happen have happened and
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
might be provably so by someone who
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to stop the process but so what's
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
going on here is you're absolutely
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
putting everyone's eyes into the
 
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
inspection knowing
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
that they will be known to have had it
 
01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
everyone handling this from the design
 
01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:47.580 align:start position:0%
of the printed object
 
01:37:50.689 --> 01:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
to the pinning of it to the packaging of
 
01:37:52.729 --> 01:37:52.739 align:start position:0%
it to sending it to wherever it's going
 
01:37:53.890 --> 01:37:53.900 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:37:57.530 --> 01:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
recognizes the symbol that says DNA
 
01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:59.270 align:start position:0%
recognizes the symbol that says DNA
marked

01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
marked
 
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
they therefore
 
01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:03.370 align:start position:0%
they therefore
become

01:38:03.370 --> 01:38:03.380 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
individual supporters
 
01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
of the process all the way through to
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
the end when it comes back to to the
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
office for testing so
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
um for or for logging in when it's
 
01:38:18.649 --> 01:38:18.659 align:start position:0%
logged in
 
01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
so it's a
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's a kind of a change in the world of
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
authentication and anti-counterfeiting
 
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
to trust
 
01:38:31.610 --> 01:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
you can imagine if everyone's involved
 
01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
in this process knows
 
01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
that he has it she has it
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
she's moving on to where
 
01:38:43.370 --> 01:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
every time maybe you're already familiar
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
with the fact that every time you take a
 
01:38:49.729 --> 01:38:49.739 align:start position:0%
picture with your smartphone
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
it records the time date to the second
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
and the location by latitude and
 
01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:59.270 align:start position:0%
and the location by latitude and
longitude

01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
longitude
 
01:39:02.689 --> 01:39:02.699 align:start position:0%
that information and it shows then a
 
01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
picture of that
 
01:39:09.169 --> 01:39:09.179 align:start position:0%
here here's a example I've moved this
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
my eye doctors Prescription Pad
 
01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
so this prescription fat as
 
01:39:23.570 --> 01:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
16 things on the back that make it
 
01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:25.850 align:start position:0%
16 things on the back that make it
secure

01:39:25.850 --> 01:39:25.860 align:start position:0%
secure
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
is there any Security in reality
 
01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:30.890 align:start position:0%
is there any Security in reality
no

01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
anyone could steal one of those sign it
 
01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
the only security then is his signature
 
01:39:41.629 --> 01:39:41.639 align:start position:0%
which is no longer considered valid
 
01:39:45.970 --> 01:39:45.980 align:start position:0%
security and so this doctor who will
 
01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
help tell this story
 
01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
is very proud
 
01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
to do that for himself
 
01:39:57.169 --> 01:39:57.179 align:start position:0%
starting the chain of custody to that to
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
go on through so I have done uh this
 
01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:03.470 align:start position:0%
go on through so I have done uh this
on

01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.030 align:start position:0%
on
enfields

01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
enfields
 
01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:06.950 align:start position:0%
enfields
ballots

01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
personally for my own edification and as
 
01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
mentioned to David I've been presenting
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
those results too
 
01:40:19.970 --> 01:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State these are actual
 
01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
ballots that you can print off of the
 
01:40:25.729 --> 01:40:25.739 align:start position:0%
internet if you know you can go and get
 
01:40:29.330 --> 01:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
the ballot I uh
 
01:40:32.570 --> 01:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
mark them with a little red mark
 
01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
which might have been done
 
01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
by the but it doesn't matter uh by The
 
01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
Operators the clerks
 
01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
might have been done might have been
 
01:40:44.209 --> 01:40:44.219 align:start position:0%
done by the printer before he started
 
01:40:45.770 --> 01:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:46.430 align:start position:0%
and then
um

01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:50.270 --> 01:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
I watched I see how the people have to
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
put together this little complicated
 
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
package of items into the two different
 
01:40:57.169 --> 01:40:57.179 align:start position:0%
envelopes and
 
01:40:59.689 --> 01:40:59.699 align:start position:0%
uh first thing that happened for me by
 
01:41:03.890 --> 01:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
the way without knowing it was my uh a
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
ballot came to my mailbox at 57 route 4A
 
01:41:11.450 --> 01:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
I decided to press forward with this
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
project to get here today to tell you
 
01:41:20.209 --> 01:41:20.219 align:start position:0%
you can get trust in that piece of paper
 
01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
and you'll be able to know that if
 
01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
someone copied it there's no DNA
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
transfer of course
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
if somebody
 
01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.430 align:start position:0%
if somebody
um

01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:35.149 --> 01:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
took it to a different place
 
01:41:39.410 --> 01:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
and sent it back from a different place
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
it'll be identified so
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
it's a simple process I have some
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
examples of this going on in in Europe
 
01:41:51.290 --> 01:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
in particular right now where they've
 
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
changed the way they handle cash
 
01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
management to fill up ATM machines
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
present method if someone breaks that
 
01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:00.530 align:start position:0%
present method if someone breaks that
open

01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
open
 
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
they're sprayed with
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
blue fluorescent dye they're now sprayed
 
01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
with blue fluorescent dye and DNA
 
01:42:12.649 --> 01:42:12.659 align:start position:0%
the fact is in general people using our
 
01:42:16.810 --> 01:42:16.820 align:start position:0%
systems of DNA or antibodies are
 
01:42:19.850 --> 01:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
not bothering to test anymore
 
01:42:22.490 --> 01:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
that's not an example but the fact is
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
it's a trustworthy process I will leave
 
01:42:29.629 --> 01:42:29.639 align:start position:0%
in my testimony references to those
 
01:42:29.639 --> 01:42:33.250 align:start position:0%
in my testimony references to those
details

01:42:33.250 --> 01:42:33.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.450 --> 01:42:43.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
on the blue sheet we have one in favor
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
that closures of public hearing on House
 
01:43:02.330 --> 01:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:14.750 align:start position:0%
 
today

01:43:14.750 --> 01:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:16.850 --> 01:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
all right the executive sessions will
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
begin at
 
01:43:22.189 --> 01:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
11 55 and we'll see how many we can roll
 
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:52.020 --> 02:03:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:03:47.089 --> 02:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
we're gonna get going
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
we'll open the executive session on
 
02:03:52.669 --> 02:03:52.679 align:start position:0%
House Bill three two four representative
 
02:03:54.589 --> 02:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
Barry is recognized for a motion
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes Mr chairman I move that house
 
02:03:59.930 --> 02:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
bill 324 be an expedient to legislate is
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.570 --> 02:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
who was it uh Mr boam representative
 
02:04:05.580 --> 02:04:06.770 align:start position:0%
who was it uh Mr boam representative
bone

02:04:06.770 --> 02:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
bone
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
very bone Berry bomb which sounds like
 
02:04:10.970 --> 02:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
breakfast as I say that sounds like a
 
02:04:14.209 --> 02:04:14.219 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a marketing tool
 
02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
all right would you like to speak to
 
02:04:18.649 --> 02:04:18.659 align:start position:0%
your motion uh just briefly
 
02:04:21.589 --> 02:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
um uh this bill creates a voter dollar
 
02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
system uh in his taxpayer-funded
 
02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.370 align:start position:0%
system uh in his taxpayer-funded
elections

02:04:25.370 --> 02:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
elections
 
02:04:26.750 --> 02:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
um historically I've been opposed the
 
02:04:28.609 --> 02:04:28.619 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funded elections I don't want
 
02:04:30.169 --> 02:04:30.179 align:start position:0%
my tax dollars going to candidates I
 
02:04:32.570 --> 02:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
don't like I'm sure um some of my
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
constituents prefer their tax dollars
 
02:04:37.609 --> 02:04:37.619 align:start position:0%
not go to some some that they like and
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately it won't solve the problem
 
02:04:42.290 --> 02:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
that it seeks to address which is it is
 
02:04:43.250 --> 02:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
seeking to address the problem of
 
02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
keeping money and influence away from uh
 
02:04:50.030 --> 02:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
candidates um the reality is is the
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
money we you'd have a taxpayer system
 
02:04:54.229 --> 02:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
and you'd have people who didn't use it
 
02:04:56.330 --> 02:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
um the donors could then go form a Pao
 
02:04:58.010 --> 02:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
which we'll discuss later
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
um or a pack that money will still be
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
used to do exactly what they wanted to
 
02:05:04.729 --> 02:05:04.739 align:start position:0%
do anyways and in the meantime we will
 
02:05:06.589 --> 02:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
have cost the New Hampshire taxpayers
 
02:05:09.290 --> 02:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
upwards of six million dollars so that's
 
02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
why I will be voting for an expedient to
 
02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:12.830 align:start position:0%
why I will be voting for an expedient to
legislate

02:05:12.830 --> 02:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
02:05:15.709 --> 02:05:15.719 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:05:18.169 --> 02:05:18.179 align:start position:0%
representative boom yeah thank you also
 
02:05:20.810 --> 02:05:20.820 align:start position:0%
it doesn't do away with out of state
 
02:05:22.970 --> 02:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
spending and then
 
02:05:25.250 --> 02:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
what do we add State Senate races and
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
look at the state senate races they're
 
02:05:29.089 --> 02:05:29.099 align:start position:0%
cut they're people that contribute to
 
02:05:31.189 --> 02:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
them and when I ran for the state senate
 
02:05:34.010 --> 02:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
I got most of my money from one donor in
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
California but the problem yeah it's
 
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's not going to stop and it would just
 
02:05:40.609 --> 02:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
keep expanding it and it's not going to
 
02:05:43.550 --> 02:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
stop packs independent packs from
 
02:05:46.189 --> 02:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
campaigning out of state packs or
 
02:05:50.089 --> 02:05:50.099 align:start position:0%
country or or other agencies from just
 
02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
spending money I mean they don't have to
 
02:05:54.290 --> 02:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
say they can I mean they don't have to
 
02:05:56.089 --> 02:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
contribute to the candidate they just
 
02:05:58.490 --> 02:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
have to say Vote for This candidate so
 
02:06:00.490 --> 02:06:00.500 align:start position:0%
it's not going to really change anything
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:12.410 --> 02:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead
 
02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
um I really thought that I had
 
02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:16.679 align:start position:0%
representative Barry with my
 
02:06:18.350 --> 02:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
um extraordinary arguments this morning
 
02:06:19.910 --> 02:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm rather shocked that I didn't
 
02:06:22.189 --> 02:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
persuade him but I did just want to note
 
02:06:23.810 --> 02:06:23.820 align:start position:0%
uh very briefly that though it wouldn't
 
02:06:26.089 --> 02:06:26.099 align:start position:0%
stop money I do think it would improve
 
02:06:28.850 --> 02:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
the situation by create an Avenue for
 
02:06:30.770 --> 02:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
candidates ordinary citizen candidates
 
02:06:33.290 --> 02:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
with a lot of local support and I'm not
 
02:06:34.669 --> 02:06:34.679 align:start position:0%
going to expand on that because
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
apparently I've already failed to uh to
 
02:06:39.470 --> 02:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
persuade my erstwhile colleagues but I
 
02:06:41.750 --> 02:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
did just want to know that let the
 
02:06:43.129 --> 02:06:43.139 align:start position:0%
committee know that I am not giving up
 
02:06:45.950 --> 02:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for being a good
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to highlight that um
 
02:06:54.589 --> 02:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
one bill is not going to solve all the
 
02:06:57.530 --> 02:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
money the dark money problems bill has
 
02:07:00.530 --> 02:07:00.540 align:start position:0%
to be taken as part of that step so I
 
02:07:02.629 --> 02:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't expect one bill to solve all
 
02:07:04.729 --> 02:07:04.739 align:start position:0%
the issues and
 
02:07:07.490 --> 02:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
and to speak to representative mom's
 
02:07:10.729 --> 02:07:10.739 align:start position:0%
point there are other bills that we need
 
02:07:12.010 --> 02:07:12.020 align:start position:0%
to enact
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
to solve that problem and one of them
 
02:07:19.930 --> 02:07:19.940 align:start position:0%
would be HB 195. so that's all
 
02:07:22.629 --> 02:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
nice slip in at the end
 
02:07:24.830 --> 02:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
I don't even have a chance to grab the
 
02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:25.850 align:start position:0%
I don't even have a chance to grab the
gobble

02:07:25.850 --> 02:07:25.860 align:start position:0%
gobble
 
02:07:28.129 --> 02:07:28.139 align:start position:0%

the house calendar with no

recommendation and I will need a
 
02:11:04.970 --> 02:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
committee report the verbiage should be
 
02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
supporters of an expedient to
 
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
legislative and supporters of ought to
 
02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:12.589 align:start position:0%
legislative and supporters of ought to
pass

02:11:12.589 --> 02:11:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:16.850 --> 02:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:20.270 --> 02:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'll get it later
 
02:11:22.729 --> 02:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
so who will Who will do those committee
 
02:11:22.739 --> 02:11:24.189 align:start position:0%
so who will Who will do those committee
reports

02:11:24.189 --> 02:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
reports
 
02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
Barry and Mir head and I will need them
 
02:11:26.820 --> 02:11:31.149 align:start position:0%
Barry and Mir head and I will need them
today

02:11:31.149 --> 02:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
02:11:37.490 --> 02:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
and uh and so this these all committee
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
reports I don't know if I mentioned it
 
02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
before I get reviewed by both the house
 
02:11:42.410 --> 02:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
Clerk and the speaker
 
02:11:42.420 --> 02:11:43.910 align:start position:0%
Clerk and the speaker
so

02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
the way we can get into trouble is by
 
02:11:49.490 --> 02:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
stating beliefs as facts so if it isn't
 
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
an explicit fact the correct language is
 
02:11:57.169 --> 02:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:58.910 --> 02:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
and this way the reports are factually
 
02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:02.930 align:start position:0%
and this way the reports are factually
correct

02:12:02.930 --> 02:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
nope and that closes the executive
 
02:12:21.669 --> 02:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:24.169 --> 02:12:24.179 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna set a record with this
 
02:12:24.179 --> 02:12:26.810 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna set a record with this
one

02:12:26.810 --> 02:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:28.850 --> 02:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
open the executive session on House Bill
 
02:12:32.209 --> 02:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
453 and recess the executive session on
 
02:12:40.189 --> 02:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:57.470 --> 02:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:58.850 --> 02:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
what's up
 
02:13:03.229 --> 02:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:05.930 --> 02:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
we'll open the executive session on
 
02:13:09.229 --> 02:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
House Bill 508 and representative wary
 
02:13:10.970 --> 02:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a motion
 
02:13:13.669 --> 02:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a motion that be 508
 
02:13:15.530 --> 02:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
would be in expedient to legislate
 
02:13:19.069 --> 02:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
Larry boom
 
02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:23.089 align:start position:0%
Larry boom
wary

02:13:23.089 --> 02:13:23.099 align:start position:0%
wary
 
02:13:23.099 --> 02:13:27.470 align:start position:0%
wary
exactly

02:13:27.470 --> 02:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
yes uh just briefly I think it
 
02:13:37.370 --> 02:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
02:13:42.109 --> 02:13:42.119 align:start position:0%
proposes a solution to a
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
problem that might be handled better in
 
02:13:47.870 --> 02:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
other ways I
 
02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:48.970 align:start position:0%
other ways I
the

02:13:48.970 --> 02:13:48.980 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:13:50.990 --> 02:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
expenditure of a hundred thousand
 
02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:52.370 align:start position:0%
expenditure of a hundred thousand
dollars

02:13:52.370 --> 02:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:13:54.050 --> 02:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
growing in time
 
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
for absentee ballots doesn't seem to
 
02:14:01.370 --> 02:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
be the I think the appropriate mechanism
 
02:14:02.629 --> 02:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
to handle
 
02:14:06.290 --> 02:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
uh challenges to get those absentee
 
02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:09.410 align:start position:0%
uh challenges to get those absentee
balances

02:14:09.410 --> 02:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:13.609 --> 02:14:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:14.890 --> 02:14:14.900 align:start position:0%
was that
 
02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative boom
 
02:14:20.270 --> 02:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh also too
 
02:14:24.770 --> 02:14:24.780 align:start position:0%
um we just recessed 453 which will
 
02:14:27.770 --> 02:14:27.780 align:start position:0%
cost what the cost is going to be uh on
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
payment of uh absentee balance so I
 
02:14:32.990 --> 02:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
think this is premature for right now so
 
02:14:35.450 --> 02:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
yeah we should it element and it puts
 
02:14:38.149 --> 02:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
the money for the state paying it and
 
02:14:40.850 --> 02:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
remember though also
 
02:14:43.729 --> 02:14:43.739 align:start position:0%
what do we also pay for the gas going to
 
02:14:47.390 --> 02:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
the polling place so I mean it's one or
 
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
the other you either pay postage or you
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
pay for your gas
 
02:14:55.490 --> 02:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:59.149 --> 02:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
for the discussion representative Howard
 
02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
yes uh HP 508 addresses an issue of a
 
02:15:07.609 --> 02:15:07.619 align:start position:0%
poll tax essentially uh postage should
 
02:15:11.149 --> 02:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
be paid for by the state because it is a
 
02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
barrier even if it is a small one
 
02:15:16.250 --> 02:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
you know when we're talking about paying
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
for gas uh that is an issue where we
 
02:15:20.530 --> 02:15:20.540 align:start position:0%
could address that in a separate bill
 
02:15:24.430 --> 02:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
but this tackles a very specific issue
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh and it's just supposed to remove any
 
02:15:30.649 --> 02:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
barrier uh that may stand in the way of
 
02:15:34.430 --> 02:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:36.530 --> 02:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
representative Barry Oh yes I'll be
 
02:15:37.970 --> 02:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
voting uh for the motion of index being
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
to legislate the notion that paying
 
02:15:42.530 --> 02:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
postage on your absentee ballot is a
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
poll tax is uh
 
02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:47.390 align:start position:0%
poll tax is uh
ridiculous

02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
 
02:15:49.790 --> 02:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
um there is always a cost to vote in
 
02:15:52.729 --> 02:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
some way should we give them a pin
 
02:15:54.050 --> 02:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
um to fill out their ballot when they
 
02:15:56.450 --> 02:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
when we send them the absentee ballot
 
02:15:59.450 --> 02:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
voting unfortunately has a cost driving
 
02:16:01.910 --> 02:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
to the polls has a cost not outside of
 
02:16:03.950 --> 02:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
the gasoline your time has a cost
 
02:16:06.709 --> 02:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
everything has a cost we don't need to
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
create two classes of Voters by saying
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
we will completely Finance you if you
 
02:16:13.250 --> 02:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
pull an absentee ballot but if you
 
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
decide to drive to the polls nope you
 
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
get to burn the entire cost we don't do
 
02:16:19.609 --> 02:16:19.619 align:start position:0%
that here I will be voting in expedient
 
02:16:22.609 --> 02:16:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:27.589 --> 02:16:27.599 align:start position:0%
okay then
 
02:16:30.530 --> 02:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
the motion is an expedient to legislate
 
02:16:32.209 --> 02:16:32.219 align:start position:0%

02:22:20.160 --> 02:22:34.730 align:start position:0%
two zero two three zero one zero six H
second

02:22:34.730 --> 02:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:37.070 --> 02:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
yeah now would you like to speak to that
 
02:22:39.170 --> 02:22:39.180 align:start position:0%
motion representative Wayne uh yes
 
02:22:39.180 --> 02:22:40.130 align:start position:0%
motion representative Wayne uh yes
please

02:22:40.130 --> 02:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:22:40.140 --> 02:22:40.969 align:start position:0%
please
um

02:22:40.969 --> 02:22:40.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:44.750 --> 02:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
as as uh I testified I think last week
 
02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment would change this from
 
02:22:52.190 --> 02:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
a commission to a committee
 
02:22:55.670 --> 02:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
um and I put the bill in uh to and it
 
02:22:58.490 --> 02:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
changes who's appointed to it
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
um it's not as many people there's six
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
folks from the house and two from the
 
02:23:06.889 --> 02:23:06.899 align:start position:0%
senate senate
 
02:23:10.790 --> 02:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
um the idea is to do study of campaign
 
02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
Finance which came out of the
 
02:23:14.330 --> 02:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the Secretary of
 
02:23:14.340 --> 02:23:15.429 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the Secretary of
State's

02:23:15.429 --> 02:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
State's
 
02:23:19.550 --> 02:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh committee special committee on voter
 
02:23:22.250 --> 02:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
protection so this would look just at
 
02:23:24.590 --> 02:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
the campaign Finance sections of the in
 
02:23:28.010 --> 02:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
of the uh election law not all of the
 
02:23:29.330 --> 02:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
election law
 
02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
so and it's my understanding that
 
02:23:34.250 --> 02:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State testified that they
 
02:23:39.230 --> 02:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:41.090 --> 02:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the amendment
 
02:23:43.309 --> 02:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
representative Berry is are we
 
02:23:44.510 --> 02:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
supporting the amendment I do have
 
02:23:46.370 --> 02:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
issues with the underlying bill
 
02:23:48.170 --> 02:23:48.180 align:start position:0%
um however an interest of courtesy to
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
the other members I believe that if
 
02:23:51.770 --> 02:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
there's limits operating in good faith
 
02:23:52.969 --> 02:23:52.979 align:start position:0%
even if you have issues with the
 
02:23:54.889 --> 02:23:54.899 align:start position:0%
underlying bill it's prudent to support
 
02:23:54.899 --> 02:23:56.929 align:start position:0%
underlying bill it's prudent to support
them

02:23:56.929 --> 02:23:56.939 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:23:59.210 --> 02:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:24:02.809 --> 02:24:02.819 align:start position:0%
okay the motion is whether to adopt
 
02:24:08.290 --> 02:24:08.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:12.650 --> 02:24:12.660 align:start position:0%

02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:54.110 --> 02:24:54.120 align:start position:0%

02:24:56.050 --> 02:24:56.060 align:start position:0%

representative Howard
yes

02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:01.560 align:start position:0%

02:25:12.170 --> 02:25:12.180 align:start position:0%
that is twenty to zero excuse me and the
 
02:25:14.389 --> 02:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
amendment I was skipped oh oh I'm so
 
02:25:16.070 --> 02:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
sorry that's okay representative Burnham
 
02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
02:25:20.690 --> 02:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
now it's 20 to zero all right and the
 
02:25:23.110 --> 02:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
amendment's still adopted so that's nice
 
02:25:26.510 --> 02:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
so no the Parliamentary situation is the
 
02:25:28.849 --> 02:25:28.859 align:start position:0%
beginning of the amendment says amend
 
02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
the bill by replacing all after the
 
02:25:32.809 --> 02:25:32.819 align:start position:0%
enacting Clause with the following that
 
02:25:35.690 --> 02:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
means this amendment is now the bill
 
02:25:41.090 --> 02:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:43.309 --> 02:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
representative Barry
 
02:25:46.190 --> 02:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
um I'll be opposing this um I do believe
 
02:25:48.530 --> 02:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor is acting in incredibly
 
02:25:49.730 --> 02:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
good faith
 
02:25:52.309 --> 02:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
um I just question it's necessity given
 
02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
that when reviewing it
 
02:25:56.750 --> 02:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
um it appears that it's basically the
 
02:25:58.849 --> 02:25:58.859 align:start position:0%
functions of this committee right so
 
02:26:00.349 --> 02:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
like this committee is supposed to
 
02:26:02.750 --> 02:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
review election law it falls underneath
 
02:26:05.090 --> 02:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
our purview I'd much rather see us just
 
02:26:06.889 --> 02:26:06.899 align:start position:0%
form a subcommittee
 
02:26:08.389 --> 02:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
um and just work on it as a committee
 
02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
than to enact RSA incur all the costs
 
02:26:13.010 --> 02:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
that go with that
 
02:26:15.410 --> 02:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing wrong with in my
 
02:26:16.490 --> 02:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
opinion there's nothing wrong with the
 
02:26:18.349 --> 02:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
actual bill itself as amended
 
02:26:20.270 --> 02:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
um even before amended I just don't
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
believe it's necessary and I will say if
 
02:26:25.070 --> 02:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
this committee wanted to form a
 
02:26:26.450 --> 02:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and review this I'd happy
 
02:26:28.309 --> 02:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
to be on it and be a part of it
 
02:26:29.929 --> 02:26:29.939 align:start position:0%
um I'm not opposed to what this is
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
trying to to do I'm just opposed to how
 
02:26:33.410 --> 02:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
it's trying to do it because I believe
 
02:26:35.450 --> 02:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
that is our job on this committee to do
 
02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:43.130 --> 02:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:43.140 --> 02:26:45.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:26:45.290 --> 02:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:26:47.809 --> 02:26:47.819 align:start position:0%

the citizens of New Hampshire are I'm
 
03:09:29.330 --> 03:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
not going to say demanding I want to use
 
03:09:31.730 --> 03:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
the word pressing
 
03:09:33.830 --> 03:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
for a forensic audit of the election
 
03:09:37.370 --> 03:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
process to determine the overall health
 
03:09:39.830 --> 03:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
of the you know of the New Hampshire
 
03:09:41.690 --> 03:09:41.700 align:start position:0%
election process
 
03:09:44.450 --> 03:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
this request sits on the lower voters
 
03:09:49.190 --> 03:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:51.530 --> 03:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
you will hear testimony today on the
 
03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
findings of citizens audit efforts and
 
03:09:57.650 --> 03:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
personal experiences that support this
 
03:09:59.570 --> 03:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
Rising concern
 
03:10:02.450 --> 03:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
and give it validity to the need for
 
03:10:03.830 --> 03:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
this audit
 
03:10:06.830 --> 03:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
this is also our opportunity to back up
 
03:10:08.330 --> 03:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
the work
 
03:10:10.490 --> 03:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
from the 2022 vote of confidence
 
03:10:13.250 --> 03:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
committee who heard testimony but were
 
03:10:16.309 --> 03:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
unable to substantiate the claims of
 
03:10:18.230 --> 03:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
those who participated
 
03:10:19.969 --> 03:10:19.979 align:start position:0%
it is up to us
 
03:10:22.670 --> 03:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
the legislators to hear the voices of
 
03:10:23.750 --> 03:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
the people
 
03:10:26.150 --> 03:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has never had a thorough
 
03:10:29.570 --> 03:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
audit of our election process we are
 
03:10:31.309 --> 03:10:31.319 align:start position:0%
long overdue
 
03:10:35.210 --> 03:10:35.220 align:start position:0%
the purpose of House Bill 599 is to use
 
03:10:39.710 --> 03:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
samples of 15 towns with targeted races
 
03:10:41.929 --> 03:10:41.939 align:start position:0%
Senate Congress and governor
 
03:10:45.050 --> 03:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
as a test case and audit it with
 
03:10:48.410 --> 03:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
impartial never before used third party
 
03:10:51.710 --> 03:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
who can provide an evaluation of the New
 
03:10:54.530 --> 03:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire election process and tools
 
03:10:56.929 --> 03:10:56.939 align:start position:0%
should there be a larger than a two
 
03:10:59.210 --> 03:10:59.220 align:start position:0%
percent Gap
 
03:11:02.510 --> 03:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
a larger sample would be taken to assess
 
03:11:05.330 --> 03:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
the scope of the process issues
 
03:11:08.290 --> 03:11:08.300 align:start position:0%
the effort will be absent of personal
 
03:11:08.300 --> 03:11:10.929 align:start position:0%
the effort will be absent of personal
personal

03:11:10.929 --> 03:11:10.939 align:start position:0%
personal
 
03:11:13.429 --> 03:11:13.439 align:start position:0%
participation of stakeholders like
 
03:11:18.349 --> 03:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
audits conducted by CPA firms
 
03:11:21.110 --> 03:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
for publicly traded companies this is
 
03:11:23.929 --> 03:11:23.939 align:start position:0%
not only is a best practice but it
 
03:11:26.809 --> 03:11:26.819 align:start position:0%
removes any potential concerns for the
 
03:11:28.849 --> 03:11:28.859 align:start position:0%
bias in the audit
 
03:11:30.950 --> 03:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
the audit will be visible to the public
 
03:11:34.070 --> 03:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
where bipartisan participation in the
 
03:11:34.080 --> 03:11:35.389 align:start position:0%
where bipartisan participation in the
volunteerism

03:11:35.389 --> 03:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
volunteerism
 
03:11:37.910 --> 03:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
the audit team will doc will document
 
03:11:41.389 --> 03:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
and identify the process gaps detail
 
03:11:43.429 --> 03:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
areas of vulnerability
 
03:11:45.950 --> 03:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
and Report inconsistencies and results
 
03:11:45.960 --> 03:11:47.510 align:start position:0%
and Report inconsistencies and results
reported

03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
reported
 
03:11:49.730 --> 03:11:49.740 align:start position:0%
they will make recommendations on their
 
03:11:52.849 --> 03:11:52.859 align:start position:0%
findings to be acted upon by legislature
 
03:11:55.070 --> 03:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
this effort will be used to improve
 
03:11:58.730 --> 03:11:58.740 align:start position:0%
election practices and restore voter
 
03:11:58.740 --> 03:12:00.290 align:start position:0%
election practices and restore voter
confidence

03:12:00.290 --> 03:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
confidence
 
03:12:02.990 --> 03:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
we expect funding to come from a
 
03:12:05.510 --> 03:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
combination of appropriations of a
 
03:12:07.550 --> 03:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty thousand dollars from
 
03:12:10.130 --> 03:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
the state with additional funds as
 
03:12:13.190 --> 03:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
donations from the public I respectfully
 
03:12:16.910 --> 03:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to support this bill
 
03:12:18.769 --> 03:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going to take any questions
 
03:12:22.250 --> 03:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
again on this bill I am just the vessel
 
03:12:24.889 --> 03:12:24.899 align:start position:0%

03:12:28.370 --> 03:12:28.380 align:start position:0%

um and I appreciate the second time up
 
03:13:07.849 --> 03:13:07.859 align:start position:0%
to bat here today
 
03:13:09.469 --> 03:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to talk to you about the
 
03:13:13.490 --> 03:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
merits of Bill HB 599 which would
 
03:13:16.610 --> 03:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
introduce the concept of doing an audit
 
03:13:20.090 --> 03:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
on the process that we use for election
 
03:13:22.309 --> 03:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
um as you guys know we are at one of the
 
03:13:25.670 --> 03:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
lower points in voter confidence the
 
03:13:27.349 --> 03:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
numbers reported from the voter
 
03:13:29.450 --> 03:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
confidence committee indicated that
 
03:13:31.849 --> 03:13:31.859 align:start position:0%
about 50 percent of the people who came
 
03:13:34.370 --> 03:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
forward and testified were very
 
03:13:37.670 --> 03:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
concerned and had concerns about the
 
03:13:40.010 --> 03:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
performance of areas of the election
 
03:13:43.070 --> 03:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
process and as we have never had an
 
03:13:45.769 --> 03:13:45.779 align:start position:0%
audit in the state of New Hampshire it
 
03:13:48.530 --> 03:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
is a best practice and would be done on
 
03:13:51.410 --> 03:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
an annual basis if we were a company
 
03:13:54.469 --> 03:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
so I I want to let you guys know that I
 
03:13:56.570 --> 03:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
participated with a whole group of hard
 
03:13:59.929 --> 03:13:59.939 align:start position:0%
work in New Hampshire citizens on a
 
03:14:03.830 --> 03:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
citizen's audit we uh and again if you I
 
03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
gave this a handy um handout for you I'm
 
03:14:08.150 --> 03:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
just going to walk through this as I
 
03:14:10.130 --> 03:14:10.140 align:start position:0%
talk so that it kind of backs up the
 
03:14:10.140 --> 03:14:11.150 align:start position:0%
talk so that it kind of backs up the
points

03:14:11.150 --> 03:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
points
 
03:14:13.490 --> 03:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
so I was a member of this citizens audit
 
03:14:15.710 --> 03:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
we did an audit of the 2020 election and
 
03:14:18.050 --> 03:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
we are in a motion on the midterm
 
03:14:20.450 --> 03:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
election audit ourselves personally but
 
03:14:22.490 --> 03:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
there are certainly limitations to what
 
03:14:26.210 --> 03:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
we can and can't do uh the team uh did
 
03:14:29.630 --> 03:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
over a thousand uh 91a requests we
 
03:14:31.670 --> 03:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
raised a hundred thousand dollars in the
 
03:14:33.050 --> 03:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
course of one week
 
03:14:35.929 --> 03:14:35.939 align:start position:0%
we have 8 000 people who follow us on
 
03:14:38.690 --> 03:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
Facebook and um Telegram
 
03:14:41.450 --> 03:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
we have 400 active volunteers and we've
 
03:14:43.190 --> 03:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
had some help from National expert
 
03:14:45.889 --> 03:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
experts which was wonderful we spent
 
03:14:48.170 --> 03:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of hours on data
 
03:14:50.269 --> 03:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
collection and as you can imagine being
 
03:14:53.570 --> 03:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
a non-indigenous legislative or election
 
03:14:56.269 --> 03:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
official this was new ground for all of
 
03:14:59.510 --> 03:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
us and then we followed it up with over
 
03:15:02.809 --> 03:15:02.819 align:start position:0%
1200 hours of canvassing knocking on
 
03:15:04.610 --> 03:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
doors and just trying to get some
 
03:15:08.570 --> 03:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
feedback on the voter that cast the vote
 
03:15:11.510 --> 03:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
um actually that was registered on the
 
03:15:13.670 --> 03:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
day of the election are they the ones
 
03:15:15.410 --> 03:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
that cast the vote did they vote and so
 
03:15:17.809 --> 03:15:17.819 align:start position:0%
we did that work as well
 
03:15:19.070 --> 03:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
um to start with there were some really
 
03:15:21.710 --> 03:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
weird things that happened in 2020 that
 
03:15:23.870 --> 03:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
um and I say weird because we don't have
 
03:15:25.610 --> 03:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
the facts behind it we just have the
 
03:15:27.050 --> 03:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
indicators and that's why we need the
 
03:15:27.060 --> 03:15:28.010 align:start position:0%
indicators and that's why we need the
audit

03:15:28.010 --> 03:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
audit
 
03:15:31.550 --> 03:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
we saw and the page two you'll see the
 
03:15:33.410 --> 03:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
voter Trends
 
03:15:34.790 --> 03:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
um over time
 
03:15:37.250 --> 03:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
and these are two counties in the state
 
03:15:39.349 --> 03:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and you're going to see
 
03:15:41.690 --> 03:15:41.700 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire over
 
03:15:44.150 --> 03:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
that period of time grew four percent in
 
03:15:44.160 --> 03:15:45.469 align:start position:0%
that period of time grew four percent in
population

03:15:45.469 --> 03:15:45.479 align:start position:0%
population
 
03:15:47.269 --> 03:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
but as you look through the numbers and
 
03:15:48.769 --> 03:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
I know there's a lot of numbers on here
 
03:15:51.769 --> 03:15:51.779 align:start position:0%
you're going to see that the Republican
 
03:15:53.929 --> 03:15:53.939 align:start position:0%
party in Rockingham County
 
03:16:00.170 --> 03:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
uh grew by uh 7.3 percent in 2012 2.9
 
03:16:04.250 --> 03:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
percent in 2016 and then a six percent
 
03:16:07.309 --> 03:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
growth in 2020 but when you look at the
 
03:16:08.870 --> 03:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
Democrat Party there were some really
 
03:16:10.730 --> 03:16:10.740 align:start position:0%
interesting Trends there was a decline
 
03:16:14.690 --> 03:16:14.700 align:start position:0%
of 4.3 and then a growth of 0.2 a
 
03:16:17.809 --> 03:16:17.819 align:start position:0%
negative uh growth of of 0.2 and then
 
03:16:21.530 --> 03:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
there was a 25 growth in Democrat votes
 
03:16:23.450 --> 03:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
in 2020.
 
03:16:26.150 --> 03:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
and so when you have a state that only
 
03:16:28.309 --> 03:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
grew by four percent there's just some
 
03:16:30.349 --> 03:16:30.359 align:start position:0%
dichotomy in the numbers we don't know
 
03:16:32.210 --> 03:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
if this is right wrong or indifferent
 
03:16:34.969 --> 03:16:34.979 align:start position:0%
but we have no way to get to what drove
 
03:16:37.550 --> 03:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
those unusual things to happen and so
 
03:16:39.410 --> 03:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
again just trying to get our arms around
 
03:16:42.110 --> 03:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the state
 
03:16:44.150 --> 03:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
I have on the next page one of the
 
03:16:45.410 --> 03:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
things that we found in the citizens
 
03:16:49.550 --> 03:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
audit machine performance and we did put
 
03:16:51.950 --> 03:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
together a complete machine performance
 
03:16:51.960 --> 03:16:52.550 align:start position:0%
together a complete machine performance
um

03:16:52.550 --> 03:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:55.309 --> 03:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
and that's this page you guys we did put
 
03:16:57.230 --> 03:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
together a complete machine performance
 
03:16:57.240 --> 03:16:58.969 align:start position:0%
together a complete machine performance
report

03:16:58.969 --> 03:16:58.979 align:start position:0%
report
 
03:17:01.130 --> 03:17:01.140 align:start position:0%
and what we did is we collected the
 
03:17:03.950 --> 03:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
machine tapes from every town across New
 
03:17:07.730 --> 03:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we Pareto them by town so
 
03:17:09.550 --> 03:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
that you could see how each machine
 
03:17:12.590 --> 03:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
reported per candidate I did a sample
 
03:17:14.750 --> 03:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
just to show you Merrimack on the
 
03:17:16.730 --> 03:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
presidential and the government governor
 
03:17:20.030 --> 03:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
race what you'll see is across the top
 
03:17:23.150 --> 03:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
the overall distribution of Republicans
 
03:17:26.809 --> 03:17:26.819 align:start position:0%
Independents and Democrats that lived in
 
03:17:29.389 --> 03:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
Merrimack and then when you look at the
 
03:17:31.910 --> 03:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
machines below you'll see that Merrimack
 
03:17:33.769 --> 03:17:33.779 align:start position:0%
had nine machines
 
03:17:35.510 --> 03:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
but there were three machines that
 
03:17:37.969 --> 03:17:37.979 align:start position:0%
performed out of bounds to the overall
 
03:17:40.670 --> 03:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
performance of not only the town
 
03:17:43.610 --> 03:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
composition but the other machines we
 
03:17:45.530 --> 03:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
don't know why that happened but we just
 
03:17:47.750 --> 03:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
know that it's unusual and statistically
 
03:17:50.210 --> 03:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
it's very very improbable
 
03:17:53.330 --> 03:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
so again another flag that said hey
 
03:17:55.130 --> 03:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
maybe we should check this out and have
 
03:17:58.370 --> 03:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
this included as part of an audit
 
03:18:00.889 --> 03:18:00.899 align:start position:0%
on the next slide it just again another
 
03:18:03.230 --> 03:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
driver on a reason that we really would
 
03:18:05.450 --> 03:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
like to see an audit
 
03:18:08.330 --> 03:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
is that on the day that we publish our
 
03:18:11.450 --> 03:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
voter turnout in 2020 we publish to the
 
03:18:13.730 --> 03:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
nation that New Hampshire had
 
03:18:16.849 --> 03:18:16.859 align:start position:0%
experienced a 72.2 percent voter turnout
 
03:18:19.429 --> 03:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 election that was pretty
 
03:18:21.410 --> 03:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
outstanding we were third in the nation
 
03:18:23.269 --> 03:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
with those results
 
03:18:25.190 --> 03:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
but less than
 
03:18:27.530 --> 03:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
um 10 months later 11 months later we
 
03:18:29.990 --> 03:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
did the 10-year Purge of our voter
 
03:18:33.110 --> 03:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
registration and we removed 230
 
03:18:35.389 --> 03:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
000 voters from the New Hampshire voter
 
03:18:35.399 --> 03:18:36.349 align:start position:0%
000 voters from the New Hampshire voter
rolls

03:18:36.349 --> 03:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
rolls
 
03:18:38.929 --> 03:18:38.939 align:start position:0%
when we recast the numbers of what the
 
03:18:40.790 --> 03:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
actual voter turnout for the active
 
03:18:42.830 --> 03:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
voters would have been in the 2020
 
03:18:44.809 --> 03:18:44.819 align:start position:0%
election New Hampshire would have
 
03:18:48.469 --> 03:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
experienced a 92.5 percent voter turnout
 
03:18:51.490 --> 03:18:51.500 align:start position:0%
with the recast cleaned up registration
 
03:18:55.849 --> 03:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
that is a statistical anomaly and if you
 
03:18:57.710 --> 03:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
can see that we would have jumped to the
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
number one position and exceeded it by
 
03:19:02.990 --> 03:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
nearly 20 points so something is just
 
03:19:06.110 --> 03:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:07.910 --> 03:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
and finally just to touch a little bit
 
03:19:09.349 --> 03:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
on our canvas
 
03:19:12.170 --> 03:19:12.180 align:start position:0%
when we canvassed we actually found that
 
03:19:14.150 --> 03:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
there were over 9 000 people on our
 
03:19:16.389 --> 03:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
voter that voted in the 2020 election
 
03:19:20.030 --> 03:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
who had submitted requests for permanent
 
03:19:23.450 --> 03:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
move of address from their uh the
 
03:19:25.849 --> 03:19:25.859 align:start position:0%
address that they voted from again we
 
03:19:28.309 --> 03:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
don't know if those folks are are com
 
03:19:30.050 --> 03:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
currently domiciled in New Hampshire
 
03:19:32.170 --> 03:19:32.180 align:start position:0%
whether they um
 
03:19:35.389 --> 03:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
they decided to stay at that address
 
03:19:37.730 --> 03:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
after they formally changed their
 
03:19:40.190 --> 03:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
address but we do know that it's
 
03:19:42.230 --> 03:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
unlikely that all nine thousand of those
 
03:19:45.170 --> 03:19:45.180 align:start position:0%
folks still reside in New Hampshire and
 
03:19:47.750 --> 03:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
had a vote cast in their names
 
03:19:50.090 --> 03:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
for the midterms we use the same
 
03:19:52.910 --> 03:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
strategy we use the active voter
 
03:19:52.920 --> 03:19:54.050 align:start position:0%
strategy we use the active voter
registration

03:19:54.050 --> 03:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
registration
 
03:19:56.269 --> 03:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
and we bounced it against
 
03:20:00.110 --> 03:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
um the USPS permanent move database of
 
03:20:01.910 --> 03:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
people who had moved over the prior two
 
03:20:04.070 --> 03:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
years and what we found is that there
 
03:20:07.130 --> 03:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
were 64 000 people who remained on the
 
03:20:09.410 --> 03:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire voter registration who had
 
03:20:12.469 --> 03:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
moved out of County or out of state and
 
03:20:15.290 --> 03:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
they had not been removed
 
03:20:17.090 --> 03:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
so these are some of the leading
 
03:20:19.309 --> 03:20:19.319 align:start position:0%
indicators that lead us to believe that
 
03:20:21.650 --> 03:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
we've got some gaps in the way that we
 
03:20:23.150 --> 03:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
do our elections
 
03:20:25.190 --> 03:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
and we're really anxious to actually
 
03:20:27.889 --> 03:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
take an opportunity to dive deep into
 
03:20:30.530 --> 03:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
our elections do this audit with an
 
03:20:33.110 --> 03:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
impartial third party and then take the
 
03:20:35.570 --> 03:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
results and learn from them
 
03:20:37.130 --> 03:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
I mean we can't correct what we don't
 
03:20:40.370 --> 03:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
know and if you've ever been a party of
 
03:20:41.990 --> 03:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
somebody who's been in Alcoholics
 
03:20:44.630 --> 03:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
Anonymous that's truly their their motto
 
03:20:47.450 --> 03:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
you can't fix what you don't acknowledge
 
03:20:49.309 --> 03:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
and we need to get to the bottom of how
 
03:20:51.050 --> 03:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
things are going to build up voter
 
03:20:53.450 --> 03:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
confidence and to improve our our
 
03:20:54.710 --> 03:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
process here
 
03:20:57.650 --> 03:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
and just on another note
 
03:21:00.190 --> 03:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
um again my role in in Corporate America
 
03:21:03.710 --> 03:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
I again did a lot of business controls
 
03:21:06.590 --> 03:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
and it was a standard practice that we
 
03:21:08.929 --> 03:21:08.939 align:start position:0%
would audit our business every single
 
03:21:11.809 --> 03:21:11.819 align:start position:0%
year using a third party you are not
 
03:21:13.790 --> 03:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to trade on the New York Stock
 
03:21:16.130 --> 03:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
Exchange if you did not have a
 
03:21:18.530 --> 03:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
foundational audit to confirm that your
 
03:21:21.469 --> 03:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
results were accurate because people are
 
03:21:23.690 --> 03:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
investing their hard-earned money into
 
03:21:26.690 --> 03:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
the the health of that company
 
03:21:29.330 --> 03:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
and so we are asking the people of New
 
03:21:31.849 --> 03:21:31.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to invest and believe into our
 
03:21:33.830 --> 03:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
election process and we owe them an
 
03:21:36.230 --> 03:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
audit so thank you very much and I'd be
 
03:21:39.050 --> 03:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
glad to answer any questions around the
 
03:21:43.490 --> 03:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:44.570 --> 03:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:21:46.610 --> 03:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
representative wood
 
03:21:49.969 --> 03:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh and thank you for
 
03:21:52.429 --> 03:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh looking at the
 
03:21:54.969 --> 03:21:54.979 align:start position:0%
data here that you provide most of it is
 
03:21:58.490 --> 03:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
manipulation long word uh recalculation
 
03:22:00.230 --> 03:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
of data that you found
 
03:22:03.769 --> 03:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
in the 1200 hours door knocking
 
03:22:05.990 --> 03:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
what type of feedback did you get from
 
03:22:08.269 --> 03:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
actually actual people what type of
 
03:22:11.210 --> 03:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
things concerned you from that as far as
 
03:22:13.429 --> 03:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
so we're not talking about you
 
03:22:15.950 --> 03:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
surprising that a 92 percent number is
 
03:22:17.269 --> 03:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
too big
 
03:22:20.570 --> 03:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
actual fact sure so we we canvassed
 
03:22:23.450 --> 03:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
Waterville in Rye and
 
03:22:26.630 --> 03:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
um roughly 13 of the people that we
 
03:22:29.330 --> 03:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
queried had either not voted in the
 
03:22:31.969 --> 03:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
election or it was the prior owner that
 
03:22:35.210 --> 03:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
lived at that home or they said that
 
03:22:37.250 --> 03:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
they voted in person but they were
 
03:22:39.889 --> 03:22:39.899 align:start position:0%
logged as an absentee ballot or we did
 
03:22:41.990 --> 03:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
have an instance where an address didn't
 
03:22:45.170 --> 03:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
exist we had found like the lease office
 
03:22:48.410 --> 03:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
in Waterville had a vote cast from it so
 
03:22:51.710 --> 03:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
we had those kind of issues found
 
03:22:54.170 --> 03:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
that's what drove the focus in our
 
03:22:56.570 --> 03:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
online canvas work because the repeat
 
03:22:58.670 --> 03:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
issue that we found is when we knocked
 
03:23:01.550 --> 03:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
on doors and we spoke to the voter we
 
03:23:03.349 --> 03:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
would have two last names and so we'd
 
03:23:05.389 --> 03:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
say Hey you know we've got Bob Smith
 
03:23:07.790 --> 03:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
voted from this house in yard George
 
03:23:07.800 --> 03:23:09.050 align:start position:0%
voted from this house in yard George
Jones

03:23:09.050 --> 03:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
Jones
 
03:23:11.150 --> 03:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
um did Bob vote does Bob live here and
 
03:23:13.010 --> 03:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
they said oh no I bought the house from
 
03:23:15.469 --> 03:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
him you know two years ago
 
03:23:18.469 --> 03:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
and so we had this situation that led us
 
03:23:19.849 --> 03:23:19.859 align:start position:0%
to believe that we had a gap in our
 
03:23:22.370 --> 03:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
process that prior owners or people that
 
03:23:25.250 --> 03:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
were moving might still be voting and I
 
03:23:27.050 --> 03:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
know in New Hampshire there's a tad of a
 
03:23:29.750 --> 03:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
gray area of is that your domicile or
 
03:23:33.469 --> 03:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
not but the but the uh volume that we
 
03:23:34.849 --> 03:23:34.859 align:start position:0%
found and we just left the Attorney
 
03:23:37.309 --> 03:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
General's office and although we
 
03:23:38.929 --> 03:23:38.939 align:start position:0%
provided this information to the
 
03:23:41.809 --> 03:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
confidence committee we left them we've
 
03:23:43.670 --> 03:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
we've got about 900 but I left him with
 
03:23:47.030 --> 03:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
about 700 cases where we documented the
 
03:23:50.030 --> 03:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
home was sold from one family to another
 
03:23:50.040 --> 03:23:51.849 align:start position:0%
home was sold from one family to another
family

03:23:51.849 --> 03:23:51.859 align:start position:0%
family
 
03:23:54.469 --> 03:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
months or a couple years before the
 
03:23:57.050 --> 03:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
election in both parties both families
 
03:24:00.110 --> 03:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
voted in the election so there is a gap
 
03:24:03.110 --> 03:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's been created in the process
 
03:24:05.929 --> 03:24:05.939 align:start position:0%
there's a check follow-up follow-up
 
03:24:08.510 --> 03:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
um so 700
 
03:24:10.790 --> 03:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
that can't be the 1200 that you're not
 
03:24:12.469 --> 03:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
or that might have must have been
 
03:24:15.889 --> 03:24:15.899 align:start position:0%
another survey you did yes but let me go
 
03:24:17.809 --> 03:24:17.819 align:start position:0%
back to what you said you found some
 
03:24:20.150 --> 03:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
anomaly so out of the 1200 how many
 
03:24:23.030 --> 03:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
anomalies do you have a number yeah we
 
03:24:27.050 --> 03:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
found approximately 80 that 80 80 uh of
 
03:24:29.809 --> 03:24:29.819 align:start position:0%
the doors that were opened so it kind of
 
03:24:32.990 --> 03:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
goes like this you knock on 600 doors
 
03:24:37.070 --> 03:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
and maybe 500 or 400 answer and then you
 
03:24:39.050 --> 03:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
end up with people that can give you
 
03:24:40.969 --> 03:24:40.979 align:start position:0%
some direction on their voting that
 
03:24:42.650 --> 03:24:42.660 align:start position:0%
leads you to know that there's a problem
 
03:24:45.650 --> 03:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
okay so the 80 is not really out of 1200
 
03:24:47.929 --> 03:24:47.939 align:start position:0%
because I swallowed it so the 1200 are
 
03:24:50.389 --> 03:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
the hours that we saw so it takes a lot
 
03:24:53.929 --> 03:24:53.939 align:start position:0%
of time a feed on the street so we did
 
03:24:56.510 --> 03:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
do two towns with a team of canvassers
 
03:24:59.510 --> 03:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
and um that's what led us to the further
 
03:24:59.520 --> 03:25:00.590 align:start position:0%
and um that's what led us to the further
work

03:25:00.590 --> 03:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:25:02.269 --> 03:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
one more question
 
03:25:04.010 --> 03:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair if you don't mind follow-up
 
03:25:07.309 --> 03:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
sorry uh I read that wrong sorry so what
 
03:25:08.750 --> 03:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
I guess the word I was looking at
 
03:25:11.090 --> 03:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
percentage what percentage of anomalies
 
03:25:12.590 --> 03:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
did you find when the people answered
 
03:25:13.729 --> 03:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
and went through all right it was
 
03:25:16.250 --> 03:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
roughly 13 of the people who answered
 
03:25:19.910 --> 03:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you sorry representative Bay
 
03:25:22.190 --> 03:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:25:23.990 --> 03:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:25:26.809 --> 03:25:26.819 align:start position:0%
um on the bill uh there's a reference to
 
03:25:30.590 --> 03:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh technical lead who's being hired uh
 
03:25:32.630 --> 03:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
can you speak to the background of that
 
03:25:34.490 --> 03:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
technical lead in terms of uh
 
03:25:36.710 --> 03:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
qualification and experience
 
03:25:41.870 --> 03:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
so um from my my narrow com uh direction
 
03:25:43.969 --> 03:25:43.979 align:start position:0%
of what a technical lead would be it
 
03:25:45.170 --> 03:25:45.180 align:start position:0%
would be somebody who has enough
 
03:25:48.110 --> 03:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the election process enough
 
03:25:50.269 --> 03:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
knowledge of how to
 
03:25:52.250 --> 03:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
um be able to separate roles
 
03:25:54.050 --> 03:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to make sure there's no
 
03:25:57.290 --> 03:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
conflict and kind of like a CPA but
 
03:25:58.370 --> 03:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
there would also be a technical
 
03:26:00.349 --> 03:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
component for somebody who understands
 
03:26:03.050 --> 03:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
you know I.T related issues so that they
 
03:26:04.790 --> 03:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
could understand if there's a
 
03:26:08.870 --> 03:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
vulnerability in our voting machines
 
03:26:11.030 --> 03:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
03:26:14.090 --> 03:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
so um for that person would you make it
 
03:26:17.090 --> 03:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
a necessary qualification that this
 
03:26:20.690 --> 03:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
person has worked in an election
 
03:26:23.349 --> 03:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
I or disqualification
 
03:26:26.389 --> 03:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
well I you know obviously they would
 
03:26:28.490 --> 03:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
have to have a some election history to
 
03:26:30.349 --> 03:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
be able to understand the voting
 
03:26:33.349 --> 03:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
machines and how elections work
 
03:26:35.330 --> 03:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
um and I again I think we leave the
 
03:26:37.670 --> 03:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
definition of the who the right
 
03:26:39.590 --> 03:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
technical expert would be to the the
 
03:26:42.229 --> 03:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
people that have to hire that person
 
03:26:43.370 --> 03:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
um because I want them to be able to
 
03:26:45.290 --> 03:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
weigh in since they've got to manage
 
03:26:46.790 --> 03:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
this process and they have to have
 
03:26:48.590 --> 03:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
somebody who can guide them
 
03:26:50.510 --> 03:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
and so for me if I were on the committee
 
03:26:52.370 --> 03:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
I'd want somebody I could ask good
 
03:26:54.950 --> 03:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
questions to who could guide us on how
 
03:26:57.290 --> 03:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
we were commencing the audit process
 
03:26:58.910 --> 03:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
03:27:00.309 --> 03:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:27:02.330 --> 03:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
03:27:04.490 --> 03:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh and thank you for
 
03:27:07.070 --> 03:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
coming today I I want to ask about the
 
03:27:10.910 --> 03:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
sum of 150 000 uh and how that number
 
03:27:12.530 --> 03:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
03:27:14.630 --> 03:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
kind of decided
 
03:27:17.809 --> 03:27:17.819 align:start position:0%
well we we determined that hiring
 
03:27:20.330 --> 03:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
somebody to be able to conduct the audit
 
03:27:23.030 --> 03:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
a professional that we would be paying a
 
03:27:26.150 --> 03:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
chunk of that for that professional and
 
03:27:28.010 --> 03:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
then beyond that it was just a budgetary
 
03:27:31.130 --> 03:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
number and as I included in my
 
03:27:34.910 --> 03:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
um overview we were successful at being
 
03:27:37.370 --> 03:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
able to do fundraising from the citizens
 
03:27:38.330 --> 03:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire because they're
 
03:27:40.790 --> 03:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
passionate about this issue and if we're
 
03:27:42.710 --> 03:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
asking you to do something I think it's
 
03:27:44.450 --> 03:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
it's really good that we would put our
 
03:27:46.010 --> 03:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
money where our mouth was and
 
03:27:48.050 --> 03:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
participate so we thought that that
 
03:27:50.389 --> 03:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
funding from the state with fundraising
 
03:27:53.870 --> 03:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
from the population would be a great way
 
03:27:58.130 --> 03:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
to partner and have this work done
 
03:28:00.170 --> 03:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:28:02.990 --> 03:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative um representative where
 
03:28:04.130 --> 03:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
do you have a question
 
03:28:05.510 --> 03:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative will come back to you
 
03:28:06.650 --> 03:28:06.660 align:start position:0%
because you've already asked we're going
 
03:28:09.170 --> 03:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
to representative Weir first
 
03:28:11.630 --> 03:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
03:28:14.150 --> 03:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and um
 
03:28:15.590 --> 03:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
Miss Town
 
03:28:15.600 --> 03:28:16.550 align:start position:0%
Miss Town
um

03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:19.910 --> 03:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
on the Merrimack uh slide does that are
 
03:28:22.969 --> 03:28:22.979 align:start position:0%
different Awards represented there or do
 
03:28:24.650 --> 03:28:24.660 align:start position:0%
you know if the machines came from
 
03:28:27.830 --> 03:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
different areas or sections of the town
 
03:28:30.650 --> 03:28:30.660 align:start position:0%
I believe there's two machines in each
 
03:28:33.050 --> 03:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
location and that they are representing
 
03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
different locations within Merrimack I'm
 
03:28:37.969 --> 03:28:37.979 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding
 
03:28:40.130 --> 03:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
but there was no one of the things that
 
03:28:42.170 --> 03:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
I wanted to be clear is if you look at
 
03:28:43.790 --> 03:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
that slide
 
03:28:45.650 --> 03:28:45.660 align:start position:0%
um we when we did do our reporting and
 
03:28:47.990 --> 03:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
it is available for every town so it's a
 
03:28:49.610 --> 03:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
pretty fascinating report and I'll be
 
03:28:52.250 --> 03:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
glad to get it to the committee but
 
03:28:55.790 --> 03:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
you'll see that we did across the top is
 
03:28:58.610 --> 03:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
a breakdown of uh that the party
 
03:29:02.630 --> 03:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
affiliation of the mail-in ballots by
 
03:29:04.670 --> 03:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
Democrat versus Republican versus
 
03:29:07.610 --> 03:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
independent is the same as the people
 
03:29:09.130 --> 03:29:09.140 align:start position:0%
who voted in person
 
03:29:13.250 --> 03:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
and none of these machines were specific
 
03:29:16.790 --> 03:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
to an in-person or an absentee ballot
 
03:29:19.729 --> 03:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
processing they the ballots for both
 
03:29:22.309 --> 03:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
parties were processed on both machines
 
03:29:24.290 --> 03:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
at the locations or across all these
 
03:29:26.450 --> 03:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
machines they weren't isolated like they
 
03:29:29.870 --> 03:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
didn't put all absentees through machine
 
03:29:34.250 --> 03:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
three six and nine so again just a it
 
03:29:36.050 --> 03:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
was a flag to us as we were doing our
 
03:29:38.210 --> 03:29:38.220 align:start position:0%
audit and it's just worthy of following
 
03:29:40.670 --> 03:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
up and as I'll get that the full report
 
03:29:42.769 --> 03:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
out to the committee but you'll see that
 
03:29:44.210 --> 03:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
this isn't an isolated thing in
 
03:29:47.030 --> 03:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
Merrimack that you'll find that across
 
03:29:49.550 --> 03:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
the state we have machines that are
 
03:29:52.130 --> 03:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
performing outside the bounds of the
 
03:29:54.889 --> 03:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
overall affiliation of the parties
 
03:29:57.110 --> 03:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
within the towns
 
03:30:00.290 --> 03:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
follow up uh follow-up yeah so you state
 
03:30:02.269 --> 03:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
that that's statistically improbable do
 
03:30:05.870 --> 03:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
you have a estimate of I mean it what is
 
03:30:09.429 --> 03:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
the odds that three machines would be so
 
03:30:12.590 --> 03:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
highly selective toward one candidate
 
03:30:15.590 --> 03:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
versus the averages that seem to appear
 
03:30:17.690 --> 03:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
in the other machines well the the best
 
03:30:20.110 --> 03:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
way I can answer is there is a a
 
03:30:23.450 --> 03:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
documentary called hacking democracy and
 
03:30:26.450 --> 03:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
they ran this analysis down in Georgia
 
03:30:29.809 --> 03:30:29.819 align:start position:0%
when there was a suspicion that one of
 
03:30:32.990 --> 03:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
the democratic candidates had been lost
 
03:30:34.969 --> 03:30:34.979 align:start position:0%
a race because of machine manipulation
 
03:30:37.750 --> 03:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
and they conducted this same exercise
 
03:30:41.090 --> 03:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
and they said that this type of result
 
03:30:44.349 --> 03:30:44.359 align:start position:0%
is one in a million that this would not
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
statistically happen so I'm not a
 
03:30:49.429 --> 03:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
statistician but I can tell you that
 
03:30:52.070 --> 03:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
that is that that particular guidance
 
03:30:54.349 --> 03:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
when we did this machine tape analysis
 
03:30:56.330 --> 03:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
was something that we took to heart and
 
03:30:57.950 --> 03:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's why I wanted to demonstrate we
 
03:31:00.229 --> 03:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
did have machines performing out of
 
03:31:02.570 --> 03:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
bounds to what you would expect and I
 
03:31:03.830 --> 03:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
just think even if you're not a
 
03:31:06.290 --> 03:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
statistician and you look at the way
 
03:31:08.630 --> 03:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
that the distribution of voter history
 
03:31:11.750 --> 03:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
is and how people are registered and
 
03:31:13.010 --> 03:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
then you look at how the machines are
 
03:31:15.830 --> 03:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
performed it does raise just a normal
 
03:31:17.510 --> 03:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
person's questions of how could that
 
03:31:17.520 --> 03:31:19.490 align:start position:0%
person's questions of how could that
happen

03:31:19.490 --> 03:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
happen
 
03:31:21.110 --> 03:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:31:23.510 --> 03:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bay
 
03:31:26.389 --> 03:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:31:28.190 --> 03:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
um on the
 
03:31:30.590 --> 03:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
um third party audit company can you
 
03:31:32.450 --> 03:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
enlighten me on that I'm not familiar uh
 
03:31:34.370 --> 03:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
with this so what type of company is
 
03:31:36.349 --> 03:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
this is this something that's in state
 
03:31:38.630 --> 03:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
out of state what's in their resume have
 
03:31:41.030 --> 03:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
they done it uh in other states or do
 
03:31:43.490 --> 03:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
you have a specific company in mind I I
 
03:31:45.290 --> 03:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
have no company in mind
 
03:31:48.530 --> 03:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
um I in my background I would normally
 
03:31:51.110 --> 03:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
recommend that you would use like a CPA
 
03:31:54.530 --> 03:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
firm with a technical lead who has an
 
03:31:56.389 --> 03:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
experience in the technology and
 
03:31:59.150 --> 03:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
elections and used them in concert one's
 
03:32:01.190 --> 03:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
going to be very methodical and
 
03:32:04.250 --> 03:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
evaluating uh process you know how is
 
03:32:06.290 --> 03:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
the process working yeah are there
 
03:32:08.570 --> 03:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
issues have we not been following the
 
03:32:11.210 --> 03:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
process is there an exposure that's kind
 
03:32:14.510 --> 03:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
of the brain of a CPA type of firm and
 
03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
then the technologist who gives us kind
 
03:32:19.490 --> 03:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
of the view of how the machines perform
 
03:32:22.010 --> 03:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
and where the vulnerabilities they could
 
03:32:24.110 --> 03:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
kind of weigh into are there exposures
 
03:32:25.550 --> 03:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
there and are there things that we as a
 
03:32:28.130 --> 03:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
date should be doing differently to
 
03:32:30.410 --> 03:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
protect the vote
 
03:32:30.420 --> 03:32:31.729 align:start position:0%
protect the vote
follow-up

03:32:31.729 --> 03:32:31.739 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:32:35.750 --> 03:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
so there is no uh type of company in
 
03:32:37.910 --> 03:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
existence in the United States that
 
03:32:40.910 --> 03:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
specifically does election audits I mean
 
03:32:42.170 --> 03:32:42.180 align:start position:0%
there have been
 
03:32:43.849 --> 03:32:43.859 align:start position:0%
um teams that have done audits in other
 
03:32:43.859 --> 03:32:44.990 align:start position:0%
um teams that have done audits in other
states

03:32:44.990 --> 03:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:32:47.269 --> 03:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
but I didn't want to be prescriptive I
 
03:32:48.710 --> 03:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
wanted New Hampshire to be able to find
 
03:32:51.590 --> 03:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
that right partner we're using
 
03:32:54.410 --> 03:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
um we're using machines that are you
 
03:32:56.630 --> 03:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
know a couple decades old
 
03:32:59.630 --> 03:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
um in our process is very dispersed
 
03:33:01.870 --> 03:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
across towns as opposed to centralized
 
03:33:04.550 --> 03:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
so I think that we're a bit of a unique
 
03:33:06.889 --> 03:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
situation so we should be able to
 
03:33:10.070 --> 03:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
customize the audit approach that makes
 
03:33:11.750 --> 03:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
the most sense for the way that we do
 
03:33:13.370 --> 03:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
our elections
 
03:33:13.380 --> 03:33:14.570 align:start position:0%
our elections
okay

03:33:14.570 --> 03:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:33:16.490 --> 03:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
03:33:18.290 --> 03:33:18.300 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you thank you very
 
03:33:20.570 --> 03:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
much I really appreciate your time next
 
03:33:23.090 --> 03:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
up is Deb Rory
 
03:33:26.030 --> 03:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
how do you um what what town are you
 
03:33:26.040 --> 03:33:27.229 align:start position:0%
how do you um what what town are you
from

03:33:27.229 --> 03:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:33:29.150 --> 03:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
you from Manchester I think there's a
 
03:33:39.410 --> 03:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:41.389 --> 03:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Vice chair and committee for
 
03:33:44.150 --> 03:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
letting me speak on this bill I just
 
03:33:46.130 --> 03:33:46.140 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that I'm in favor of this
 
03:33:48.110 --> 03:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
bill because I believe it would be
 
03:33:50.269 --> 03:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
instrumental in improving voter
 
03:33:50.279 --> 03:33:51.410 align:start position:0%
instrumental in improving voter
confidence

03:33:51.410 --> 03:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
confidence
 
03:33:53.870 --> 03:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
um within the citizens of the state
 
03:33:56.090 --> 03:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
although we're not technically a
 
03:33:58.370 --> 03:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
business we do pay taxes and all of us
 
03:34:00.170 --> 03:34:00.180 align:start position:0%
have an interest in how and where our
 
03:34:03.290 --> 03:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
money is spent and our elections are
 
03:34:05.809 --> 03:34:05.819 align:start position:0%
very valuable to each one of us and
 
03:34:09.050 --> 03:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
where there are holes in the system like
 
03:34:10.849 --> 03:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
I spoke to earlier about the absentee
 
03:34:12.889 --> 03:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
ballot reconciliation
 
03:34:15.110 --> 03:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
um lack of that process
 
03:34:17.630 --> 03:34:17.640 align:start position:0%
I believe that having this type of an
 
03:34:19.550 --> 03:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
audit would um
 
03:34:21.530 --> 03:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
would improve our confidence and would
 
03:34:23.750 --> 03:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
allow us to just see where improvements
 
03:34:26.269 --> 03:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
need to be made like Brenda mentioned
 
03:34:28.910 --> 03:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
that businesses do collect do conduct
 
03:34:30.410 --> 03:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
Audits and although we're not like
 
03:34:33.290 --> 03:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
technically a business and each town is
 
03:34:35.870 --> 03:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for their own elections
 
03:34:35.880 --> 03:34:36.710 align:start position:0%
responsible for their own elections
um

03:34:36.710 --> 03:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:38.750 --> 03:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
we do need to make sure that things are
 
03:34:41.150 --> 03:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
running smoothly and the only way that I
 
03:34:43.490 --> 03:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
can think of to do it is to
 
03:34:43.500 --> 03:34:44.330 align:start position:0%
can think of to do it is to
um

03:34:44.330 --> 03:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:46.910 --> 03:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
ask for your support of this bill and
 
03:34:49.670 --> 03:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
give We the People the opportunity to
 
03:34:53.570 --> 03:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
just see where um there are things that
 
03:34:55.790 --> 03:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
need to be improved and if everything
 
03:34:58.670 --> 03:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
comes out fine then great but from what
 
03:35:01.250 --> 03:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
I've observed personally there are areas
 
03:35:03.050 --> 03:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
for improvement and not to say again
 
03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
that anyone's doing anything wrong but
 
03:35:08.750 --> 03:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's just you know a bipartisan way of
 
03:35:10.550 --> 03:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
increasing our confidence because we'll
 
03:35:13.250 --> 03:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
be able to see an actual report of you

03:36:05.990 --> 03:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
my name is Al brendano I'm from
 
03:36:08.330 --> 03:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
Kensington New Hampshire
 
03:36:09.950 --> 03:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
um I have been
 
03:36:11.990 --> 03:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
um really kind of honored to be part of
 
03:36:14.990 --> 03:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
a volunteer group of uh to work with
 
03:36:17.269 --> 03:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
Brenda and Deb and a whole bunch of
 
03:36:19.309 --> 03:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
other people through the voter
 
03:36:21.170 --> 03:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
conference committee and working with
 
03:36:23.650 --> 03:36:23.660 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state and his assistant
 
03:36:26.590 --> 03:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
it's been a rewarding experience
 
03:36:29.450 --> 03:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to start out I rise in
 
03:36:32.870 --> 03:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
support of the house bill 599
 
03:36:34.910 --> 03:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
first why am I here
 
03:36:37.429 --> 03:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution Article 8
 
03:36:39.950 --> 03:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
instructs the citizens
 
03:36:42.170 --> 03:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
of the accountability of its magistrates
 
03:36:43.429 --> 03:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
and offices
 
03:36:46.610 --> 03:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
Public's right to know article 38 is
 
03:36:50.809 --> 03:36:50.819 align:start position:0%
social virtues and in calculated the
 
03:36:52.969 --> 03:36:52.979 align:start position:0%
right of the citizens to require their
 
03:36:56.330 --> 03:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
law gives and magistrates and exact and
 
03:36:59.150 --> 03:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
constant observers observance of them
 
03:37:03.769 --> 03:37:03.779 align:start position:0%
and the formation and execution of laws
 
03:37:08.630 --> 03:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:11.210 --> 03:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
because I believe sadly that this
 
03:37:13.849 --> 03:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
committee uh did not get the consent of
 
03:37:14.870 --> 03:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
the people
 
03:37:18.229 --> 03:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh in their constitutional duties
 
03:37:21.849 --> 03:37:21.859 align:start position:0%
and I'll point to two specific uh points
 
03:37:23.710 --> 03:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
one is
 
03:37:28.090 --> 03:37:28.100 align:start position:0%
almost 30 years ago codified an RSA
 
03:37:33.490 --> 03:37:33.500 align:start position:0%
65640 uh you approved on a trial basis
 
03:37:35.450 --> 03:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
voting machines
 
03:37:37.429 --> 03:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
those were never constitutionally
 
03:37:37.439 --> 03:37:39.170 align:start position:0%
those were never constitutionally
adopted

03:37:39.170 --> 03:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
03:37:42.830 --> 03:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
secondly we have an increase in really
 
03:37:44.710 --> 03:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
repugnant and
 
03:37:47.929 --> 03:37:47.939 align:start position:0%
expansion of absentee ballots that once
 
03:37:51.349 --> 03:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
again Falls outside your purview and
 
03:37:52.969 --> 03:37:52.979 align:start position:0%
should have gone to the consent of the
 
03:37:52.979 --> 03:37:54.830 align:start position:0%
should have gone to the consent of the
voters

03:37:54.830 --> 03:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
voters
 
03:37:57.469 --> 03:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
many of us today who testify before your
 
03:37:57.479 --> 03:37:58.490 align:start position:0%
many of us today who testify before your
committee

03:37:58.490 --> 03:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:38:01.610 --> 03:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
worked with the voter confidence group
 
03:38:04.130 --> 03:38:04.140 align:start position:0%
our experience and transparency and
 
03:38:06.710 --> 03:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
fairness many of us spent thousands of
 
03:38:09.290 --> 03:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
hours of personal time and money to be
 
03:38:11.510 --> 03:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
part of a solution
 
03:38:14.389 --> 03:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
what what may not be transparent to your
 
03:38:14.399 --> 03:38:15.410 align:start position:0%
what what may not be transparent to your
committee

03:38:15.410 --> 03:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:38:20.150 --> 03:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
after review of that document was that
 
03:38:22.429 --> 03:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
the public testimony and evidence that
 
03:38:26.210 --> 03:38:26.220 align:start position:0%
was produced was not given out you may
 
03:38:28.250 --> 03:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
have not seen it in the voter confidence
 
03:38:31.729 --> 03:38:31.739 align:start position:0%
uh committee report I'll ask you to look
 
03:38:34.070 --> 03:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
at that because a lot of us produced
 
03:38:36.769 --> 03:38:36.779 align:start position:0%
evidence and that committee's position
 
03:38:38.750 --> 03:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
was that we're not accepting evidence
 
03:38:41.330 --> 03:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
we're just looking at confidence but if
 
03:38:43.490 --> 03:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
you dig deeper in there you'll find it
 
03:38:46.550 --> 03:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
one service the second one is the
 
03:38:48.530 --> 03:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
service of a remonstrance and letter of
 
03:38:51.229 --> 03:38:51.239 align:start position:0%
trespass this is very important we serve
 
03:38:53.090 --> 03:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State the Department of
 
03:38:55.610 --> 03:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
Justice for the unconstitutional use of
 
03:38:59.330 --> 03:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
machines on March 1st 2022 and we're
 
03:39:03.469 --> 03:39:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:03.479 --> 03:39:04.790 align:start position:0%
 
third

03:39:04.790 --> 03:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
third
 
03:39:07.070 --> 03:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
a statement of blind trust if you look
 
03:39:09.290 --> 03:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
at the report number l
 
03:39:11.990 --> 03:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
that machines were used correctly and
 
03:39:15.110 --> 03:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
more accurate than hand count lacks any
 
03:39:18.950 --> 03:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
empirical data peer review or basis of
 
03:39:21.349 --> 03:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
fact to Stage such claims
 
03:39:23.330 --> 03:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
if they're going to State a claim in
 
03:39:24.830 --> 03:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
that report they really should stand
 
03:39:25.969 --> 03:39:25.979 align:start position:0%
behind it
 
03:39:27.889 --> 03:39:27.899 align:start position:0%
nearly 30 percent of towns in New
 
03:39:30.229 --> 03:39:30.239 align:start position:0%

03:39:32.389 --> 03:39:32.399 align:start position:0%

03:39:40.550 --> 03:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
voting policy and procedure changes
 
03:39:43.729 --> 03:39:43.739 align:start position:0%
supported by evidence presented as well
 
03:39:45.650 --> 03:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
as critical components that would help
 
03:39:48.290 --> 03:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
prevent future unlawful Acts or
 
03:39:50.929 --> 03:39:50.939 align:start position:0%

03:39:57.710 --> 03:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
election election officials
 
03:39:59.929 --> 03:39:59.939 align:start position:0%

that's from the Secretary of State's

they were directed to cut modems the

wires of the modem inside the machine
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%

as a result of a security update they
 
03:41:22.729 --> 03:41:22.739 align:start position:0%
made the machines lose their UL

witness Wayne P Sayer and all this
 
03:41:36.590 --> 03:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
everything I'm telling you is backed up
 
03:41:39.469 --> 03:41:39.479 align:start position:0%
in the information that I gave you
 
03:41:42.349 --> 03:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
seventh the accuvote machine maintenance
 
03:41:46.190 --> 03:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
in towns is accomplished with no record

of State's office there is no chain of

custody we don't know when somebody does
 
03:42:06.830 --> 03:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance on the machine if those
 
03:42:09.110 --> 03:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
parts even meet any certification
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%

and last in the 2020 recount
 
03:42:24.769 --> 03:42:24.779 align:start position:0%
uh just recently in District 24 we
 
03:42:26.870 --> 03:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
worked a bunch of us work that and
 
03:42:30.769 --> 03:42:30.779 align:start position:0%
expose an inexcusable listing of ballot
 
03:42:33.050 --> 03:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
chain of custody and witness and box
 
03:42:36.229 --> 03:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
failures which may I say may have
 
03:42:37.969 --> 03:42:37.979 align:start position:0%
affected an election that's still under
 
03:42:37.979 --> 03:42:40.190 align:start position:0%
affected an election that's still under
review

03:42:40.190 --> 03:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
review
 
03:42:42.769 --> 03:42:42.779 align:start position:0%
torn boxes need to be replaced with
 
03:42:45.010 --> 03:42:45.020 align:start position:0%
tamper-proof bins
 
03:42:47.450 --> 03:42:47.460 align:start position:0%

03:42:53.630 --> 03:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
the legitimacy and constitutionality of

the expansion of the absentee ballot
 
03:42:55.500 --> 03:42:56.630 align:start position:0%
the expansion of the absentee ballot

process
 
03:43:00.050 --> 03:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
I hope you'll support that process in
 
03:43:00.060 --> 03:43:00.889 align:start position:0%
I hope you'll support that process in

03:43:00.889 --> 03:43:00.899 align:start position:0%

members of this committee I ask you will
 
03:43:13.490 --> 03:43:13.500 align:start position:0%

will you lead with the mindset to
 
03:43:22.190 --> 03:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
placing a value of our votes as we do
 
03:43:23.690 --> 03:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
our personal money
 
03:43:26.630 --> 03:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
will you lead with utilizing the best

03:43:33.290 --> 03:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's website claims
 
03:43:36.710 --> 03:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the easiest place for
 
03:43:40.010 --> 03:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
voters to register and cast their votes
 
03:43:42.469 --> 03:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
but do we not make us why do we not make
 
03:43:46.010 --> 03:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
a statement it's the securist also
 
03:43:47.929 --> 03:43:47.939 align:start position:0%
then the people of New Hampshire will be
 
03:43:49.790 --> 03:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
best served and your leadership will
 
03:43:51.590 --> 03:43:51.600 align:start position:0%

03:44:29.210 --> 03:44:29.220 align:start position:0%
hi good afternoon it's Ken eyring thank
 
03:44:31.670 --> 03:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
you for the time to testify
 
03:44:35.450 --> 03:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
I do support HB 599
 
03:44:36.950 --> 03:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
um I was honored to have served on
 
03:44:39.170 --> 03:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
secretary Scanlon special Committee of
 
03:44:40.490 --> 03:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
voter confidence
 
03:44:42.710 --> 03:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
because election integrity and
 
03:44:44.090 --> 03:44:44.100 align:start position:0%
confidence in our election and process
 
03:44:45.590 --> 03:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
is important
 
03:44:48.349 --> 03:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
and over the five or six months period
 
03:44:51.290 --> 03:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
where we were listening to testimony I'd
 
03:44:52.910 --> 03:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
say about half the people expressed
 
03:44:55.250 --> 03:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
concerns about our elections
 
03:44:57.830 --> 03:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'm from Windham and I have first-hand
 
03:45:00.889 --> 03:45:00.899 align:start position:0%
experience regarding what can go wrong
 
03:45:02.929 --> 03:45:02.939 align:start position:0%
when election officials don't follow
 
03:45:05.570 --> 03:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
election laws and procedures the Windham
 
03:45:08.870 --> 03:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
general election on November 2020
 
03:45:10.429 --> 03:45:10.439 align:start position:0%
produce the largest numerical
 
03:45:12.050 --> 03:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
discrepancy in the history of New
 
03:45:12.060 --> 03:45:12.950 align:start position:0%
discrepancy in the history of New
Hampshire

03:45:12.950 --> 03:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:45:16.190 --> 03:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
and over 130 violations of election laws
 
03:45:18.729 --> 03:45:18.739 align:start position:0%
and procedures were identified by the AG
 
03:45:21.650 --> 03:45:21.660 align:start position:0%
and the Secretary of State
 
03:45:23.330 --> 03:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
that led to the appointment of an
 
03:45:26.229 --> 03:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
election monitor for this past
 
03:45:29.450 --> 03:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
primary election in September but even
 
03:45:32.090 --> 03:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
with the election monitor there were
 
03:45:34.309 --> 03:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
still issues
 
03:45:36.849 --> 03:45:36.859 align:start position:0%
so I want to share just a few examples
 
03:45:39.650 --> 03:45:39.660 align:start position:0%
that were included in a complaint that I
 
03:45:42.410 --> 03:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
filed along with another Windham
 
03:45:46.010 --> 03:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
resident with the AG's office I emailed
 
03:45:48.349 --> 03:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
that to this committee earlier today
 
03:45:50.929 --> 03:45:50.939 align:start position:0%
so I I encourage you to look at that
 
03:45:52.969 --> 03:45:52.979 align:start position:0%
just to see the types of issues that
 
03:45:55.429 --> 03:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
could come up and the lack of
 
03:45:58.490 --> 03:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
um the lack of of following the proper
 
03:46:01.309 --> 03:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
procedures as defined in the election
 
03:46:02.990 --> 03:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
procedures manual and how they can
 
03:46:05.510 --> 03:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
impact an election and the results
 
03:46:08.090 --> 03:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
so here's a few examples
 
03:46:12.110 --> 03:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire one ballot promoter
 
03:46:14.030 --> 03:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
means that at the end of the day when
 
03:46:15.710 --> 03:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
the number of Voters that are announced
 
03:46:18.170 --> 03:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
and the number of ballots that were cast
 
03:46:20.929 --> 03:46:20.939 align:start position:0%
are calculated they should match
 
03:46:23.269 --> 03:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
it's one to one
 
03:46:25.130 --> 03:46:25.140 align:start position:0%
there are different methods that can be
 
03:46:27.229 --> 03:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
used to independently confirm the number
 
03:46:29.090 --> 03:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
of Voters and the number of ballots that
 
03:46:30.469 --> 03:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
were cast
 
03:46:32.510 --> 03:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
and when those totals are compared it
 
03:46:35.330 --> 03:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
ensures accuracy when they do match
 
03:46:37.429 --> 03:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
but for the Wyndham primary they did not
 
03:46:40.030 --> 03:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
match in fact they were wildly off
 
03:46:42.110 --> 03:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
enormously off
 
03:46:43.790 --> 03:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
so the number of announced voters on
 
03:46:47.330 --> 03:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
Election night was 3724.
 
03:46:49.150 --> 03:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
that number was
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
959 higher than the actual number of
 
03:46:54.410 --> 03:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
Voters that were marked as having voted
 
03:46:56.690 --> 03:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
on the election day checklist that's
 
03:47:00.650 --> 03:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
unacceptable it's unconscionable
 
03:47:03.170 --> 03:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
the number of announced voters did not
 
03:47:05.630 --> 03:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
match the number of cast ballots per the
 
03:47:08.150 --> 03:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
chain of custody records the chain of
 
03:47:11.630 --> 03:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
custody records show that there were 372
 
03:47:14.389 --> 03:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
more ballots cast than voters on
 
03:47:15.650 --> 03:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
Election night
 
03:47:17.870 --> 03:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
again that's unacceptable that's an
 
03:47:20.150 --> 03:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
enormous discrepancy especially one in
 
03:47:22.190 --> 03:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there's a history
 
03:47:25.550 --> 03:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
of of an average of One race per
 
03:47:28.309 --> 03:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
election that's decided by one or less
 
03:47:28.319 --> 03:47:30.349 align:start position:0%
election that's decided by one or less
votes

03:47:30.349 --> 03:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
votes
 
03:47:33.349 --> 03:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
and my third example out of our
 
03:47:35.690 --> 03:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
complaint is the number of election day
 
03:47:37.849 --> 03:47:37.859 align:start position:0%
ballots that were sealed in the ballot
 
03:47:40.309 --> 03:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
boxes per the chain of custody records
 
03:47:46.190 --> 03:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
was 100 was 1 333 more than the number
 
03:47:48.110 --> 03:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
of election day ballots the town
 
03:47:50.929 --> 03:47:50.939 align:start position:0%
received from the Secretary of State how
 
03:47:52.910 --> 03:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
can that be
 
03:47:56.030 --> 03:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
these are just a few examples that raise
 
03:47:59.210 --> 03:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
alarms for me and many other people and
 
03:48:01.010 --> 03:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
when I served on the committee of voter
 
03:48:02.929 --> 03:48:02.939 align:start position:0%
confidence I was shocked that people I
 
03:48:06.050 --> 03:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
did not even know came and testified and
 
03:48:07.729 --> 03:48:07.739 align:start position:0%
referenced when Tim as one of their
 
03:48:10.670 --> 03:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
reasons why they had an enormous lack of
 
03:48:13.670 --> 03:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
confidence in the voting process here
 
03:48:15.950 --> 03:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
none of those numbers that I just shared
 
03:48:18.950 --> 03:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
with you were even close and none of
 
03:48:20.570 --> 03:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
them matched and there are many many
 
03:48:22.190 --> 03:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
other examples
 
03:48:24.170 --> 03:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
I would suggest if you talk to your
 
03:48:26.330 --> 03:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
Town's moderator or town clerk they
 
03:48:27.830 --> 03:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
would tell you that
 
03:48:31.849 --> 03:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
two or three maybe four disc ballots and
 
03:48:34.429 --> 03:48:34.439 align:start position:0%
voter discrepancy is acceptable to put
 
03:48:36.530 --> 03:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
anything over that is not
 
03:48:38.630 --> 03:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
and in some of these cases they were
 
03:48:41.269 --> 03:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
over a thousand
 
03:48:43.729 --> 03:48:43.739 align:start position:0%
there were issues with uh official
 
03:48:46.370 --> 03:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
election results as well and I just want
 
03:48:48.050 --> 03:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
to touch upon a couple of these just
 
03:48:50.389 --> 03:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
again to share with you how important it
 
03:48:53.389 --> 03:48:53.399 align:start position:0%
is and how a lack of following election
 
03:48:55.849 --> 03:48:55.859 align:start position:0%
long procedures
 
03:48:59.090 --> 03:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
um is is important to look into and try
 
03:49:01.610 --> 03:49:01.620 align:start position:0%
to identify where the issues are and
 
03:49:03.650 --> 03:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
which is why I support the audit because
 
03:49:05.630 --> 03:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
I think it will help
 
03:49:07.550 --> 03:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
make all of our election officials
 
03:49:10.309 --> 03:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
across the state be more diligent in
 
03:49:13.130 --> 03:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
following the processes
 
03:49:13.140 --> 03:49:14.330 align:start position:0%
following the processes
so

03:49:14.330 --> 03:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:17.210 --> 03:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
um there were four different
 
03:49:19.610 --> 03:49:19.620 align:start position:0%
return of votes filed for the Republican
 
03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
primary and for return of votes for the
 
03:49:24.530 --> 03:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
Democrat primary The Originals on
 
03:49:26.690 --> 03:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
Election night just after election night
 
03:49:29.590 --> 03:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
and three corrected versions
 
03:49:32.570 --> 03:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
and one of those corrected Democrat
 
03:49:34.250 --> 03:49:34.260 align:start position:0%
return of vote showed two candidates
 
03:49:36.290 --> 03:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
received more votes than ballots cast
 
03:49:39.469 --> 03:49:39.479 align:start position:0%
that's an impossible outcome that should
 
03:49:42.349 --> 03:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
never even have been reported
 
03:49:44.389 --> 03:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
looking at the Republican return of
 
03:49:47.809 --> 03:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
votes the last two corrected and these
 
03:49:50.929 --> 03:49:50.939 align:start position:0%
are official return of votes
 
03:49:52.969 --> 03:49:52.979 align:start position:0%
they declared the wrong winner for this
 
03:49:55.790 --> 03:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
District 17 State Rep race
 
03:49:58.250 --> 03:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
a recount by the secretary of state
 
03:50:00.590 --> 03:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
determined the correct winner and change
 
03:50:03.590 --> 03:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
the result back so the correct person
 
03:50:06.469 --> 03:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
and the elected person is serving now
 
03:50:08.570 --> 03:50:08.580 align:start position:0%
but without that recount we would have
 
03:50:10.550 --> 03:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
the wrong person serving now in the
 
03:50:12.229 --> 03:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
State House
 
03:50:15.469 --> 03:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
so those examples and many more in the
 
03:50:18.950 --> 03:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
complaint that were filed with the AG
 
03:50:21.410 --> 03:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
there's more issues for the November 22
 
03:50:23.269 --> 03:50:23.279 align:start position:0%
general election and we're going to file
 
03:50:26.450 --> 03:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
that as a as a separate complaint in the
 
03:50:28.910 --> 03:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
upcoming weeks it takes a long time to
 
03:50:31.130 --> 03:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
put these things together because I
 
03:50:33.650 --> 03:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
provided links to all official documents
 
03:50:35.510 --> 03:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
to make it easy for the AG to do their
 
03:50:35.520 --> 03:50:37.429 align:start position:0%
to make it easy for the AG to do their
investigation

03:50:37.429 --> 03:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
03:50:40.610 --> 03:50:40.620 align:start position:0%
that's a snapshot of Windham
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
but the issues are not isolated to wind
 
03:50:42.960 --> 03:50:43.910 align:start position:0%
but the issues are not isolated to wind
him

03:50:43.910 --> 03:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
him
 
03:50:46.849 --> 03:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
other towns have issues too which is why
 
03:50:49.790 --> 03:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
I believe the audit is a good idea
 
03:50:52.250 --> 03:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
for instance there were 188 uncounted
 
03:50:54.229 --> 03:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots in bedford's November
 
03:50:56.389 --> 03:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
2020 election and when they did an
 
03:50:58.130 --> 03:50:58.140 align:start position:0%
investigation I think they found two
 
03:50:58.140 --> 03:50:59.090 align:start position:0%
investigation I think they found two
more

03:50:59.090 --> 03:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:51:01.490 --> 03:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
County and Merrimack and Nottingham also
 
03:51:03.670 --> 03:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
had ballots that were not counted
 
03:51:06.530 --> 03:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
laconia's 2020 ballots
 
03:51:09.830 --> 03:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
that had right in votes had those votes
 
03:51:12.290 --> 03:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
counted twice and the AG's office said
 
03:51:14.750 --> 03:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
that might have affected the outcome of
 
03:51:18.590 --> 03:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:20.630 --> 03:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
as a result of these known issues
 
03:51:22.910 --> 03:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
monitors were pointed to Windham Laconia
 
03:51:25.309 --> 03:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
and Bedford for the September 22 primary
 
03:51:25.319 --> 03:51:26.809 align:start position:0%
and Bedford for the September 22 primary
election

03:51:26.809 --> 03:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
election
 
03:51:29.510 --> 03:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
but as you can see in the complaint that
 
03:51:31.010 --> 03:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
I filed
 
03:51:33.110 --> 03:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
the presence of an election monitor did
 
03:51:36.050 --> 03:51:36.060 align:start position:0%
not prevent more wildly and accurate
 
03:51:39.590 --> 03:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
Errors By our Windham election officials
 
03:51:42.349 --> 03:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
that's why I support the audience the
 
03:51:42.359 --> 03:51:43.969 align:start position:0%
that's why I support the audience the
audits

03:51:43.969 --> 03:51:43.979 align:start position:0%
audits
 
03:51:46.429 --> 03:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
that would follow a business model so it
 
03:51:47.929 --> 03:51:47.939 align:start position:0%
would follow the process from the
 
03:51:49.670 --> 03:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
beginning to the end when the ballots
 
03:51:51.769 --> 03:51:51.779 align:start position:0%
were printed when they were shipped when
 
03:51:54.650 --> 03:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
they were received how many of them were
 
03:51:58.250 --> 03:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
processed by voters how many were not
 
03:51:58.260 --> 03:51:59.330 align:start position:0%
processed by voters how many were not
cast

03:51:59.330 --> 03:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
cast
 
03:52:01.309 --> 03:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
all the way through from beginning to
 
03:52:02.950 --> 03:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
end including
 
03:52:05.990 --> 03:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
verifying that the computation of votes
 
03:52:07.190 --> 03:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
at the end of the night was done
 
03:52:07.200 --> 03:52:08.269 align:start position:0%
at the end of the night was done
properly

03:52:08.269 --> 03:52:08.279 align:start position:0%
properly
 
03:52:10.250 --> 03:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
going back to the paper tapes on the
 
03:52:11.929 --> 03:52:11.939 align:start position:0%
machines making sure that they're added
 
03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
up properly and that the vote totals in
 
03:52:17.570 --> 03:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
the end reflect the will of the voters
 
03:52:21.229 --> 03:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate your time and if you
 
03:52:22.490 --> 03:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
have any questions I'll be happy to
 
03:52:23.690 --> 03:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
answer them
 
03:52:26.630 --> 03:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:52:28.550 --> 03:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you thank you very
 
03:52:28.560 --> 03:52:29.750 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you thank you very
much

03:52:29.750 --> 03:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:52:31.670 --> 03:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh I have no other pink cards except for
 
03:52:33.410 --> 03:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office
 
03:52:41.510 --> 03:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:43.550 --> 03:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
03:52:45.410 --> 03:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David Scanlon Secretary of
 
03:52:45.420 --> 03:52:46.309 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David Scanlon Secretary of
State

03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
State
 
03:52:49.190 --> 03:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
and as I get started I would like to say
 
03:52:51.950 --> 03:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
that I have worked uh with several
 
03:52:54.650 --> 03:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
members that have just testified several
 
03:52:56.090 --> 03:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
of the speakers have just testified
 
03:52:58.729 --> 03:52:58.739 align:start position:0%
before your committee and you know I
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
believe that you know their
 
03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
presentations are sincere they have
 
03:53:08.030 --> 03:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
concerns their concerns are legitimate
 
03:53:10.729 --> 03:53:10.739 align:start position:0%
um and you know we have been working
 
03:53:14.090 --> 03:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
with them to try and alleviate those
 
03:53:16.010 --> 03:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned in earlier testimony
 
03:53:17.150 --> 03:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
03:53:19.250 --> 03:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
we have a system that has been developed
 
03:53:21.050 --> 03:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
over a couple of centuries
 
03:53:23.929 --> 03:53:23.939 align:start position:0%
uh it certainly isn't perfect
 
03:53:25.550 --> 03:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
um there's always areas where we can
 
03:53:25.560 --> 03:53:27.349 align:start position:0%
um there's always areas where we can
improve

03:53:27.349 --> 03:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
improve
 
03:53:27.359 --> 03:53:29.150 align:start position:0%
improve
um

03:53:29.150 --> 03:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:32.290 --> 03:53:32.300 align:start position:0%
and with your help I mean we we do that
 
03:53:34.729 --> 03:53:34.739 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that this bill is the
 
03:53:37.790 --> 03:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
way to go I think that conducting an
 
03:53:41.690 --> 03:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
audit of several towns maybe broadening
 
03:53:46.490 --> 03:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
that scope from the 2022 election is
 
03:53:46.500 --> 03:53:47.389 align:start position:0%
that scope from the 2022 election is
um

03:53:47.389 --> 03:53:47.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:50.030 --> 03:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
is counterproductive
 
03:53:50.040 --> 03:53:50.809 align:start position:0%
is counterproductive
um

03:53:50.809 --> 03:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:52.910 --> 03:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
we know from the experience in Windham
 
03:53:54.769 --> 03:53:54.779 align:start position:0%
when there was a audit conducted there
 
03:53:56.530 --> 03:53:56.540 align:start position:0%
very similar to what's proposed here
 
03:53:58.969 --> 03:53:58.979 align:start position:0%
that it took I believe it was three
 
03:53:58.979 --> 03:53:59.990 align:start position:0%
that it took I believe it was three
weeks

03:53:59.990 --> 03:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
03:54:02.150 --> 03:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
it was
 
03:54:04.670 --> 03:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
incredibly resource intensive it was
 
03:54:07.910 --> 03:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
very expensive and it took a lot of time
 
03:54:11.030 --> 03:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
to to get that job done
 
03:54:13.130 --> 03:54:13.140 align:start position:0%
that was productive because it it
 
03:54:15.229 --> 03:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
identified the problem that that caused
 
03:54:16.790 --> 03:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
the issue in Windham and I won't get
 
03:54:19.010 --> 03:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
into that now but I'm happy to talk
 
03:54:22.190 --> 03:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
about it to anybody that's interested
 
03:54:24.050 --> 03:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
I think
 
03:54:26.809 --> 03:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
I think that doing an audit is proposed
 
03:54:28.849 --> 03:54:28.859 align:start position:0%
in this bill is not going to tell us
 
03:54:32.090 --> 03:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
anything that we don't already know and
 
03:54:35.090 --> 03:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
that we're not already working on
 
03:54:37.269 --> 03:54:37.279 align:start position:0%
and those things are being
 
03:54:39.830 --> 03:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
more transparent
 
03:54:42.910 --> 03:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
uh the elections are not meant to be
 
03:54:45.469 --> 03:54:45.479 align:start position:0%
done behind closed doors or in secret
 
03:54:46.910 --> 03:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
the only thing that should be secret
 
03:54:49.790 --> 03:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
about elections is the voters ballot
 
03:54:51.530 --> 03:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
that they've cast
 
03:54:53.630 --> 03:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
there are many checks and balances that
 
03:54:56.689 --> 03:54:56.699 align:start position:0%
are in place in a polling place
 
03:54:58.130 --> 03:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
um but that doesn't mean that sometimes
 
03:54:59.990 --> 03:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
things go wrong
 
03:55:02.809 --> 03:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
because it's a human process mistakes
 
03:55:05.750 --> 03:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
are made and mistakes need to lead to
 
03:55:08.510 --> 03:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
anomalies and those show up on the
 
03:55:10.670 --> 03:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
return of votes forms and information
 
03:55:13.250 --> 03:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
that's reported
 
03:55:15.710 --> 03:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
we do look at those when they jump out
 
03:55:19.010 --> 03:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
at us and try and find answers for them
 
03:55:21.650 --> 03:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
but the areas where we need to work to
 
03:55:26.389 --> 03:55:26.399 align:start position:0%
instill more voter confidence I believe
 
03:55:30.130 --> 03:55:30.140 align:start position:0%
doing things like post-election audits
 
03:55:34.550 --> 03:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
and the policy has been that we're
 
03:55:37.670 --> 03:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
testing systems out now in the 2022
 
03:55:39.229 --> 03:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
general election
 
03:55:41.450 --> 03:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
uh we did a number of things that
 
03:55:44.750 --> 03:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
certainly helped uh
 
03:55:47.929 --> 03:55:47.939 align:start position:0%
verify the results uh one was keeping
 
03:55:50.929 --> 03:55:50.939 align:start position:0%
track of undervotes and overvotes when
 
03:55:53.510 --> 03:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
ballots are being counted not only at
 
03:55:56.870 --> 03:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
the local level but also during recounts
 
03:55:58.969 --> 03:55:58.979 align:start position:0%
that was real really useful information
 
03:56:02.650 --> 03:56:02.660 align:start position:0%
and I think it helped give confidence
 
03:56:07.450 --> 03:56:07.460 align:start position:0%
the legislature required in the 22-22
 
03:56:11.750 --> 03:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
primary a high-speed scanner audit of
 
03:56:14.389 --> 03:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
Two Towns and then that was doubled in
 
03:56:17.510 --> 03:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
the general election to four towns
 
03:56:19.550 --> 03:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
and then in addition to that when we
 
03:56:22.729 --> 03:56:22.739 align:start position:0%
conducted recounts of state
 
03:56:25.550 --> 03:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative races we were required by
 
03:56:27.650 --> 03:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
Statute to conduct a hand audit hand
 
03:56:30.349 --> 03:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
count of uh
 
03:56:33.650 --> 03:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
a office higher up on the ticket whether
 
03:56:38.269 --> 03:56:38.279 align:start position:0%
it was a U.S Senate Governor or congress
 
03:56:41.570 --> 03:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
and we did that and in those instances
 
03:56:44.809 --> 03:56:44.819 align:start position:0%
the the results of those audits verified
 
03:56:46.670 --> 03:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
the results of the election in those
 
03:56:49.070 --> 03:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
communities that we tested but we should
 
03:56:51.410 --> 03:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
do it on a broader scale and I've been
 
03:56:52.910 --> 03:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
approached by
 
03:56:57.110 --> 03:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh some very well-known uh election
 
03:56:57.120 --> 03:56:58.130 align:start position:0%
uh some very well-known uh election
uh

03:56:58.130 --> 03:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:57:00.790 --> 03:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
technology experts at both Andrew Apel
 
03:57:04.550 --> 03:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
and Mark Linderman both names that you
 
03:57:06.050 --> 03:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
may recognize but they're very
 
03:57:08.450 --> 03:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
interested in helping New Hampshire set
 
03:57:10.969 --> 03:57:10.979 align:start position:0%
up some type of a post-election audit
 
03:57:13.610 --> 03:57:13.620 align:start position:0%
system that is statistically meaningful
 
03:57:16.250 --> 03:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
and would verify the results I think
 
03:57:17.809 --> 03:57:17.819 align:start position:0%
would be better off spending our money
 
03:57:20.630 --> 03:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
and resources going in that direction at
 
03:57:24.050 --> 03:57:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:24.060 --> 03:57:26.210 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:57:26.210 --> 03:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:28.550 --> 03:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
additional poll worker training I mean
 
03:57:31.070 --> 03:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
that is an ongoing thing and and in the
 
03:57:32.809 --> 03:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
last year we've dramatically increased
 
03:57:35.330 --> 03:57:35.340 align:start position:0%
the scope and the types of trainings
 
03:57:38.809 --> 03:57:38.819 align:start position:0%
that we put on we need to do more there
 
03:57:41.389 --> 03:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
our local election officials are not
 
03:57:44.750 --> 03:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
required to attend trading sessions uh
 
03:57:47.150 --> 03:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
they do it if they can and but we do see
 
03:57:49.429 --> 03:57:49.439 align:start position:0%
a difference those officials that tend
 
03:57:51.229 --> 03:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
to go to training usually have fewer
 
03:57:53.870 --> 03:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
problems than those that don't
 
03:57:55.610 --> 03:57:55.620 align:start position:0%
so that's an area that we should keep
 
03:57:56.870 --> 03:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
working on
 
03:57:59.210 --> 03:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
and then we're looking at additional
 
03:58:02.030 --> 03:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
technology in the polling place we are
 
03:58:05.290 --> 03:58:05.300 align:start position:0%
looking to replace the the optical scan
 
03:58:08.330 --> 03:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
accuvote ballot counting machines which
 
03:58:11.809 --> 03:58:11.819 align:start position:0%
are currently being used and aging to
 
03:58:14.150 --> 03:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
the point where you know their useful
 
03:58:17.630 --> 03:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
life is in the foreseeable future
 
03:58:21.889 --> 03:58:21.899 align:start position:0%
we are currently testing for
 
03:58:25.670 --> 03:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
digital scan about accounting devices we
 
03:58:27.889 --> 03:58:27.899 align:start position:0%
tested a model during the general
 
03:58:30.349 --> 03:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
election opens with open source software
 
03:58:33.830 --> 03:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
called voting works we are going to be
 
03:58:35.630 --> 03:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
testing three different models for the
 
03:58:38.870 --> 03:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
upcoming town elections the Dominion
 
03:58:42.110 --> 03:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
device in Londonderry and Milford
 
03:58:44.570 --> 03:58:44.580 align:start position:0%
the E and the es and S device in
 
03:58:44.580 --> 03:58:45.650 align:start position:0%
the E and the es and S device in
Winchester

03:58:45.650 --> 03:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
Winchester
 
03:58:49.610 --> 03:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
and the clear ballot device in Ashland
 
03:58:51.229 --> 03:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
so if you live near any one of those
 
03:58:52.550 --> 03:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
towns and you want to see how they're
 
03:58:54.410 --> 03:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
working you know show up at their
 
03:58:57.050 --> 03:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
polling place on town meeting day
 
03:58:58.729 --> 03:58:58.739 align:start position:0%
and then we need to encourage the
 
03:59:01.849 --> 03:59:01.859 align:start position:0%
expanded use of e-poll books right now
 
03:59:04.370 --> 03:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
there are 16 communities in New
 
03:59:06.170 --> 03:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are using electronic poll
 
03:59:06.180 --> 03:59:07.130 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are using electronic poll
books

03:59:07.130 --> 03:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
books
 
03:59:10.010 --> 03:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
to check in voters and Report the
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
information after the election that
 
03:59:14.870 --> 03:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
represents about 150 000 registered
 
03:59:18.229 --> 03:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
voters in New Hampshire
 
03:59:21.110 --> 03:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
that is going to be a really useful tool
 
03:59:24.110 --> 03:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
moving forward and I think money would
 
03:59:26.689 --> 03:59:26.699 align:start position:0%
be better spent developing that process
 
03:59:30.290 --> 03:59:30.300 align:start position:0%
as well so I will in there Mr chairman I
 
03:59:32.630 --> 03:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
would be happy to answer any questions I
 
03:59:33.710 --> 03:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
don't think you'll be able to get away
 
03:59:35.330 --> 03:59:35.340 align:start position:0%
with no questions
 
03:59:38.389 --> 03:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
um representative boam
 
03:59:40.790 --> 03:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
en thank you for taking the question
 
03:59:43.010 --> 03:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
on a three machines in Merrimack 2020
 
03:59:45.290 --> 03:59:45.300 align:start position:0%
that had the anomaly
 
03:59:49.849 --> 03:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
could you maybe somehow explain that
 
03:59:53.689 --> 03:59:53.699 align:start position:0%
I I don't have an explanation other than
 
03:59:56.450 --> 03:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
to say that there can be conditions in
 
03:59:58.250 --> 03:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
the polling place that might cause that
 
04:00:01.250 --> 04:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
and one of the more common ones in the
 
04:00:04.429 --> 04:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
2020 election with a pandemic we had
 
04:00:06.950 --> 04:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
three times more absentee ballots than
 
04:00:10.210 --> 04:00:10.220 align:start position:0%
normal and those tended to be
 
04:00:14.689 --> 04:00:14.699 align:start position:0%
by far Democratic ballots and so if if
 
04:00:17.950 --> 04:00:17.960 align:start position:0%
the local election officials were using
 
04:00:21.290 --> 04:00:21.300 align:start position:0%
a particular ballot accounting device to
 
04:00:23.630 --> 04:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
process absentee ballots that would show
 
04:00:25.729 --> 04:00:25.739 align:start position:0%
what might be considered an anomaly
 
04:00:29.630 --> 04:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
there may be other reasons that uh you
 
04:00:30.889 --> 04:00:30.899 align:start position:0%
would have to look at the conditions on
 
04:00:31.969 --> 04:00:31.979 align:start position:0%
the polling place to make that
 
04:00:31.979 --> 04:00:33.889 align:start position:0%
the polling place to make that
determination

04:00:33.889 --> 04:00:33.899 align:start position:0%
determination
 
04:00:33.899 --> 04:00:35.269 align:start position:0%
determination
follow-up

04:00:35.269 --> 04:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:00:38.750 --> 04:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
did you see any such anomaly in the 2022
 
04:00:38.760 --> 04:00:40.070 align:start position:0%
did you see any such anomaly in the 2022
election

04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
election
 
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you I didn't look at
 
04:00:45.110 --> 04:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
that especially in Merrimack
 
04:00:47.389 --> 04:00:47.399 align:start position:0%
representative weary
 
04:00:49.550 --> 04:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Vice chair and uh thank you
 
04:00:49.560 --> 04:00:50.570 align:start position:0%
thank you Vice chair and uh thank you
secretary

04:00:50.570 --> 04:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
secretary
 
04:00:50.580 --> 04:00:51.950 align:start position:0%
secretary
um

04:00:51.950 --> 04:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:55.969 --> 04:00:55.979 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of changes going on and
 
04:00:58.250 --> 04:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
you stated that you don't want to look
 
04:01:00.710 --> 04:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
back would you be in favor of a full
 
04:01:03.590 --> 04:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
skip I I assume that the
 
04:01:06.349 --> 04:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
audit looking backwards is to determine
 
04:01:08.809 --> 04:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
how widespread some of the errors that
 
04:01:11.809 --> 04:01:11.819 align:start position:0%
were found in a place like Windham are
 
04:01:13.729 --> 04:01:13.739 align:start position:0%
in other communities within New
 
04:01:16.790 --> 04:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you're proposing that we not
 
04:01:20.030 --> 04:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
look back would you be alternatively in
 
04:01:23.389 --> 04:01:23.399 align:start position:0%
favor of a full forensic audit after the
 
04:01:24.950 --> 04:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
next election after some of these
 
04:01:28.750 --> 04:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:31.790 --> 04:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
I I think there should be a reason for
 
04:01:34.490 --> 04:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
it in Windham we had a reason to look
 
04:01:35.990 --> 04:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
back because there was a huge
 
04:01:37.610 --> 04:01:37.620 align:start position:0%
discrepancy that just could not be
 
04:01:40.250 --> 04:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
explained and it was explained
 
04:01:41.689 --> 04:01:41.699 align:start position:0%
uh certainly at least to our
 
04:01:43.870 --> 04:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
satisfaction after that audit was done
 
04:01:48.110 --> 04:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
but right now there is no reason
 
04:01:50.750 --> 04:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no huge gaping
 
04:01:53.809 --> 04:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
concern that you know somebody's holding
 
04:01:55.849 --> 04:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
an office that shouldn't be there
 
04:01:58.070 --> 04:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
especially at a higher level
 
04:02:00.530 --> 04:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to look back and I
 
04:02:02.929 --> 04:02:02.939 align:start position:0%
think that certainly from my perspective
 
04:02:04.309 --> 04:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
and I think from other election
 
04:02:04.319 --> 04:02:05.750 align:start position:0%
and I think from other election
officials

04:02:05.750 --> 04:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
officials
 
04:02:07.550 --> 04:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
perspective that
 
04:02:09.650 --> 04:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
if we're going back just to see what's
 
04:02:11.809 --> 04:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
you know what can be improved in the
 
04:02:14.150 --> 04:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
election process I think we already know
 
04:02:16.429 --> 04:02:16.439 align:start position:0%
the answer to that and I think we're
 
04:02:18.830 --> 04:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
already working on those Solutions and I
 
04:02:20.929 --> 04:02:20.939 align:start position:0%
think by developing them
 
04:02:23.269 --> 04:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
we are going to build confidence
 
04:02:25.429 --> 04:02:25.439 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:02:28.490 --> 04:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
and the numbers are going to be tighter
 
04:02:30.650 --> 04:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
um and and I think that's that's
 
04:02:32.229 --> 04:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
progress I think that's the direction
 
04:02:35.630 --> 04:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
that we should head in I know that the
 
04:02:37.610 --> 04:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
Windham audit was hundreds of thousands
 
04:02:39.530 --> 04:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
of dollars
 
04:02:41.330 --> 04:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
um that's just one town
 
04:02:44.510 --> 04:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
and if we you know if we multiply that
 
04:02:46.670 --> 04:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
by five you know we're in the millions
 
04:02:50.030 --> 04:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
of dollars and if we expand that to
 
04:02:53.389 --> 04:02:53.399 align:start position:0%
large counties because we're you know
 
04:02:54.889 --> 04:02:54.899 align:start position:0%
some places outside that two percent
 
04:02:57.710 --> 04:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to blow the state budget we
 
04:02:59.210 --> 04:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
just don't have those kind of resources
 
04:03:01.309 --> 04:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
and the money that we do have I think
 
04:03:03.710 --> 04:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
should be would be better placed working
 
04:03:06.050 --> 04:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
on the initiatives that we have that I
 
04:03:06.710 --> 04:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
think are going to have meaning
 
04:03:10.010 --> 04:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
meaningful results uh for everybody
 
04:03:13.550 --> 04:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:15.229 --> 04:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
uh before we do a follow-up with any
 
04:03:16.849 --> 04:03:16.859 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee okay
 
04:03:19.130 --> 04:03:19.140 align:start position:0%
we'll do a follow-up
 
04:03:22.550 --> 04:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
so it's it would seem though I mean just
 
04:03:25.309 --> 04:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the the perceived
 
04:03:28.010 --> 04:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
lack of voter confidence is that there
 
04:03:30.469 --> 04:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
it seems like people are concerned that
 
04:03:33.050 --> 04:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
they don't know what they don't know and
 
04:03:37.210 --> 04:03:37.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:40.729 --> 04:03:40.739 align:start position:0%
this seems to be a very black box
 
04:03:43.790 --> 04:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
of approach to things you're not uh
 
04:03:46.670 --> 04:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
fully able to see or the the average
 
04:03:50.090 --> 04:03:50.100 align:start position:0%
citizen is not able able to fully see
 
04:03:54.250 --> 04:03:54.260 align:start position:0%
into that election process how
 
04:03:56.689 --> 04:03:56.699 align:start position:0%
what would you propose to kind of
 
04:04:00.050 --> 04:04:00.060 align:start position:0%
alleviate that
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
um perception and this lack of voter
 
04:04:04.330 --> 04:04:04.340 align:start position:0%
confidence that has been expressed
 
04:04:06.950 --> 04:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
you've had on an excellent point because
 
04:04:10.250 --> 04:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
where where the concern is and where the
 
04:04:11.570 --> 04:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
doubt comes in and the lack of
 
04:04:11.580 --> 04:04:13.150 align:start position:0%
doubt comes in and the lack of
confidence

04:04:13.150 --> 04:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
confidence
 
04:04:15.889 --> 04:04:15.899 align:start position:0%
occurs primarily in those areas of the
 
04:04:17.870 --> 04:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
process where the person can't actually
 
04:04:20.630 --> 04:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
see what's going on and a voting machine
 
04:04:23.870 --> 04:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
is a perfect example of that
 
04:04:27.530 --> 04:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
um absentee voting you know the absentee
 
04:04:29.150 --> 04:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
ballot leaves the possession of the Town
 
04:04:31.550 --> 04:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
Clerk and you know there's all kinds of
 
04:04:33.349 --> 04:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
theories about what happens to that
 
04:04:37.550 --> 04:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
ballot before it gets back to the clerk
 
04:04:39.650 --> 04:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
those are the areas you know if you
 
04:04:41.809 --> 04:04:41.819 align:start position:0%
listen closely enough
 
04:04:45.469 --> 04:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
where there are concerns that so somehow
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
we have to be able to
 
04:04:50.450 --> 04:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
open that process up so that
 
04:04:52.189 --> 04:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
you know the people are looking at it
 
04:04:54.830 --> 04:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
can have the confidence so one way of
 
04:04:56.870 --> 04:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
doing that is in terms of ballot
 
04:04:59.050 --> 04:04:59.060 align:start position:0%
counting machines use accounting device
 
04:05:02.330 --> 04:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
that uses open source software not
 
04:05:04.490 --> 04:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
proprietary software that's protected
 
04:05:06.830 --> 04:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
and kept secret by the company that
 
04:05:09.349 --> 04:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
makes the machine but it's software that
 
04:05:11.210 --> 04:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
anybody that has the technical knowledge
 
04:05:13.790 --> 04:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
to look at can look at it and see how
 
04:05:16.790 --> 04:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's counting the ballots and you know
 
04:05:18.590 --> 04:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's one way to do it and another way
 
04:05:21.650 --> 04:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
to do it post-election audits the
 
04:05:24.229 --> 04:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
digital scan technology today and ballot
 
04:05:26.809 --> 04:05:26.819 align:start position:0%
counting devices has the ability to
 
04:05:29.330 --> 04:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
record the image of every single ballot
 
04:05:31.969 --> 04:05:31.979 align:start position:0%
that gets fed through the machine and
 
04:05:33.830 --> 04:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
based on that you can randomly select
 
04:05:36.349 --> 04:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
ballots see how the machine counted it
 
04:05:38.210 --> 04:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
compare it to the actual paper ballot
 
04:05:40.910 --> 04:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
that was cast through the machine that
 
04:05:43.910 --> 04:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
type of thing helps build confidence
 
04:05:45.650 --> 04:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
um and so I think those are the you know
 
04:05:47.689 --> 04:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
those are the areas that we should be
 
04:05:50.389 --> 04:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
looking it's as I said earlier the only
 
04:05:52.370 --> 04:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
part of the voting process that should
 
04:05:55.610 --> 04:05:55.620 align:start position:0%
be private is how that voter voted on
 
04:05:59.150 --> 04:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:01.189 --> 04:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative Hamlet
 
04:06:07.309 --> 04:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
after chair and vice chair and thank you
 
04:06:09.830 --> 04:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
Mr Secretary of State
 
04:06:14.269 --> 04:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
um so after the November 2022 general
 
04:06:17.210 --> 04:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
election there were a lot of recounts
 
04:06:19.429 --> 04:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
and I participated I helped with a
 
04:06:21.050 --> 04:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
couple of those recounts yeah thank you
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
for that you're welcome and so were
 
04:06:27.530 --> 04:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
there any large discrepancies in those
 
04:06:29.570 --> 04:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
in the results of those Recons a lot of
 
04:06:32.870 --> 04:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
this were you know hand recounts of
 
04:06:34.750 --> 04:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
voting machine
 
04:06:37.309 --> 04:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
elections I don't know how many we're
 
04:06:39.290 --> 04:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
voting machine left but there were you
 
04:06:42.050 --> 04:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
know these were hand count re recounts
 
04:06:45.769 --> 04:06:45.779 align:start position:0%
were there very many discrepancies
 
04:06:47.689 --> 04:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
it depends on what you call a
 
04:06:50.210 --> 04:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
discrepancy I mean there was some
 
04:06:52.269 --> 04:06:52.279 align:start position:0%
movement in the numbers between
 
04:06:56.349 --> 04:06:56.359 align:start position:0%
candidates but for the most part the
 
04:06:59.510 --> 04:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
recounts affirmed the results of the
 
04:07:01.790 --> 04:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
election Night results
 
04:07:04.250 --> 04:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of races that
 
04:07:04.260 --> 04:07:05.510 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of races that
flipped

04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
flipped
 
04:07:08.150 --> 04:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
um one yeah was a little controversial
 
04:07:11.630 --> 04:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
because I uh
 
04:07:13.550 --> 04:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
decided to continue to recount the
 
04:07:15.590 --> 04:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester Ward 6 because based on the
 
04:07:17.150 --> 04:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
information that
 
04:07:19.010 --> 04:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
we had been required to collect by the
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
legislature coupled with uh audit which
 
04:07:25.370 --> 04:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
by chance happened to be that Ward you
 
04:07:27.229 --> 04:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
know it was very obvious looking at the
 
04:07:28.969 --> 04:07:28.979 align:start position:0%
numbers that not all of the ballots have
 
04:07:31.010 --> 04:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
been counted in that race during the
 
04:07:33.469 --> 04:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
recount and so you know I had a very
 
04:07:33.479 --> 04:07:34.790 align:start position:0%
recount and so you know I had a very
difficult

04:07:34.790 --> 04:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
04:07:37.250 --> 04:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
decision and that was you know do you
 
04:07:38.809 --> 04:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
let the results stand from the recount
 
04:07:38.819 --> 04:07:40.370 align:start position:0%
let the results stand from the recount
or

04:07:40.370 --> 04:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:07:41.870 --> 04:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
you know do you make sure the votes are
 
04:07:45.050 --> 04:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
counted and so I made the decision
 
04:07:47.090 --> 04:07:47.100 align:start position:0%
to count the rest of the votes that
 
04:07:49.130 --> 04:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
forced a court issue which is where that
 
04:07:51.410 --> 04:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
should have ended up uh and we had
 
04:07:53.689 --> 04:07:53.699 align:start position:0%
resolution to it but
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
um but for the most part the numbers
 
04:07:57.290 --> 04:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
were within a range that you would
 
04:08:01.490 --> 04:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
expect to see after an election when
 
04:08:03.889 --> 04:08:03.899 align:start position:0%
when ballot counting devices are
 
04:08:05.389 --> 04:08:05.399 align:start position:0%
counting ballots
 
04:08:07.849 --> 04:08:07.859 align:start position:0%
you sacrificed a little bit of accuracy
 
04:08:11.570 --> 04:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
for Speed because the machine will not
 
04:08:11.580 --> 04:08:12.530 align:start position:0%
for Speed because the machine will not
read

04:08:12.530 --> 04:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
read
 
04:08:15.110 --> 04:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
a ballot or a mark on a ballot that is
 
04:08:17.510 --> 04:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
not in the proper place even though
 
04:08:19.309 --> 04:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the ballot you can determine
 
04:08:22.010 --> 04:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
what the voter intent was and so there
 
04:08:24.290 --> 04:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
are differences it wouldn't be unusual
 
04:08:26.570 --> 04:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
for a town like Merrimack to have
 
04:08:29.570 --> 04:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
everybody's votes go up maybe 20 votes
 
04:08:30.950 --> 04:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
because of that
 
04:08:30.960 --> 04:08:31.790 align:start position:0%
because of that
um

04:08:31.790 --> 04:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:33.769 --> 04:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
but that's why we have recounts you know
 
04:08:36.349 --> 04:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
if the race is close and people have
 
04:08:37.910 --> 04:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
questions they can easily request a
 
04:08:40.010 --> 04:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
recount we had a record number of
 
04:08:42.349 --> 04:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
recounts by the way 31 have been
 
04:08:42.359 --> 04:08:45.650 align:start position:0%
recounts by the way 31 have been
requested

04:08:45.650 --> 04:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:47.570 --> 04:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:08:50.269 --> 04:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Brennan
 
04:08:52.250 --> 04:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:08:55.130 --> 04:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
it's on your knowledge and it experience
 
04:08:56.630 --> 04:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire election
 
04:08:59.389 --> 04:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
elect safe secure and have long history
 
04:09:01.550 --> 04:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
of producing reliable trustworthy
 
04:09:05.570 --> 04:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:08.150 --> 04:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:09:10.130 --> 04:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for saying none thank you
 
04:09:13.010 --> 04:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to close the um I'm sorry I
 
04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
got to do the blue sheet
 
04:09:16.070 --> 04:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
um was it aikenberg you give me the blue
 
04:09:18.889 --> 04:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
sheet does anyone else wish to speak to
 
04:09:22.010 --> 04:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
House Bill oh my goodness I lost my spot
 
04:09:24.170 --> 04:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
uh house bill
 
04:09:28.490 --> 04:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:29.990 --> 04:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:09:32.870 --> 04:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh on the blue sheet there are one two
 
04:09:35.510 --> 04:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
three people signed in favor and one two
 
04:09:38.510 --> 04:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
three people signed as a post uh with
 
04:09:40.729 --> 04:09:40.739 align:start position:0%

um House Bill 259 I don't believe I have
 
04:10:04.849 --> 04:10:04.859 align:start position:0%
a pink card for house bill 259. yes
 
04:10:09.410 --> 04:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:22.330 --> 04:10:22.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:29.229 --> 04:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:31.189 --> 04:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much I'd like
 
04:10:32.570 --> 04:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
to thank the members of the committee
 
04:10:35.630 --> 04:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
for this opportunity to speak in favor
 
04:10:39.650 --> 04:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 259 uh when I was a kid I
 
04:10:41.750 --> 04:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
grew up in central Vermont a couple of
 
04:10:44.330 --> 04:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
hours from here well more than that from
 
04:10:46.670 --> 04:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
here a couple hours from where I live
 
04:10:49.550 --> 04:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
um and you know one of the great uh
 
04:10:52.429 --> 04:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
memories of of my youth is going to town
 
04:10:54.769 --> 04:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
meeting day uh once a year my parents
 
04:10:56.990 --> 04:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
always went my brother and I uh
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
volunteered at town meeting day running
 
04:10:59.809 --> 04:10:59.819 align:start position:0%
the microphones around so everybody
 
04:11:02.990 --> 04:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
could uh it could be heard and it was a
 
04:11:05.210 --> 04:11:05.220 align:start position:0%
great introduction to kind of New
 
04:11:07.370 --> 04:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
England democracy direct democracy votes
 
04:11:08.929 --> 04:11:08.939 align:start position:0%
over you know what road is going to get
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
graded this year and if we buy a new
 
04:11:14.210 --> 04:11:14.220 align:start position:0%
fire truck and and things like that
 
04:11:16.610 --> 04:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things you know we
 
04:11:17.809 --> 04:11:17.819 align:start position:0%
would stay afterwards my parents
 
04:11:22.250 --> 04:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
volunteered and counted uh votes and uh
 
04:11:23.570 --> 04:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
one of the things I learned from that
 
04:11:26.330 --> 04:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
about hand counting for example is even
 
04:11:28.969 --> 04:11:28.979 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at like 80 votes in
 
04:11:30.429 --> 04:11:30.439 align:start position:0%
a small town
 
04:11:32.929 --> 04:11:32.939 align:start position:0%
there are going to be miscounts right
 
04:11:35.570 --> 04:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
three or four recounts of the same 80
 
04:11:37.130 --> 04:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
votes in order to figure out whether or
 
04:11:39.650 --> 04:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
not you're going to buy a fire truck so
 
04:11:42.650 --> 04:11:42.660 align:start position:0%
it speaks in ways to the
 
04:11:42.660 --> 04:11:43.370 align:start position:0%
it speaks in ways to the
um

04:11:43.370 --> 04:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:45.410 --> 04:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
not always accurate results of hand
 
04:11:49.429 --> 04:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
counting even small numbers of votes
 
04:11:51.889 --> 04:11:51.899 align:start position:0%
we have a really special culture
 
04:11:53.389 --> 04:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
political culture here in New Hampshire
 
04:11:54.830 --> 04:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
which is why some of us feel very
 
04:11:56.929 --> 04:11:56.939 align:start position:0%
passionately about New Hampshire's
 
04:11:59.210 --> 04:11:59.220 align:start position:0%
statuses first in the nation
 
04:12:02.150 --> 04:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
primary we have high voter turnout
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
compared to a lot of other states we
 
04:12:07.729 --> 04:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
also have high voter confidence but at
 
04:12:09.769 --> 04:12:09.779 align:start position:0%
the moment we also do have a relatively
 
04:12:12.889 --> 04:12:12.899 align:start position:0%
high level of voter distrust in the
 
04:12:15.530 --> 04:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
accuracy of our elections as we've just
 
04:12:18.590 --> 04:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
heard quite a bit about
 
04:12:20.809 --> 04:12:20.819 align:start position:0%
the Constitution of the United States
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
guarantees us a right to trial by jury
 
04:12:26.030 --> 04:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
right and so we have a jury system
 
04:12:27.950 --> 04:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
because it is our Collective
 
04:12:30.830 --> 04:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility to participate in that
 
04:12:32.929 --> 04:12:32.939 align:start position:0%
process we have a right and we have a
 
04:12:35.210 --> 04:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
responsibility right
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh the bill that I presented uh 259 is
 
04:12:41.090 --> 04:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
intended to have us think about voting
 
04:12:43.610 --> 04:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
in similar terms this is a you know one
 
04:12:45.530 --> 04:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
of our most precious constitutional
 
04:12:49.729 --> 04:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
rights uh and uh I think that there's
 
04:12:52.969 --> 04:12:52.979 align:start position:0%
some opportunity to think here about the
 
04:12:54.590 --> 04:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that come along with
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
participating in that system having
 
04:12:58.429 --> 04:12:58.439 align:start position:0%
those rights and having certain
 
04:13:02.570 --> 04:13:02.580 align:start position:0%
responsibilities uh I have uh friends in
 
04:13:04.670 --> 04:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
in Germany I am by training my
 
04:13:07.550 --> 04:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
profession is is a German historian and
 
04:13:10.010 --> 04:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
they have requirements to work at polls
 
04:13:11.510 --> 04:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
on election days
 
04:13:14.990 --> 04:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh and that is in part for Germany it's
 
04:13:16.490 --> 04:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
a really important kind of development
 
04:13:18.590 --> 04:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
in their civic culture in response to
 
04:13:20.929 --> 04:13:20.939 align:start position:0%
the problems with authoritarianism in
 
04:13:23.809 --> 04:13:23.819 align:start position:0%
their past but election day there is uh
 
04:13:28.070 --> 04:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's a day off uh and uh they have a
 
04:13:30.349 --> 04:13:30.359 align:start position:0%
system whereby people have to it's it's
 
04:13:32.689 --> 04:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
not tied into the jury system like uh
 
04:13:35.990 --> 04:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
like I'm proposing here uh but is uh
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
people have to serve on a regular basis
 
04:13:40.610 --> 04:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
working at polls on election days
 
04:13:45.490 --> 04:13:45.500 align:start position:0%
uh and there are a number of
 
04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
aspects of our current political culture
 
04:13:49.429 --> 04:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
I think that could be served really well
 
04:13:51.650 --> 04:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
by thinking about
 
04:13:55.010 --> 04:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
our participation in elections in ways
 
04:13:57.349 --> 04:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
that are similar to our participation in
 
04:13:59.630 --> 04:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
the jury process as a right that's
 
04:14:02.450 --> 04:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
accompanied by responsibility uh first
 
04:14:04.490 --> 04:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
of all I think it can help address some
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
of the voter confidence issues
 
04:14:10.429 --> 04:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
getting people involved in the process
 
04:14:12.530 --> 04:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
is one of the most effective ways of
 
04:14:13.610 --> 04:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
making them feel that they have
 
04:14:15.050 --> 04:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
ownership of the process and to believe
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
that the the process is accurate in fact
 
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
we know I went to one of the the special
 
04:14:22.910 --> 04:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
commissions meetings in Keene in
 
04:14:27.250 --> 04:14:27.260 align:start position:0%
September and studies that were
 
04:14:29.750 --> 04:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
spoken about at that meeting indicate
 
04:14:32.870 --> 04:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
that The Closer the election is to your
 
04:14:34.490 --> 04:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
local level the more likely you are to
 
04:14:36.889 --> 04:14:36.899 align:start position:0%
have confidence in the results right so
 
04:14:39.170 --> 04:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
if you go from a town to a county to the
 
04:14:42.590 --> 04:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
state to the National level you see lack
 
04:14:45.950 --> 04:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
of confidence increase as the distance
 
04:14:49.070 --> 04:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
from the voter to the election increases
 
04:14:52.429 --> 04:14:52.439 align:start position:0%
right so uh getting people involved I
 
04:14:56.210 --> 04:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
think is a potentially a beneficial
 
04:14:59.030 --> 04:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
result of of this kind of system and
 
04:15:00.650 --> 04:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
hopefully helping to to raise confidence
 
04:15:03.410 --> 04:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
by again giving people ownership in the
 
04:15:03.420 --> 04:15:04.610 align:start position:0%
by again giving people ownership in the
process

04:15:04.610 --> 04:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:15:06.769 --> 04:15:06.779 align:start position:0%
I think overall it it raises the level
 
04:15:08.330 --> 04:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
of Engagement we have a high voter
 
04:15:11.090 --> 04:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
turnout in New Hampshire but it is still
 
04:15:12.710 --> 04:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know there are lots of folks who
 
04:15:15.229 --> 04:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
don't uh vote and certainly it is their
 
04:15:17.150 --> 04:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
right to not vote just it is is your
 
04:15:19.010 --> 04:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
right to not Avail yourself of the
 
04:15:20.750 --> 04:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to trial by jury
 
04:15:24.889 --> 04:15:24.899 align:start position:0%
and choose a trial by judge if you wish
 
04:15:26.450 --> 04:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
um but we can increase that level of
 
04:15:27.950 --> 04:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
Engagement I think that we should all
 
04:15:30.290 --> 04:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
have that as a goal increasing the
 
04:15:32.389 --> 04:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
number of our citizens who are legally
 
04:15:36.290 --> 04:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
eligible to vote uh uh to do so
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
I also am particularly concerned in
 
04:15:43.809 --> 04:15:43.819 align:start position:0%
our current culture at what has become
 
04:15:46.189 --> 04:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
much more so outside of New Hampshire
 
04:15:49.610 --> 04:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
for sure but a pervasive culture of of
 
04:15:52.250 --> 04:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
harassment of of poll workers
 
04:15:55.010 --> 04:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
we have a very divided culture very US
 
04:15:57.410 --> 04:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
versus them kind of culture uh
 
04:15:58.969 --> 04:15:58.979 align:start position:0%
politically and that extends in many
 
04:16:02.330 --> 04:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
ways to how people regard and treat poll
 
04:16:04.130 --> 04:16:04.140 align:start position:0%
workers if they feel that somehow the
 
04:16:06.410 --> 04:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
system is being rigged they tend to
 
04:16:07.969 --> 04:16:07.979 align:start position:0%
regard the people who are actually
 
04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
participating in the civic duty and and
 
04:16:13.490 --> 04:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
responsibility of working at the polls
 
04:16:15.110 --> 04:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
they tend to regard them as the them
 
04:16:16.929 --> 04:16:16.939 align:start position:0%
that are somehow
 
04:16:20.570 --> 04:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
undermining your right and so I think
 
04:16:22.790 --> 04:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
that having a system like this where
 
04:16:25.309 --> 04:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
people uh average citizens like
 
04:16:28.189 --> 04:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
ourselves are brought into the uh the
 
04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
polling place to work uh hopefully is
 
04:16:33.650 --> 04:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
going to help break down that US versus
 
04:16:36.290 --> 04:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
them mentality that makes unfortunately
 
04:16:38.570 --> 04:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of people feel that they have
 
04:16:41.689 --> 04:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
license to abuse poll workers while they
 
04:16:44.090 --> 04:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
themselves do nothing to participate in
 
04:16:45.469 --> 04:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
the system that they stand by and
 
04:16:45.479 --> 04:16:46.729 align:start position:0%
the system that they stand by and
criticize

04:16:46.729 --> 04:16:46.739 align:start position:0%
criticize
 
04:16:49.370 --> 04:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
so I see these as a number of of
 
04:16:52.969 --> 04:16:52.979 align:start position:0%
beneficial outcomes of
 
04:16:55.130 --> 04:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
04:16:58.130 --> 04:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
having something comparable to our jury
 
04:16:59.870 --> 04:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
system with regard guard to poll workers
 
04:17:01.849 --> 04:17:01.859 align:start position:0%
I think there are a lot of ways that
 
04:17:02.990 --> 04:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
this could play out I had a great
 
04:17:04.189 --> 04:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
meeting with the secretary of state
 
04:17:05.990 --> 04:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
where we threw back and forth some
 
04:17:07.370 --> 04:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
different scenarios well what about this
 
04:17:09.650 --> 04:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
what about that those details obviously
 
04:17:11.030 --> 04:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
would need to be worked out that's why
 
04:17:13.189 --> 04:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
this bill provides for a special
 
04:17:15.670 --> 04:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
committee uh that would then
 
04:17:17.689 --> 04:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
potentially charge the Secretary of
 
04:17:19.670 --> 04:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
State's office with doing a feasibility
 
04:17:23.570 --> 04:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
study but those are what I see as the
 
04:17:26.510 --> 04:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
benefits of thinking about working at
 
04:17:28.910 --> 04:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
polls differently uh and I'm happy to
 
04:17:30.410 --> 04:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
take your questions and look forward to
 
04:17:33.469 --> 04:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to engage in conversation
 
04:17:36.830 --> 04:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
about uh about my bill
 
04:17:38.510 --> 04:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um questions from the
 
04:17:40.429 --> 04:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
committee reminder this is a bill to
 
04:17:42.590 --> 04:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
form a committee to issue the Secretary
 
04:17:44.990 --> 04:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
of State to start a commission so keep
 
04:17:50.150 --> 04:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:51.769 --> 04:17:51.779 align:start position:0%
I successfully batted down the questions
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you representative uh I
 
04:17:56.750 --> 04:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
don't have anyone else to speak other
 
04:17:59.090 --> 04:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
than secretary Scanlon um so secretary
 
04:18:01.370 --> 04:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
Scanlon three minutes on the bill to
 
04:18:03.229 --> 04:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
form a committee to force you to have a
 
04:18:03.239 --> 04:18:05.870 align:start position:0%
form a committee to force you to have a
commission

04:18:05.870 --> 04:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:18:09.950 --> 04:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David Scanlon Secretary of
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
State and I'm happy to support this bill
 
04:18:16.490 --> 04:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
I did have a good conversation with
 
04:18:18.889 --> 04:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
representative germana about his idea
 
04:18:21.710 --> 04:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
and I think it dovetails nicely into
 
04:18:24.429 --> 04:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
the ability to vote to to
 
04:18:27.710 --> 04:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
build voter confidence
 
04:18:30.950 --> 04:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
in the state you know one of the ways
 
04:18:32.450 --> 04:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
that you do that in addition to being
 
04:18:34.849 --> 04:18:34.859 align:start position:0%
transparent is you educate the voting
 
04:18:37.130 --> 04:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
population on exactly how the voting
 
04:18:39.530 --> 04:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
process works and there's no better way
 
04:18:41.570 --> 04:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
to do that than to actually participate
 
04:18:44.750 --> 04:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
as a poll worker and work in the polling
 
04:18:44.760 --> 04:18:46.010 align:start position:0%
as a poll worker and work in the polling
place

04:18:46.010 --> 04:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
so you know I think it might be a lot to
 
04:18:49.439 --> 04:18:50.269 align:start position:0%
so you know I think it might be a lot to
ask

04:18:50.269 --> 04:18:50.279 align:start position:0%
ask
 
04:18:53.510 --> 04:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
to have a a jury pull type selection
 
04:18:55.969 --> 04:18:55.979 align:start position:0%
process where you're mandated to work on
 
04:18:57.950 --> 04:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
the day of the election but there might
 
04:18:59.689 --> 04:18:59.699 align:start position:0%
be a variation of it where individuals
 
04:19:03.229 --> 04:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
can be selected at random and asked if
 
04:19:05.570 --> 04:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
they want to participate on the day of
 
04:19:07.790 --> 04:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
the election and there may be other ways
 
04:19:09.189 --> 04:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
to encourage
 
04:19:11.630 --> 04:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
participation of potential poll workers
 
04:19:13.729 --> 04:19:13.739 align:start position:0%
so I'll stop there and answer any
 
04:19:13.739 --> 04:19:14.809 align:start position:0%
so I'll stop there and answer any
questions

04:19:14.809 --> 04:19:14.819 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:19:18.250 --> 04:19:18.260 align:start position:0%
okay questions from the committee
 
04:19:21.170 --> 04:19:21.180 align:start position:0%
uh we'll go with representative Hamer
 
04:19:23.150 --> 04:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:19:26.990 --> 04:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
now these people that are like juried
 
04:19:27.000 --> 04:19:28.429 align:start position:0%
now these people that are like juried
people

04:19:28.429 --> 04:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:19:29.630 --> 04:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to go through
 
04:19:32.929 --> 04:19:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:34.610 --> 04:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
they should
 
04:19:36.710 --> 04:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
um but you know the current process
 
04:19:39.229 --> 04:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
right now does not require that
 
04:19:40.969 --> 04:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
um and if
 
04:19:43.910 --> 04:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
if the moderator or the clerk or the
 
04:19:47.150 --> 04:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
Selectmen are looking for people to
 
04:19:49.070 --> 04:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
conduct an election if they don't have
 
04:19:51.469 --> 04:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
enough experienced staff they have to
 
04:19:53.389 --> 04:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
pull from somewhere to get the job done
 
04:19:53.399 --> 04:19:54.469 align:start position:0%
pull from somewhere to get the job done
and

04:19:54.469 --> 04:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:19:58.010 --> 04:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh you know this type of effort might be
 
04:19:59.510 --> 04:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
a way for people to ease into that
 
04:19:59.520 --> 04:20:02.210 align:start position:0%
a way for people to ease into that
process

04:20:02.210 --> 04:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:04.130 --> 04:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead we had heard
 
04:20:06.229 --> 04:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
from you so much today you know
 
04:20:08.150 --> 04:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
should I should I should I sit back
 
04:20:10.250 --> 04:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
really for the rest of the day I think
 
04:20:11.870 --> 04:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'm in a penalty box excuse me Mr
 
04:20:14.870 --> 04:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
secretary thank you Mr Vice chair
 
04:20:14.880 --> 04:20:16.070 align:start position:0%
secretary thank you Mr Vice chair
um

04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:19.010 --> 04:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
do you would so this would be a way of
 
04:20:21.110 --> 04:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
kind of in there you know one one thing
 
04:20:23.030 --> 04:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
would be to force people to serve and
 
04:20:25.130 --> 04:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
and like we do kind of force people to
 
04:20:26.510 --> 04:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
serve on juries another be to invite
 
04:20:30.650 --> 04:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
them to volunte to to step forward
 
04:20:32.809 --> 04:20:32.819 align:start position:0%
um how about would you favor other ways
 
04:20:34.849 --> 04:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
of getting people to voluntarily offer
 
04:20:37.969 --> 04:20:37.979 align:start position:0%
themselves like paying them more or you
 
04:20:40.189 --> 04:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
know using public service announcements
 
04:20:42.229 --> 04:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
on radio stations to invite people to
 
04:20:43.550 --> 04:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
volunteer something like that before
 
04:20:45.050 --> 04:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
04:20:48.050 --> 04:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
kind of commission or committee to form
 
04:20:50.030 --> 04:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
a commission
 
04:20:51.769 --> 04:20:51.779 align:start position:0%
the short answer is yes
 
04:20:53.450 --> 04:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
um you know we when we're looking at
 
04:20:55.370 --> 04:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
ways that we can encourage more poll
 
04:20:58.189 --> 04:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
worker participation and there's one
 
04:21:01.370 --> 04:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
there is one uh initiative that I'm
 
04:21:03.410 --> 04:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
looking at right now which is
 
04:21:05.330 --> 04:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
encouraging veterans who have served
 
04:21:08.150 --> 04:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
their country uh you know fought to
 
04:21:11.030 --> 04:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
defend the right to vote and in their
 
04:21:12.410 --> 04:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
older years of retirement years
 
04:21:14.389 --> 04:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
encouraged them to come and actually
 
04:21:17.870 --> 04:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
participate in that process and I'm
 
04:21:20.269 --> 04:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
pretty excited about that but there's
 
04:21:23.090 --> 04:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
other ways to achieve the same goal and
 
04:21:28.030 --> 04:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:31.130 --> 04:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
representative wood
 
04:21:34.189 --> 04:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm new to this
 
04:21:37.010 --> 04:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm not trying to be
 
04:21:40.010 --> 04:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
funny here but uh since you seem to be
 
04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
ahead uh okay with putting this
 
04:21:45.590 --> 04:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
committee together can I just recommend
 
04:21:49.729 --> 04:21:49.739 align:start position:0%
itl and let you do your job am I missing
 
04:21:51.170 --> 04:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
something here I'm not sure I'm not
 
04:21:52.849 --> 04:21:52.859 align:start position:0%
trying to be flipping so if I am I
 
04:21:52.859 --> 04:21:54.710 align:start position:0%
trying to be flipping so if I am I
apologize

04:21:54.710 --> 04:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
04:21:58.729 --> 04:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
we we would work on this on this anyway
 
04:22:01.790 --> 04:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
um but sometimes the study committee can
 
04:22:03.530 --> 04:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
you know bring
 
04:22:05.450 --> 04:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
more people together who have different
 
04:22:08.809 --> 04:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
ideas and and uh you know things come up
 
04:22:10.969 --> 04:22:10.979 align:start position:0%
that I might not think of and how that
 
04:22:12.290 --> 04:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
process might work but the short answer
 
04:22:14.269 --> 04:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
is yes we would be working on this
 
04:22:17.210 --> 04:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
anyway okay thank you
 
04:22:19.550 --> 04:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative weary
 
04:22:22.370 --> 04:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the veterans again what a
 
04:22:25.490 --> 04:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:28.189 --> 04:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
how about for secondary education where
 
04:22:30.830 --> 04:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
you have high school individuals who are
 
04:22:33.349 --> 04:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
you know may have to do a senior project
 
04:22:36.170 --> 04:22:36.180 align:start position:0%
or community service project this could
 
04:22:38.269 --> 04:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
align with Civics instructions and the
 
04:22:41.450 --> 04:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
secretary's secondary schools what's the
 
04:22:43.550 --> 04:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
possibility of doing something like that
 
04:22:45.590 --> 04:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
similar to what you're proposing for the
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
use of the veterans in that capacity
 
04:22:51.590 --> 04:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
I think that's a great idea currently in
 
04:22:53.630 --> 04:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
statute 17 year olds are allowed to
 
04:22:55.729 --> 04:22:55.739 align:start position:0%
actually work in a polling place as an
 
04:22:57.429 --> 04:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
election official
 
04:22:59.389 --> 04:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
there have been
 
04:23:01.670 --> 04:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
small initiatives in the past to try and
 
04:23:03.950 --> 04:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
develop that a little bit further and
 
04:23:06.830 --> 04:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
they haven't taken off but we should get
 
04:23:08.750 --> 04:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
our youth involved early because once
 
04:23:10.130 --> 04:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
they start voting they tend to stay
 
04:23:11.630 --> 04:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
voting and
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
I think that would be a very positive
 
04:23:13.439 --> 04:23:14.630 align:start position:0%
I think that would be a very positive
thing

04:23:14.630 --> 04:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:23:16.370 --> 04:23:16.380 align:start position:0%

um
 
04:23:22.729 --> 04:23:22.739 align:start position:0%
do we know of any other states that make
 
04:23:25.670 --> 04:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
this a requirement or a civic duty
 
04:23:27.650 --> 04:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any that doesn't mean
 
04:23:29.269 --> 04:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
there aren't some that exist I just
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
um follow-up follow-up please as I uh
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
working in a Maya local elections for
 
04:23:39.769 --> 04:23:39.779 align:start position:0%
several years this has always been the
 
04:23:41.630 --> 04:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
biggest issue is trying to find a
 
04:23:43.030 --> 04:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
balanced party
 
04:23:45.710 --> 04:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
volunteer or paid volunteer as you say
 
04:23:45.720 --> 04:23:47.150 align:start position:0%
volunteer or paid volunteer as you say
so

04:23:47.150 --> 04:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:49.250 --> 04:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
um would there be any penalties for
 
04:23:52.389 --> 04:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
people that choose not to if this
 
04:23:56.950 --> 04:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
process were to take place do we know of
 
04:23:59.990 --> 04:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
again I you know I think I don't
 
04:24:01.849 --> 04:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
personally support making it mandatory
 
04:24:04.490 --> 04:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
for somebody to be selected in a jury
 
04:24:07.370 --> 04:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
pool type situation but I think that
 
04:24:09.469 --> 04:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
idea could be used to
 
04:24:12.229 --> 04:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
send invitations to voters that are
 
04:24:14.269 --> 04:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
selected at random you know would you
 
04:24:15.830 --> 04:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
like to participate
 
04:24:18.469 --> 04:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh in the polling place on the day of
 
04:24:20.630 --> 04:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
the election in service of civic duty
 
04:24:22.729 --> 04:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
and see if you can you know just get
 
04:24:25.610 --> 04:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
there you know their their pride to come
 
04:24:28.070 --> 04:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
forward and you know have them Step Up
 
04:24:30.710 --> 04:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
sure one more of course just as an
 
04:24:30.720 --> 04:24:31.910 align:start position:0%
sure one more of course just as an
encouragement

04:24:31.910 --> 04:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
encouragement
 
04:24:31.920 --> 04:24:32.809 align:start position:0%
encouragement
um

04:24:32.809 --> 04:24:32.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:34.250 --> 04:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
part of
 
04:24:37.490 --> 04:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
um some homeschooling students that um
 
04:24:41.750 --> 04:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
are in my area is to help and provide
 
04:24:44.689 --> 04:24:44.699 align:start position:0%
food things like that for the poll
 
04:24:47.210 --> 04:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
workers as just a contribution to them
 
04:24:51.290 --> 04:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
being there and certainly the idea of
 
04:24:53.710 --> 04:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
high school students is a great idea
 
04:24:56.030 --> 04:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps that would be something to
 
04:24:58.010 --> 04:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
really March forward with and pushing
 
04:24:59.710 --> 04:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
forward through our education system
 
04:25:04.010 --> 04:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you and the
 
04:25:07.729 --> 04:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
a community can use younger people if
 
04:25:09.349 --> 04:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
they want to they just can't be election
 
04:25:11.510 --> 04:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
officials but they could do things like
 
04:25:14.450 --> 04:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
you know Mana a food table or you know
 
04:25:14.460 --> 04:25:15.170 align:start position:0%
you know Mana a food table or you know
help

04:25:15.170 --> 04:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
help
 
04:25:18.290 --> 04:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
help bring things back and forth to the
 
04:25:20.389 --> 04:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
election workers
 
04:25:22.729 --> 04:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
um you know there may be roles that they
 
04:25:22.739 --> 04:25:23.990 align:start position:0%
um you know there may be roles that they
can

04:25:23.990 --> 04:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:25:26.090 --> 04:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
do in the polling place to make it
 
04:25:27.710 --> 04:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
easier for everybody else but also give
 
04:25:30.469 --> 04:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
them some exposure
 
04:25:32.269 --> 04:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sure all those questions will be
 
04:25:33.530 --> 04:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
answered in the committee to form the
 
04:25:33.540 --> 04:25:34.969 align:start position:0%
answered in the committee to form the
commission

04:25:34.969 --> 04:25:34.979 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:25:37.269 --> 04:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:25:40.610 --> 04:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
representative Bay
 
04:25:43.370 --> 04:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
04:25:45.710 --> 04:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
secretary for taking my question uh the
 
04:25:48.349 --> 04:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
spirit of my question is as someone who
 
04:25:51.469 --> 04:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
has take paid time off to do this work
 
04:25:55.429 --> 04:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
um so with with the uh if this is a
 
04:25:57.170 --> 04:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
civic duty like
 
04:26:00.349 --> 04:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
um jury duty would it be a requirement
 
04:26:04.670 --> 04:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
for employers to employ uh
 
04:26:07.550 --> 04:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
individuals from New Hampshire to allow
 
04:26:10.910 --> 04:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
their employees to charge their time to
 
04:26:13.370 --> 04:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
jury duty when they are serving uh
 
04:26:16.490 --> 04:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:19.790 --> 04:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
again you know if it was mandatory
 
04:26:22.010 --> 04:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
which I don't favor I you know I don't
 
04:26:24.050 --> 04:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
know I that would have to be developed
 
04:26:27.050 --> 04:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
in the bill but that's a good question
 
04:26:28.849 --> 04:26:28.859 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan
 
04:26:30.830 --> 04:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question this
 
04:26:30.840 --> 04:26:31.729 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question this
bill

04:26:31.729 --> 04:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:26:34.429 --> 04:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
um outlines the membership of the
 
04:26:36.290 --> 04:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
committee as three members of the house
 
04:26:39.290 --> 04:26:39.300 align:start position:0%
two members of the Senate if you do you
 
04:26:43.130 --> 04:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
need legislation to include
 
04:26:46.429 --> 04:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
to create your own committee as you are
 
04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
exploring these
 
04:26:50.929 --> 04:26:50.939 align:start position:0%
um ways where you might
 
04:26:54.050 --> 04:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
invite more volunteers to become poll
 
04:26:56.809 --> 04:26:56.819 align:start position:0%
workers do you need
 
04:26:59.689 --> 04:26:59.699 align:start position:0%
a bill do you need legislation to
 
04:27:02.030 --> 04:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
involve members of the house or members
 
04:27:04.630 --> 04:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
of the senate in that exploration
 
04:27:08.210 --> 04:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
to invite more poll workers no no I
 
04:27:10.130 --> 04:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
think you know if I wanted to create an
 
04:27:12.290 --> 04:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
ad hoc committee I could certainly do
 
04:27:13.910 --> 04:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
that that's the way I created the
 
04:27:16.630 --> 04:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
special committee on voter confidence
 
04:27:18.950 --> 04:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know which is a fairly high profile
 
04:27:20.870 --> 04:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee but
 
04:27:20.880 --> 04:27:21.530 align:start position:0%
committee but
um

04:27:21.530 --> 04:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:23.030 --> 04:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's nice to have the
 
04:27:24.769 --> 04:27:24.779 align:start position:0%
formality of the legislative approval
 
04:27:28.130 --> 04:27:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:30.590 --> 04:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Brennan for the most
 
04:27:33.710 --> 04:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
pointed question about the bill
 
04:27:34.969 --> 04:27:34.979 align:start position:0%
um any other questions from the
 
04:27:34.979 --> 04:27:35.929 align:start position:0%
um any other questions from the
committee

04:27:35.929 --> 04:27:35.939 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:27:35.939 --> 04:27:37.010 align:start position:0%
committee
okay

04:27:37.010 --> 04:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:27:39.170 --> 04:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
um I will say uh I thought this was
 
04:27:40.670 --> 04:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
going to be a slam dunk open close and
 
04:27:42.290 --> 04:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
actually uh proposition it to
 
04:27:43.969 --> 04:27:43.979 align:start position:0%
representative Lane to execute
 
04:27:45.410 --> 04:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
immediately clearly there is more
 
04:27:47.149 --> 04:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
interest than I thought so we are going
 
04:27:49.670 --> 04:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
to not do that for sure and close the
 
04:27:52.429 --> 04:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
hearing on um I'm sorry
 
04:27:53.990 --> 04:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
oh we're gonna do the blue sheet thank
 
04:28:31.189 --> 04:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:31.199 --> 04:28:32.929 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:28:32.929 --> 04:28:32.939 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:28:36.290 --> 04:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
um on House Bill 259 there were
 
04:28:38.510 --> 04:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
um four people signed up as opposed and
 
04:28:43.490 --> 04:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:46.189 --> 04:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
now I will close the hearing on a house
 
04:28:49.070 --> 04:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
bill 259 and I will open the public
 
04:28:51.290 --> 04:28:51.300 align:start position:0%

04:30:51.229 --> 04:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh we'll start with Liz tantarelli
 
04:30:53.389 --> 04:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
mostly because I haven't seen you yet I
 
04:30:54.830 --> 04:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
think this legislative cycle Miss chance
 
04:30:59.990 --> 04:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:02.389 --> 04:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Barry it's yes
 
04:31:04.490 --> 04:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
I I haven't been here testifying yet
 
04:31:07.790 --> 04:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
whoops untangle myself
 
04:31:11.269 --> 04:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Liz tantarelli I'm
 
04:31:13.490 --> 04:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
president of the non-partisan League of
 
04:31:16.610 --> 04:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
Women Voters and I did speak with the
 
04:31:19.010 --> 04:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
sponsor about this bill several weeks
 
04:31:19.020 --> 04:31:19.849 align:start position:0%
sponsor about this bill several weeks
ago

04:31:19.849 --> 04:31:19.859 align:start position:0%
ago
 
04:31:24.250 --> 04:31:24.260 align:start position:0%
uh and in fact I can't contacted him
 
04:31:29.330 --> 04:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
because in Fall of 2022 as you know we
 
04:31:32.030 --> 04:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
had two Constitution two ballot
 
04:31:32.040 --> 04:31:33.290 align:start position:0%
had two Constitution two ballot
questions

04:31:33.290 --> 04:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:31:36.050 --> 04:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
and there was great confusion among the
 
04:31:38.570 --> 04:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
public about what the heck these meant
 
04:31:41.570 --> 04:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
the League of Women Voters goal is to
 
04:31:44.210 --> 04:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
empower voters and therefore we took it
 
04:31:46.189 --> 04:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
upon ourselves
 
04:31:49.849 --> 04:31:49.859 align:start position:0%
to write an explanation of each of the
 
04:31:53.630 --> 04:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
ballot questions to disseminate that via
 
04:31:56.149 --> 04:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
email to our members and friends and
 
04:31:59.630 --> 04:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
supporters via social media via paper
 
04:32:02.689 --> 04:32:02.699 align:start position:0%
copy at candidate forums in any way we
 
04:32:06.830 --> 04:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
could do this we sent them out to groups
 
04:32:10.189 --> 04:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
that requested it and so on
 
04:32:13.070 --> 04:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
um recently all those extra copies of
 
04:32:15.649 --> 04:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
that went into the recycling bin but I
 
04:32:17.689 --> 04:32:17.699 align:start position:0%
had one left which I've given to the
 
04:32:17.699 --> 04:32:18.649 align:start position:0%
had one left which I've given to the
clerk

04:32:18.649 --> 04:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
04:32:21.649 --> 04:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
so I you know if you want to see how we
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
did a neutral explanation of those two
 
04:32:27.469 --> 04:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
questions you can
 
04:32:30.469 --> 04:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
now we did that because we feel that is
 
04:32:33.790 --> 04:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
our work to empower voters to understand
 
04:32:37.969 --> 04:32:37.979 align:start position:0%
what they're voting for it's in the same
 
04:32:40.670 --> 04:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
spirit in which we conduct candidate
 
04:32:43.070 --> 04:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
forums meet the candidates so you know
 
04:32:45.410 --> 04:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
whom you're voting for
 
04:32:48.590 --> 04:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
I we reached a small fraction of the
 
04:32:50.929 --> 04:32:50.939 align:start position:0%
voters let's let's be honest
 
04:32:53.689 --> 04:32:53.699 align:start position:0%
people were emailing me asking me
 
04:32:55.670 --> 04:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
questions you know people I didn't know
 
04:32:57.729 --> 04:32:57.739 align:start position:0%
were emailing the league with questions
 
04:33:01.309 --> 04:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
but still it was a small fraction I
 
04:33:03.950 --> 04:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
believe this is a good Bill I'm speaking
 
04:33:07.090 --> 04:33:07.100 align:start position:0%
in support of it to have an explanation
 
04:33:12.470 --> 04:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
of the question right on the ballot
 
04:33:16.849 --> 04:33:16.859 align:start position:0%
um and it could be written um
 
04:33:19.429 --> 04:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
very simply it should be written very
 
04:33:21.070 --> 04:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
simply frankly
 
04:33:25.029 --> 04:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
for instance the registrar probate thing
 
04:33:28.131 --> 04:33:28.141 align:start position:0%
had every reference to the registrar
 
04:33:30.289 --> 04:33:30.299 align:start position:0%
probate deleted because that's that's
 
04:33:32.689 --> 04:33:32.699 align:start position:0%
your law right now
 
04:33:35.929 --> 04:33:35.939 align:start position:0%
um so in my explanation I showed it the
 
04:33:38.631 --> 04:33:38.641 align:start position:0%
way you legislators saw it when it was
 
04:33:41.150 --> 04:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
passed last year that is as a
 
04:33:43.551 --> 04:33:43.561 align:start position:0%
strikethrough of the phrase register of
 
04:33:43.561 --> 04:33:44.810 align:start position:0%
strikethrough of the phrase register of
probate

04:33:44.810 --> 04:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
probate
 
04:33:47.150 --> 04:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
which made a lot more sense now you know
 
04:33:48.830 --> 04:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
what you're voting for you're voting to
 
04:33:51.650 --> 04:33:51.660 align:start position:0%
get rid of that position
 
04:33:54.890 --> 04:33:54.900 align:start position:0%
anyway back back to this bill I do
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
believe that we should have those kinds
 
04:34:01.551 --> 04:34:01.561 align:start position:0%
of explanations right on the ballot I
 
04:34:04.010 --> 04:34:04.020 align:start position:0%
disagree with the sponsor and I tried to
 
04:34:05.689 --> 04:34:05.699 align:start position:0%
call him over the weekend and didn't
 
04:34:08.330 --> 04:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
reach him to see if he'd amend it I
 
04:34:11.330 --> 04:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
disagree that the text of that
 
04:34:13.551 --> 04:34:13.561 align:start position:0%
explanation should be written by gel
 
04:34:16.250 --> 04:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
Carr I think that should be written by
 
04:34:18.709 --> 04:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State a completely
 
04:34:22.490 --> 04:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
neutral party in the elections but I do
 
04:34:26.029 --> 04:34:26.039 align:start position:0%
believe the voters need and deserve
 
04:34:28.310 --> 04:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
explanations and that's why the league
 
04:34:31.010 --> 04:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
supports this and if you don't pass this
 
04:34:33.529 --> 04:34:33.539 align:start position:0%
bill and we get another Constitutional
 
04:34:35.330 --> 04:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
Amendment on the ballot we'll do the
 
04:34:37.429 --> 04:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
same thing we did in 2020 we'll write
 
04:34:40.670 --> 04:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
our own explanation and try to publicize
 
04:34:43.609 --> 04:34:43.619 align:start position:0%
it but we won't reach nearly the number
 
04:34:47.330 --> 04:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
that we could if you pass this bill I'd
 
04:34:49.369 --> 04:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
be glad to answer questions if there are
 
04:34:53.209 --> 04:34:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:57.650 --> 04:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:58.849 --> 04:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
representative can you turn your
 
04:35:01.070 --> 04:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
microphone on
 
04:35:03.709 --> 04:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
thank you I agree with you that first
 
04:35:06.590 --> 04:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
one would have been much easier if we
 
04:35:08.570 --> 04:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
followed what we do here and do a
 
04:35:10.070 --> 04:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
strikethrough I'm a little nervous about
 
04:35:13.250 --> 04:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
the explanation because some of these
 
04:35:17.209 --> 04:35:17.219 align:start position:0%
things get pretty wordy and to make them
 
04:35:20.209 --> 04:35:20.219 align:start position:0%
completely neutral is very difficult to
 
04:35:24.590 --> 04:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
do in my opinion but um so my concern
 
04:35:27.369 --> 04:35:27.379 align:start position:0%
here and you can representative
 
04:35:30.289 --> 04:35:30.299 align:start position:0%
we have to uh are you I hate to be that
 
04:35:31.670 --> 04:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
guy because especially people know I I
 
04:35:33.289 --> 04:35:33.299 align:start position:0%
love a good back and forth but we have
 
04:35:35.090 --> 04:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
to ask a question in the hearing in the
 
04:35:37.070 --> 04:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
interest of fairness what is your
 
04:35:38.390 --> 04:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
consent I'm sorry
 
04:35:41.090 --> 04:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chair what is your concern about how
 
04:35:43.310 --> 04:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
thorough the explanation needs to be
 
04:35:45.890 --> 04:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
away okay
 
04:35:48.349 --> 04:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
um the the copy that I gave to the clerk
 
04:35:50.810 --> 04:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
I think we went overboard in our
 
04:35:50.820 --> 04:35:52.250 align:start position:0%
I think we went overboard in our
explanation

04:35:52.250 --> 04:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
04:35:55.910 --> 04:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
and when I posted it on social media I
 
04:35:59.269 --> 04:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
simplified it and I said that that first
 
04:36:02.929 --> 04:36:02.939 align:start position:0%
question for instance would take the
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
position of register of probate out of
 
04:36:08.631 --> 04:36:08.641 align:start position:0%
the Constitution because it is a
 
04:36:11.150 --> 04:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
position which no longer has any duties
 
04:36:13.310 --> 04:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
and the only way that can be done is
 
04:36:16.429 --> 04:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
through a constitutional amendment that
 
04:36:19.609 --> 04:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
that would have been perfectly fine so
 
04:36:23.230 --> 04:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
when we have cut any controversial
 
04:36:25.490 --> 04:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment and yes I've
 
04:36:28.490 --> 04:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
looked at the cacrs for this year
 
04:36:32.449 --> 04:36:32.459 align:start position:0%
okay we're in for a fun ride with those
 
04:36:32.459 --> 04:36:34.730 align:start position:0%
okay we're in for a fun ride with those
um

04:36:34.730 --> 04:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
I don't think it should be gel car that
 
04:36:40.189 --> 04:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
is writing that because you you have
 
04:36:43.070 --> 04:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
partisan views there that's why I
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
suggest that this be amended so that the
 
04:36:48.230 --> 04:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
secretary of state will write it as
 
04:36:50.570 --> 04:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
simply as briefly and as neutrally as
 
04:36:52.970 --> 04:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
possible I hope that answered your
 
04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
04:36:57.109 --> 04:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
follow-up did you have you recommended I
 
04:36:58.429 --> 04:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
think you said about just to be clear
 
04:37:00.170 --> 04:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
have you made that recommendation to the
 
04:37:03.170 --> 04:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
sponsor I I couldn't reach him over the
 
04:37:05.750 --> 04:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
weekend and I'm I'm not sure why and I'm
 
04:37:08.449 --> 04:37:08.459 align:start position:0%
not sure why he's not here that was my
 
04:37:11.269 --> 04:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
intention to recommend it to him that
 
04:37:12.769 --> 04:37:12.779 align:start position:0%
that did answer my question thank you so
 
04:37:14.929 --> 04:37:14.939 align:start position:0%
much thank you representative wooden I
 
04:37:16.730 --> 04:37:16.740 align:start position:0%
hope we're still friends representative
 
04:37:16.740 --> 04:37:17.990 align:start position:0%
hope we're still friends representative
Bay

04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
Bay
 
04:37:21.230 --> 04:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for and thank you for
 
04:37:23.631 --> 04:37:23.641 align:start position:0%
taking my question good to see you
 
04:37:26.510 --> 04:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
um so what is
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
um the downside to uh just um keeping it
 
04:37:33.949 --> 04:37:33.959 align:start position:0%
as is where uh non-partisan groups such
 
04:37:35.929 --> 04:37:35.939 align:start position:0%
as the League of Women Voters provide
 
04:37:39.170 --> 04:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
that information I'd love to thank you
 
04:37:41.150 --> 04:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
for that question and I love your
 
04:37:43.131 --> 04:37:43.141 align:start position:0%
confidence in us that we could reach a
 
04:37:46.609 --> 04:37:46.619 align:start position:0%
lot of Voters we can't it needs to be on
 
04:37:48.650 --> 04:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
the ballot there are certainly people
 
04:37:48.660 --> 04:37:49.869 align:start position:0%
the ballot there are certainly people
who

04:37:49.869 --> 04:37:49.879 align:start position:0%
who
 
04:37:52.970 --> 04:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
missed any newspaper reference to this
 
04:37:55.310 --> 04:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
missed our social media missed our
 
04:37:57.830 --> 04:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
handouts we're there in the polling
 
04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
place and had no understanding of either
 
04:38:02.510 --> 04:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
of the questions and whether their yes
 
04:38:04.730 --> 04:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
or no votes mattered and what they
 
04:38:06.250 --> 04:38:06.260 align:start position:0%
should do
 
04:38:11.929 --> 04:38:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:14.330 --> 04:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:38:16.070 --> 04:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none and it's good seeing
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
you again miss tantarelli thank you
 
04:38:21.769 --> 04:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
representative Barry next up uh Roy I
 
04:38:23.390 --> 04:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to butcher this last name so I
 
04:38:26.689 --> 04:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
apologize uh shwake swaker you're gonna
 
04:38:32.510 --> 04:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:34.789 --> 04:38:34.799 align:start position:0%
Pat schweiker is Germanic it's like
 
04:38:36.830 --> 04:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
schweitz and other German names you
 
04:38:38.209 --> 04:38:38.219 align:start position:0%
pronounce the second letter instead of
 
04:38:40.490 --> 04:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
the first but anyway yes I'm Roy
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
schweiker from Concord and she actually
 
04:38:44.449 --> 04:38:44.459 align:start position:0%
stole a lot of my thunder
 
04:38:44.459 --> 04:38:45.650 align:start position:0%
stole a lot of my thunder
because

04:38:45.650 --> 04:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:38:47.570 --> 04:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
I felt the same way about the
 
04:38:50.390 --> 04:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment thing that you
 
04:38:52.070 --> 04:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
know it didn't really say anything it
 
04:38:53.750 --> 04:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
was made worse by the Concord Monitor
 
04:38:55.730 --> 04:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
the day before the election said the
 
04:38:57.230 --> 04:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
effect of this amendment would be remove
 
04:38:59.929 --> 04:38:59.939 align:start position:0%
the register of deeds
 
04:38:59.939 --> 04:39:03.890 align:start position:0%
the register of deeds
so

04:39:03.890 --> 04:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:06.830 --> 04:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
so you know the I I agree with what she
 
04:39:09.051 --> 04:39:09.061 align:start position:0%
said in terms of we should have an
 
04:39:11.090 --> 04:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
explanation it should be on the ballot
 
04:39:14.029 --> 04:39:14.039 align:start position:0%
and more importantly and once again it
 
04:39:16.670 --> 04:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
sort of says this here but not quite the
 
04:39:18.590 --> 04:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
amendment should say what will change
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
what the impact of this is is compared
 
04:39:24.170 --> 04:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
to what will happen afterward because
 
04:39:27.349 --> 04:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
what was presented was correct after how
 
04:39:28.910 --> 04:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
it happened only if only a certain
 
04:39:30.830 --> 04:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
offices would appear in the Constitution
 
04:39:33.949 --> 04:39:33.959 align:start position:0%
but it didn't say that the impact of
 
04:39:35.929 --> 04:39:35.939 align:start position:0%
this is you'd be removing a presently
 
04:39:39.050 --> 04:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
existing office so I think that that's
 
04:39:40.550 --> 04:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
the second important thing is that you
 
04:39:42.288 --> 04:39:42.298 align:start position:0%
need to show what's changing and not
 
04:39:43.970 --> 04:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
just what the result is
 
04:39:47.448 --> 04:39:47.458 align:start position:0%
and I have a second story here the
 
04:39:49.550 --> 04:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
Concord School District had a charter
 
04:39:51.230 --> 04:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
commission last time through
 
04:39:54.470 --> 04:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
and they decided on their own that they
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to eliminate the uh requirement
 
04:39:59.150 --> 04:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
the charter commission candidates file
 
04:40:02.630 --> 04:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance requirements and also
 
04:40:04.430 --> 04:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
the requirement that they'd be elected
 
04:40:06.650 --> 04:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
by Awards instead of at Large
 
04:40:07.970 --> 04:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
so they
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
they had an amendment to the Charter
 
04:40:12.050 --> 04:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
that would do those two things but once
 
04:40:13.910 --> 04:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
again they did not say in the
 
04:40:15.708 --> 04:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
explanation that we're going to
 
04:40:17.208 --> 04:40:17.218 align:start position:0%
eliminate the campaign Finance
 
04:40:19.250 --> 04:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
requirement we're going to change to our
 
04:40:21.650 --> 04:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
large voting they just said what the
 
04:40:23.930 --> 04:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
result was so most people who voted on
 
04:40:26.868 --> 04:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
it had no clue what was actually taking
 
04:40:29.270 --> 04:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
place in this thing so that's once again
 
04:40:31.670 --> 04:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
an example of why it's very important
 
04:40:34.490 --> 04:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
that the requirement for the explanation
 
04:40:36.890 --> 04:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
show what the change is and not what the
 
04:40:38.030 --> 04:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
result is
 
04:40:41.208 --> 04:40:41.218 align:start position:0%
and lastly to get to the last topic here
 
04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
I think the joint legislative committee
 
04:40:45.110 --> 04:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
on administrative rules maybe should
 
04:40:47.208 --> 04:40:47.218 align:start position:0%
approve the text I mean the people that
 
04:40:49.190 --> 04:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
came up with it originally you know
 
04:40:51.230 --> 04:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
maybe know what it should be but the
 
04:40:52.970 --> 04:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
joint committee on rules you know could
 
04:40:54.708 --> 04:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
look at it and see is this like the
 
04:40:56.150 --> 04:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
charter commission they're trying to
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
hide something we need to fix this and
 
04:41:00.350 --> 04:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
the other thing that came up with the
 
04:41:02.630 --> 04:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
charter commission is the only appeal
 
04:41:05.150 --> 04:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
was to the Superior Court you could
 
04:41:06.530 --> 04:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
appeal to the superior court if you
 
04:41:08.150 --> 04:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
didn't like it that's probably not
 
04:41:09.410 --> 04:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
something they have a great deal of
 
04:41:11.750 --> 04:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
expertise in and gosh knows when they
 
04:41:12.770 --> 04:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
would have had a hearing you know maybe
 
04:41:14.690 --> 04:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
two or three years from now after the
 
04:41:17.470 --> 04:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
Amendments already end so I think that
 
04:41:20.090 --> 04:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
the correct thing to do may be to do
 
04:41:20.100 --> 04:41:21.170 align:start position:0%
the correct thing to do may be to do
this

04:41:21.170 --> 04:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:41:23.690 --> 04:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
that whoever writes the amendment
 
04:41:26.030 --> 04:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
provides the explanation but the
 
04:41:28.070 --> 04:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
committee on legislative rules gets to
 
04:41:30.050 --> 04:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
review it and object if they don't like
 
04:41:32.208 --> 04:41:32.218 align:start position:0%
it and the Secretary of State who
 
04:41:33.830 --> 04:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
actually is our top election official
 
04:41:36.288 --> 04:41:36.298 align:start position:0%
and if he can set the primary date he
 
04:41:38.030 --> 04:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
got to be able to be the final decision
 
04:41:40.010 --> 04:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
on you know whether the explanation is
 
04:41:40.020 --> 04:41:40.910 align:start position:0%
on you know whether the explanation is
correct

04:41:40.910 --> 04:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:41:42.670 --> 04:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
and the last thing I want to say
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
extending what she has said is this just
 
04:41:48.670 --> 04:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
says that if the legislature or whatever
 
04:41:52.490 --> 04:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
proposes the change that this
 
04:41:54.470 --> 04:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
explanation has to meet this requirement
 
04:41:57.230 --> 04:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
but if it comes by a constitutional
 
04:41:59.330 --> 04:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
commission they don't you don't have to
 
04:42:01.190 --> 04:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
go through this I think the change
 
04:42:03.470 --> 04:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
should be the same for everybody that
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional commission may write
 
04:42:08.208 --> 04:42:08.218 align:start position:0%
an explanation but it should be subject
 
04:42:09.948 --> 04:42:09.958 align:start position:0%
to review by
 
04:42:11.930 --> 04:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
administrative rules if you want to and
 
04:42:14.208 --> 04:42:14.218 align:start position:0%
certainly the Secretary of State can
 
04:42:16.128 --> 04:42:16.138 align:start position:0%
make the final determination of this is
 
04:42:17.628 --> 04:42:17.638 align:start position:0%
this a fair
 
04:42:20.270 --> 04:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
you know explanation that explains
 
04:42:22.010 --> 04:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
what's actually changing rather than
 
04:42:24.110 --> 04:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
you're trying to hide something and then
 
04:42:26.330 --> 04:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
I'll make one more last thing and that
 
04:42:28.190 --> 04:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
is why is this only true for
 
04:42:30.110 --> 04:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendments why isn't it
 
04:42:31.910 --> 04:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
true for any such change why don't we
 
04:42:34.430 --> 04:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
make Charter commissions subject to if
 
04:42:37.128 --> 04:42:37.138 align:start position:0%
they propose an explanation that's not
 
04:42:39.170 --> 04:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
you know full and correct that the
 
04:42:41.448 --> 04:42:41.458 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State can change it and you
 
04:42:43.490 --> 04:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
and if somebody a voter doesn't like the
 
04:42:45.470 --> 04:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
explanation they appeal to the Secretary
 
04:42:47.030 --> 04:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
of State who can actually affect the
 
04:42:48.770 --> 04:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
ballot rather than paying several
 
04:42:50.930 --> 04:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars to get the Superior
 
04:42:52.550 --> 04:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
Court to rule on it three years from now
 
04:42:54.170 --> 04:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:42:57.050 --> 04:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
04:42:59.810 --> 04:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
04:43:02.570 --> 04:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
next up Mary till also from Concord
 
04:43:13.490 --> 04:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:15.948 --> 04:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair and committee
 
04:43:15.958 --> 04:43:17.448 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair and committee
members

04:43:17.448 --> 04:43:17.458 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:43:19.430 --> 04:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
um my name is Mary Chill and I'm from
 
04:43:22.970 --> 04:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
Concord as you pointed out and I am
 
04:43:26.930 --> 04:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
rising in favor of this bill actually I
 
04:43:29.590 --> 04:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
worked with representative Smith in
 
04:43:33.350 --> 04:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
writing this bill and I have a couple of
 
04:43:36.170 --> 04:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
comments related to that but first of
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
all let's talk about my motivation in
 
04:43:41.448 --> 04:43:41.458 align:start position:0%
wanting in the bill to be written and I
 
04:43:44.330 --> 04:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
agree pretty much with what the previous
 
04:43:47.570 --> 04:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
speakers have said I used to be a town
 
04:43:50.628 --> 04:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
moderator in Dairy until 2020 and so a
 
04:43:52.850 --> 04:43:52.860 align:start position:0%
lot of people looked to me when it came
 
04:43:55.730 --> 04:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
to election questions and I got lots of
 
04:43:58.010 --> 04:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
calls from people saying what's going on
 
04:43:59.868 --> 04:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
with these amendments especially that
 
04:44:01.570 --> 04:44:01.580 align:start position:0%
first one
 
04:44:04.730 --> 04:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
in fact one person said you know if you
 
04:44:06.830 --> 04:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
remember the bill there was a section
 
04:44:10.730 --> 04:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
71a and a section 71 B e both of which
 
04:44:13.310 --> 04:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
just removed the rep the Registrar of
 
04:44:16.550 --> 04:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
probate from the Constitution and they
 
04:44:17.990 --> 04:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
looked at that and they said well I want
 
04:44:21.310 --> 04:44:21.320 align:start position:0%
to vote no on 71a but I want to vote Yes
 
04:44:25.970 --> 04:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
171b you know how do I vote and uh
 
04:44:28.610 --> 04:44:28.620 align:start position:0%
so I you know explained to them
 
04:44:28.620 --> 04:44:29.930 align:start position:0%
so I you know explained to them
how

04:44:29.930 --> 04:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:44:32.030 --> 04:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
um I mean what was really going on with
 
04:44:34.430 --> 04:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment but when I got the first
 
04:44:36.590 --> 04:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
call it it happened to go to my
 
04:44:39.830 --> 04:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
voicemail so uh somebody was saying you
 
04:44:41.628 --> 04:44:41.638 align:start position:0%
know explain to me what's happening on
 
04:44:44.930 --> 04:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
this amendment and I thought well okay
 
04:44:46.610 --> 04:44:46.620 align:start position:0%
I'm going to read it because I hadn't
 
04:44:48.230 --> 04:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
read it I'd heard that there was going
 
04:44:50.030 --> 04:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
to be an amendment to remove the
 
04:44:51.770 --> 04:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
Registrar of probate
 
04:44:56.990 --> 04:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
so I went uh I went to the sample ballot
 
04:44:58.730 --> 04:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
that I had and I read the Constitutional
 
04:45:00.770 --> 04:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I said I don't know what
 
04:45:02.510 --> 04:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
this one's all about doesn't say
 
04:45:05.270 --> 04:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
anything about registrar probate but
 
04:45:08.510 --> 04:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
luckily I had a a handy dandy copy of
 
04:45:10.910 --> 04:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution so I
 
04:45:12.890 --> 04:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
pulled it out and I read the relevant
 
04:45:16.250 --> 04:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
sections and realized what they had done
 
04:45:18.350 --> 04:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
so when I called the people back and
 
04:45:21.470 --> 04:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
explained that they they were satisfied
 
04:45:25.430 --> 04:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
but my concern is although I'm glad they
 
04:45:27.948 --> 04:45:27.958 align:start position:0%
trust me I really don't think that
 
04:45:29.628 --> 04:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
voters should have to trust somebody
 
04:45:32.810 --> 04:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
they know to understand how they're
 
04:45:36.070 --> 04:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
voting and so that's when I went to
 
04:45:38.990 --> 04:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt and said we need
 
04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
to put an explanation on the ballot of
 
04:45:45.470 --> 04:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
what these amendments mean I know from
 
04:45:47.990 --> 04:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
town politics that when they put out a
 
04:45:49.910 --> 04:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
Warren article they do put an
 
04:45:52.430 --> 04:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
explanation of what the warrant is all
 
04:45:55.490 --> 04:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
about and so I didn't understand why it
 
04:45:57.050 --> 04:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
wasn't happening for the with the New
 
04:45:58.730 --> 04:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution
 
04:46:01.030 --> 04:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
the other thing is
 
04:46:04.368 --> 04:46:04.378 align:start position:0%
after the bill was submitted I started
 
04:46:07.250 --> 04:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
hearing lots of talk about who's writing
 
04:46:10.610 --> 04:46:10.620 align:start position:0%
this explanation in fact the the
 
04:46:13.730 --> 04:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
analysis of the bill says it changes the
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
process of drafting voter guides for
 
04:46:18.170 --> 04:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendments well that was
 
04:46:20.448 --> 04:46:20.458 align:start position:0%
never the intention it has nothing we
 
04:46:23.690 --> 04:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
don't care who writes these explanations
 
04:46:23.700 --> 04:46:25.670 align:start position:0%
don't care who writes these explanations
so

04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:28.610 --> 04:46:28.620 align:start position:0%
um Senator representative Schmidt and I
 
04:46:30.410 --> 04:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
got together over the weekend I don't
 
04:46:32.990 --> 04:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
know if he was able to offer an
 
04:46:34.910 --> 04:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
amendment but we did come up with an
 
04:46:38.470 --> 04:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that basically leaves
 
04:46:42.948 --> 04:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
663 colon 3 hyphen a which talks about
 
04:46:44.890 --> 04:46:44.900 align:start position:0%
how this
 
04:46:49.190 --> 04:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
this explanation is included in the C
 
04:46:49.200 --> 04:46:51.050 align:start position:0%
this explanation is included in the C
cacr

04:46:51.050 --> 04:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
cacr
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
and then it is you know taken from there
 
04:46:57.650 --> 04:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
and the explanation is
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
given to the Secretary of State who puts
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
it in the voter's guide that's fine so
 
04:47:04.250 --> 04:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we're going to
 
04:47:07.128 --> 04:47:07.138 align:start position:0%
propose will simply not touch
 
04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
part A which talks about who's going to
 
04:47:12.530 --> 04:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
write it we'll do it the way we're doing
 
04:47:15.170 --> 04:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
it right now it adds a new section that
 
04:47:17.628 --> 04:47:17.638 align:start position:0%
says the text of the statement for the
 
04:47:19.070 --> 04:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
voter's guide and the resolution
 
04:47:21.170 --> 04:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
proposing the Constitutional Amendment
 
04:47:26.090 --> 04:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
as described in RSA 663 colon 3 hyphen a
 
04:47:28.550 --> 04:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
shall be printed on the election day
 
04:47:30.410 --> 04:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
ballot immediately beneath the
 
04:47:32.270 --> 04:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
Constitutional question to which it
 
04:47:34.430 --> 04:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
applies so that
 
04:47:36.650 --> 04:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
gets rid of all of the discussion about
 
04:47:38.990 --> 04:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
who's going to write it we're not trying
 
04:47:40.490 --> 04:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
to deal with that question now somebody
 
04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
can put in another another bill if you
 
04:47:45.650 --> 04:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
want to do that but this bill is just to
 
04:47:47.750 --> 04:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
talk about getting an explanation on the
 
04:47:49.730 --> 04:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
ballot so I'll be happy to answer any
 
04:47:49.740 --> 04:47:50.930 align:start position:0%
ballot so I'll be happy to answer any
questions

04:47:50.930 --> 04:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:47:55.310 --> 04:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:58.810 --> 04:47:58.820 align:start position:0%
easy enough thank you Miss till
 
04:48:03.310 --> 04:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
next up Carol oh Lord uh
 
04:48:06.410 --> 04:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you also from Concord once again
 
04:48:08.150 --> 04:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
conquered extremely Representatives
 
04:48:08.160 --> 04:48:10.090 align:start position:0%
conquered extremely Representatives
today

04:48:10.090 --> 04:48:10.100 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:48:18.050 --> 04:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:20.810 --> 04:48:20.820 align:start position:0%
I am Carol canarium and
 
04:48:23.330 --> 04:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
Anna come and talk to you today
 
04:48:25.250 --> 04:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
um I have a master's degree and I'm
 
04:48:28.550 --> 04:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
reasonably intelligent but when I go
 
04:48:32.030 --> 04:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
into the polls I often do not understand
 
04:48:35.868 --> 04:48:35.878 align:start position:0%
the question or if I understand the
 
04:48:38.690 --> 04:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
question sometimes I just don't quite
 
04:48:42.830 --> 04:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
know whether voting yes is agreeing or
 
04:48:45.590 --> 04:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
voting yes is not agreeing
 
04:48:45.600 --> 04:48:47.150 align:start position:0%
voting yes is not agreeing
so

04:48:47.150 --> 04:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:50.628 --> 04:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
um when I went to the polls in November
 
04:48:54.948 --> 04:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
and I I had read in the in the monitor
 
04:48:58.490 --> 04:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
about the bills and of the questions and
 
04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
I was pretty clear that I knew but there
 
04:49:05.448 --> 04:49:05.458 align:start position:0%
was no mention of probate in that
 
04:49:08.810 --> 04:49:08.820 align:start position:0%
question it was and other people that I
 
04:49:11.628 --> 04:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
talked to just didn't understand it at
 
04:49:15.708 --> 04:49:15.718 align:start position:0%
all and they too reported that they
 
04:49:19.730 --> 04:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
often didn't understand questions or
 
04:49:22.970 --> 04:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
that they were confused about how to
 
04:49:26.810 --> 04:49:26.820 align:start position:0%
answer it so I thought oh this has to
 
04:49:30.288 --> 04:49:30.298 align:start position:0%
change so I am just delighted to have
 
04:49:32.150 --> 04:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:49:34.970 --> 04:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
um I think it's really important for
 
04:49:38.330 --> 04:49:38.340 align:start position:0%
voters to have clear statements about
 
04:49:41.868 --> 04:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
what the bill is and how when you vote
 
04:49:44.868 --> 04:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
that you know that you're voting it the
 
04:49:47.030 --> 04:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
way you really believe you should vote
 
04:49:51.288 --> 04:49:51.298 align:start position:0%
it and I think if we wrote that bill so
 
04:49:53.930 --> 04:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
that a fifth grader could understand it
 
04:49:57.230 --> 04:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
and tell me what's in it that would be
 
04:49:57.240 --> 04:49:58.610 align:start position:0%
and tell me what's in it that would be
wonderful

04:49:58.610 --> 04:49:58.620 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
04:50:02.690 --> 04:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
so I think really and truly it should be
 
04:50:05.208 --> 04:50:05.218 align:start position:0%
on the ballot and I think if the
 
04:50:07.250 --> 04:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
question has to be in some legal
 
04:50:09.770 --> 04:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
language that's fine but underneath
 
04:50:13.310 --> 04:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
there should be a place for voters who
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
are not legal people and they could know
 
04:50:19.490 --> 04:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
what they're voting for
 
04:50:22.490 --> 04:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much I am very happy
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
to be talking to you actually not many
 
04:50:27.770 --> 04:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
people say that
 
04:50:30.530 --> 04:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:50:33.050 --> 04:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you
 
04:50:35.628 --> 04:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
um last pink card we have is from the
 
04:50:37.010 --> 04:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office deputy
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:43.310 --> 04:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
04:50:46.190 --> 04:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
committee good to see all of you again
 
04:50:48.170 --> 04:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
um I have not seen the proposed
 
04:50:49.850 --> 04:50:49.860 align:start position:0%
amendment that the last speaker was
 
04:50:52.128 --> 04:50:52.138 align:start position:0%
talking to but just bringing up a couple
 
04:50:53.990 --> 04:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
of points that other people have spoken
 
04:50:55.030 --> 04:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
to already
 
04:50:57.770 --> 04:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
Not only was the two questions
 
04:50:59.810 --> 04:50:59.820 align:start position:0%
especially one of them very confusing
 
04:51:01.610 --> 04:51:01.620 align:start position:0%
for some of our voters this past year
 
04:51:05.090 --> 04:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
the actual voters guide was confusing as
 
04:51:07.310 --> 04:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
well and we did get a few angry phone
 
04:51:08.930 --> 04:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
calls to the Secretary of State's office
 
04:51:11.150 --> 04:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
since we do print that and distribute it
 
04:51:13.250 --> 04:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
to your town election officials we put
 
04:51:15.230 --> 04:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
it up on our website but we can only
 
04:51:15.240 --> 04:51:16.670 align:start position:0%
it up on our website but we can only
print

04:51:16.670 --> 04:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
print
 
04:51:19.010 --> 04:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
currently what it says that we can print
 
04:51:22.070 --> 04:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
so we don't have any way to make that a
 
04:51:23.510 --> 04:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
little bit clearer to what the voter's
 
04:51:25.310 --> 04:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
doing so
 
04:51:27.530 --> 04:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure what the amendment does
 
04:51:31.368 --> 04:51:31.378 align:start position:0%
but looking at this a a new process just
 
04:51:33.470 --> 04:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that voters guide is
 
04:51:37.730 --> 04:51:37.740 align:start position:0%
clearer would be recommended by myself I
 
04:51:39.708 --> 04:51:39.718 align:start position:0%
think that that can be worked on just to
 
04:51:41.570 --> 04:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
make sure that whatever is given to the
 
04:51:43.190 --> 04:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
voter they have they do understand what
 
04:51:45.410 --> 04:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
they're what they're voting on
 
04:51:47.030 --> 04:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
um the other the other thing that this
 
04:51:49.128 --> 04:51:49.138 align:start position:0%
bill currently does is that it prints
 
04:51:51.410 --> 04:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
that voter's guide on the ballot and we
 
04:51:53.270 --> 04:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
don't do that right now if you were in
 
04:51:56.090 --> 04:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
your polling location in November you
 
04:51:58.310 --> 04:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
may have seen the voter's guide for the
 
04:52:00.230 --> 04:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
questions or if you had an absentee
 
04:52:01.550 --> 04:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
ballot you may have gotten one in the
 
04:52:01.560 --> 04:52:02.708 align:start position:0%
ballot you may have gotten one in the
mail

04:52:02.708 --> 04:52:02.718 align:start position:0%

04:52:05.090 --> 04:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
putting the voter guide on the question
 
04:52:08.030 --> 04:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
I just want to make you aware would make
 
04:52:10.670 --> 04:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
the ballot longer possibly because it
 
04:52:12.650 --> 04:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
would add a lot more language to the
 
04:52:15.830 --> 04:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
bill so however the committee decides to
 
04:52:17.570 --> 04:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
address this bill I just want to make
 
04:52:20.330 --> 04:52:20.340 align:start position:0%
you aware of that possible ballot a
 
04:52:24.410 --> 04:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
bigger Ballot or a more expensive ballot
 
04:52:26.390 --> 04:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
process process
 
04:52:28.368 --> 04:52:28.378 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say Okay questions
 
04:52:30.770 --> 04:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative wood
 
04:52:33.050 --> 04:52:33.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:52:34.970 --> 04:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
um what are what are the legal
 
04:52:36.650 --> 04:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
restrictions you mentioned that you're
 
04:52:38.510 --> 04:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
confined now about legal restrictions
 
04:52:40.310 --> 04:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
what you could put on the ballot is that
 
04:52:42.530 --> 04:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
something you could just say quickly yes
 
04:52:44.390 --> 04:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the bill in front of
 
04:52:47.390 --> 04:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
you and you take out all of the strikes
 
04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
and all of the bolds that's what the
 
04:52:50.810 --> 04:52:50.820 align:start position:0%
current law is
 
04:52:54.050 --> 04:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
so we print what the legislation tells
 
04:52:55.730 --> 04:52:55.740 align:start position:0%
us to print
 
04:52:58.128 --> 04:52:58.138 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:52:59.810 --> 04:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
04:53:01.788 --> 04:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
Muirhead thank you
 
04:53:03.770 --> 04:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
um how seriously should we take the
 
04:53:05.448 --> 04:53:05.458 align:start position:0%
longer ballot
 
04:53:08.208 --> 04:53:08.218 align:start position:0%
um concern but you're just off the cuff
 
04:53:11.330 --> 04:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
one might think that a slightly longer
 
04:53:13.310 --> 04:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
ballot that voters can understand is
 
04:53:14.810 --> 04:53:14.820 align:start position:0%
better than a shorter ballot that
 
04:53:16.550 --> 04:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
confuses the heck out of Voters what's
 
04:53:19.850 --> 04:53:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:22.910 --> 04:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
my take is that it's your decision I
 
04:53:23.930 --> 04:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
just wanted to bring it to your
 
04:53:25.730 --> 04:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
attention that it may be a bigger ballot
 
04:53:28.970 --> 04:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
and if there's if there's a lot of
 
04:53:31.010 --> 04:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
candidates on the ballot and the
 
04:53:34.070 --> 04:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
questions get a little bit longer with a
 
04:53:36.170 --> 04:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
little bit longer description and that
 
04:53:39.170 --> 04:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't fit on in an eight and a half by
 
04:53:41.990 --> 04:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
14 or eight and a half by 18 inch ballot
 
04:53:43.910 --> 04:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
there could be two two ballots there
 
04:53:46.368 --> 04:53:46.378 align:start position:0%
could be two pages just
 
04:53:48.310 --> 04:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
it's hard to predict what the new
 
04:53:50.628 --> 04:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
legislatures will bring before us and
 
04:53:52.430 --> 04:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
what could possibly be printed on the
 
04:53:52.440 --> 04:53:54.590 align:start position:0%
what could possibly be printed on the
ballot

04:53:54.590 --> 04:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
04:53:54.600 --> 04:53:55.910 align:start position:0%
ballot
representative

04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:53:58.010 --> 04:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so
 
04:54:00.350 --> 04:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
um piggybacking off of that there's
 
04:54:02.208 --> 04:54:02.218 align:start position:0%
nothing that would prevent us from
 
04:54:05.208 --> 04:54:05.218 align:start position:0%
passing dozens or dozens and dozens of
 
04:54:07.010 --> 04:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh Constitutional Amendments and having
 
04:54:09.050 --> 04:54:09.060 align:start position:0%
them appear on the ballot that's correct
 
04:54:10.670 --> 04:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
the fall
 
04:54:14.150 --> 04:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
follow so in in that case we would in we
 
04:54:15.590 --> 04:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
could potentially encounter a longer
 
04:54:16.910 --> 04:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
ballot anyway
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
that is correct just from term to term
 
04:54:21.948 --> 04:54:21.958 align:start position:0%
yes yep I just again it was just for
 
04:54:25.310 --> 04:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:27.470 --> 04:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:54:30.110 --> 04:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
okay that's it thank you uh deputy
 
04:54:31.970 --> 04:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
secretary can we get the blue sheet see
 
04:54:35.990 --> 04:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:37.730 --> 04:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
and then we're almost playing catch up
 
04:54:47.150 --> 04:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:49.368 --> 04:54:49.378 align:start position:0%
thank you so much there are three people
 
04:54:50.570 --> 04:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
signed in
 
04:54:54.530 --> 04:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
um three in support uh none against two
 
04:54:56.628 --> 04:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
of them spoke so I know the the chairman
 
04:54:58.490 --> 04:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
normally subtracts those two out but
 
04:55:00.830 --> 04:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's okay uh with that I will close
 
04:55:04.150 --> 04:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill
 
04:55:08.150 --> 04:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
395 and I will open the house uh the the
 
04:55:10.310 --> 04:55:10.320 align:start position:0%

affidavit ballots
 
04:55:19.010 --> 04:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe I have a pink card
 
04:55:21.948 --> 04:55:21.958 align:start position:0%
from the sponsor of the submit which
 
04:55:27.770 --> 04:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:27.780 --> 04:55:35.868 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:55:35.868 --> 04:55:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:43.070 --> 04:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:46.368 --> 04:55:46.378 align:start position:0%
that's the sponsor uh yes that is
 
04:55:46.378 --> 04:55:49.128 align:start position:0%
that's the sponsor uh yes that is
perfect

04:55:49.128 --> 04:55:49.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:52.010 --> 04:55:52.020 align:start position:0%

representative

04:55:59.448 --> 04:55:59.458 align:start position:0%

04:56:04.368 --> 04:56:04.378 align:start position:0%
name is Mike EDD you and I do represent
 
04:56:07.788 --> 04:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
Hampton in the New Hampshire house
 
04:56:11.090 --> 04:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
um and thank you uh Mr chairman and
 
04:56:12.590 --> 04:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for allowing me
 
04:56:16.490 --> 04:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
to introduce hb502 to you today
 
04:56:19.070 --> 04:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
this bill repeals last year's
 
04:56:22.970 --> 04:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
legislation that was in SB 418.
 
04:56:25.970 --> 04:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
SB 418 uh you know was a bill that
 
04:56:27.890 --> 04:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
created Hampton excuse me New
 
04:56:30.050 --> 04:56:30.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's first provisional ballot law
 
04:56:32.868 --> 04:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
and in my opinion introduced concern and
 
04:56:35.570 --> 04:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
confusion into the process for elected
 
04:56:37.670 --> 04:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
officials and voters
 
04:56:39.770 --> 04:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
I want to start by saying that I usually
 
04:56:41.510 --> 04:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
do not find myself in front of you you
 
04:56:43.070 --> 04:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
probably haven't seen me in here
 
04:56:44.868 --> 04:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
normally I'm dealing with roads and
 
04:56:47.030 --> 04:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
bridges or something like that
 
04:56:47.040 --> 04:56:47.628 align:start position:0%
bridges or something like that
um

04:56:47.628 --> 04:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:49.788 --> 04:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
but I but I am a veteran and when I
 
04:56:51.708 --> 04:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
learned about how this law had the
 
04:56:54.410 --> 04:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
potential to negatively affect overseas
 
04:56:56.628 --> 04:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
military voters ability to cast a ballot
 
04:56:59.208 --> 04:56:59.218 align:start position:0%
I felt compelled to act and
 
04:57:01.670 --> 04:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
submit this bill
 
04:57:03.708 --> 04:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
last year the committee heard a lot
 
04:57:05.708 --> 04:57:05.718 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
04:57:08.868 --> 04:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
uoca VA or the uniformed overseas
 
04:57:12.350 --> 04:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
citizens absentee boating Act
 
04:57:15.288 --> 04:57:15.298 align:start position:0%
the ACT requires that
 
04:57:18.770 --> 04:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
you owe a c a v a ballots be sent a
 
04:57:21.288 --> 04:57:21.298 align:start position:0%
minimum of 45 days before the general
 
04:57:21.298 --> 04:57:22.310 align:start position:0%
minimum of 45 days before the general
election

04:57:22.310 --> 04:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
election
 
04:57:24.730 --> 04:57:24.740 align:start position:0%
and that's for federal elections
 
04:57:28.788 --> 04:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
SB 418 was written to uh provides a vote
 
04:57:31.070 --> 04:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
of seven days to return proof of
 
04:57:33.890 --> 04:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
identity to have their balance count
 
04:57:36.470 --> 04:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
however it still allows 14 days for the
 
04:57:39.350 --> 04:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
certification of any provisional ballots
 
04:57:39.360 --> 04:57:40.788 align:start position:0%
certification of any provisional ballots
okay

04:57:40.788 --> 04:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:57:43.070 --> 04:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
which is eight short weeks between the
 
04:57:45.590 --> 04:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
primary and general election if an
 
04:57:48.410 --> 04:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
election official used the full 14 days
 
04:57:50.868 --> 04:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
it would cause New Hampshire to be in
 
04:57:54.650 --> 04:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
violation of the federal law there this
 
04:57:56.990 --> 04:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
could result in military personnel using
 
04:57:59.448 --> 04:57:59.458 align:start position:0%
their opportunity to cast a ballot
 
04:58:01.550 --> 04:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
let me be clear I I do not believe
 
04:58:03.230 --> 04:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
anyone in this committee wants that to
 
04:58:05.690 --> 04:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
happen uh but it exactly what could
 
04:58:08.090 --> 04:58:08.100 align:start position:0%
happen uh when this law is an act that
 
04:58:09.708 --> 04:58:09.718 align:start position:0%
is written
 
04:58:12.110 --> 04:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
additionally uh we are now just three
 
04:58:14.390 --> 04:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
short weeks from Rochester special
 
04:58:16.610 --> 04:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
election in less than two months from
 
04:58:18.230 --> 04:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
town meeting day
 
04:58:20.270 --> 04:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
in a local election officials have yet
 
04:58:22.368 --> 04:58:22.378 align:start position:0%
to receive any specific guidance from
 
04:58:24.530 --> 04:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State office on how
 
04:58:27.110 --> 04:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
this new system would be implemented
 
04:58:29.270 --> 04:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's the one I wrote this maybe he
 
04:58:32.510 --> 04:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
gave it today election officials still
 
04:58:35.330 --> 04:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
have not seen a packet they will give to
 
04:58:36.830 --> 04:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
the voters including the overnight
 
04:58:39.830 --> 04:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
Prepaid U.S Postal Service priority mail
 
04:58:42.050 --> 04:58:42.060 align:start position:0%
package Francis overnight delivery
 
04:58:44.150 --> 04:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
envelopes addressed to the Secretary of
 
04:58:44.160 --> 04:58:45.050 align:start position:0%
envelopes addressed to the Secretary of
State

04:58:45.050 --> 04:58:45.060 align:start position:0%
State
 
04:58:47.690 --> 04:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
Capital forms it must have to be filled
 
04:58:49.250 --> 04:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
out in a checklist to make sure that all
 
04:58:50.930 --> 04:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
officials are performing all steps
 
04:58:53.570 --> 04:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
correct and in a uniform manner
 
04:58:55.070 --> 04:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
so that would be throughout the whole
 
04:58:55.080 --> 04:58:56.270 align:start position:0%
so that would be throughout the whole

state
 
04:58:58.310 --> 04:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
Rochester is also another good example
 
04:59:00.830 --> 04:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
of a fundamental flaw in this bill what
 
04:59:02.628 --> 04:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
happens if the special election once
 
04:59:05.150 --> 04:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
again ends in a tie but one or two
 
04:59:07.430 --> 04:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
voters use their new provisional ballot
 
04:59:07.440 --> 04:59:08.750 align:start position:0%
voters use their new provisional ballot
system

04:59:08.750 --> 04:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:59:11.448 --> 04:59:11.458 align:start position:0%
what if a candidate wins by one or only
 
04:59:13.190 --> 04:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
to see that the wind disappeared due to
 
04:59:15.948 --> 04:59:15.958 align:start position:0%
two ballots removed from the count
 
04:59:17.930 --> 04:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
it has been said many times over the
 
04:59:19.850 --> 04:59:19.860 align:start position:0%
past few months that New Hampshire does
 
04:59:21.110 --> 04:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
elections right
 
04:59:23.750 --> 04:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
in no small part because we get results
 
04:59:25.730 --> 04:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
right away
 
04:59:28.190 --> 04:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
this law has the potential to jeopardize
 
04:59:28.200 --> 04:59:30.110 align:start position:0%
this law has the potential to jeopardize
that

04:59:30.110 --> 04:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:59:31.970 --> 04:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
there will be several other individuals
 
04:59:33.708 --> 04:59:33.718 align:start position:0%
that will testify to their concerns
 
04:59:36.708 --> 04:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
about the changes taking effect January
 
04:59:40.550 --> 04:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
1st 2023 as a result of the
 
04:59:44.208 --> 04:59:44.218 align:start position:0%
implementation of SB 418
 
04:59:46.610 --> 04:59:46.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is and should be proud of
 
04:59:49.910 --> 04:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
its elections the UNH poll after this
 
04:59:51.830 --> 04:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
past election said that 92 percent of
 
04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
the voters have faith in our elections
 
04:59:56.930 --> 04:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
our elections are well run and our
 
04:59:59.270 --> 04:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
voters have confidence in them
 
05:00:01.970 --> 05:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
SB 418 could cause that confidence to
 
05:00:04.128 --> 05:00:04.138 align:start position:0%
shriek with implementation confusion
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
delayed results and people's voting
 
05:00:08.690 --> 05:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
votes not counting
 
05:00:11.390 --> 05:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
but thank you and please consider voting
 
05:00:14.810 --> 05:00:14.820 align:start position:0%
OTP on Bill HB 502

05:00:22.490 --> 05:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
and with that that concludes my written
 
05:00:24.650 --> 05:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
testimony and if anybody has any
 
05:00:26.270 --> 05:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be more than happy to give
 
05:00:30.530 --> 05:00:30.540 align:start position:0%

good afternoon as I said my name is Ed
 
05:01:08.030 --> 05:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
Frederick I live in Loudon and I'm a
 
05:01:09.288 --> 05:01:09.298 align:start position:0%
former officer with the United States
 
05:01:11.690 --> 05:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
Marine Corps uh and served during
 
05:01:11.700 --> 05:01:14.090 align:start position:0%
Marine Corps uh and served during
Vietnam

05:01:14.090 --> 05:01:14.100 align:start position:0%
Vietnam
 
05:01:16.430 --> 05:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
um absentee voting started in the War of
 
05:01:18.590 --> 05:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
1812 and the Civil War to give service
 
05:01:20.628 --> 05:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
members the ability to exercise the
 
05:01:22.490 --> 05:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
right for which they were willing to
 
05:01:24.170 --> 05:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
sacrifice all
 
05:01:26.150 --> 05:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
for the past two decades our service
 
05:01:28.490 --> 05:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
members deployed to the Middle East and
 
05:01:29.930 --> 05:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
other theaters have been able to vote
 
05:01:31.910 --> 05:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
via absentee ballot
 
05:01:33.530 --> 05:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
but a bill passed by this year's
 
05:01:36.230 --> 05:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
legislation SB 418
 
05:01:38.208 --> 05:01:38.218 align:start position:0%
makes it more difficult for our service
 
05:01:39.830 --> 05:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
men and women deployed around the world
 
05:01:42.530 --> 05:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
to make their voices heard and vote even
 
05:01:44.570 --> 05:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
as they protect that right with our
 
05:01:44.580 --> 05:01:46.128 align:start position:0%
as they protect that right with our
country

05:01:46.128 --> 05:01:46.138 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:01:49.010 --> 05:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
as a military veteran and I'm a
 
05:01:50.990 --> 05:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
grandfather of an active U.S Navy
 
05:01:53.810 --> 05:01:53.820 align:start position:0%
service member from New Boston
 
05:01:56.090 --> 05:01:56.100 align:start position:0%
I want to request your support for HP
 
05:01:56.100 --> 05:01:57.410 align:start position:0%
I want to request your support for HP
502

05:01:57.410 --> 05:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
502
 
05:02:00.708 --> 05:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
which will overturn SB 418
 
05:02:02.750 --> 05:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
the bill that has created new
 
05:02:04.490 --> 05:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
complicated voting rules that will
 
05:02:06.230 --> 05:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
directly limit the opportunity for
 
05:02:08.090 --> 05:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
members of the military station overseas
 
05:02:10.490 --> 05:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
to guess their ballots
 
05:02:13.250 --> 05:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
SB 418 makes it nearly impossible for
 
05:02:14.990 --> 05:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's local election officials
 
05:02:17.090 --> 05:02:17.100 align:start position:0%
to mail ballots to active duty military
 
05:02:20.208 --> 05:02:20.218 align:start position:0%
voters for future general elections in
 
05:02:22.430 --> 05:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
line with Federal requirements
 
05:02:24.708 --> 05:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
it will needlessly complicate New
 
05:02:26.628 --> 05:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's election process
 
05:02:28.730 --> 05:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
and may delay certification of winners
 
05:02:30.288 --> 05:02:30.298 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire primary elections
 
05:02:33.770 --> 05:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
starting in 2024 for weeks
 
05:02:36.948 --> 05:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
it has also felt that SB 418 likely
 
05:02:39.350 --> 05:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
violates federal law that protects
 
05:02:40.970 --> 05:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
military voters
 
05:02:43.490 --> 05:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
the uniform and overseas citizens
 
05:02:46.368 --> 05:02:46.378 align:start position:0%
absentee Voting Act uacava
 
05:02:48.830 --> 05:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
a federal law that determines processes
 
05:02:50.570 --> 05:02:50.580 align:start position:0%
for members of the military to cast
 
05:02:53.570 --> 05:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
their ballot requires ballots to be
 
05:02:56.208 --> 05:02:56.218 align:start position:0%
mailed to military voters 45 days before
 
05:02:58.128 --> 05:02:58.138 align:start position:0%
a federal election
 
05:03:00.350 --> 05:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
that means that local election officials
 
05:03:02.150 --> 05:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
are required to mail general election
 
05:03:05.090 --> 05:03:05.100 align:start position:0%
ballots to military members only a few
 
05:03:08.050 --> 05:03:08.060 align:start position:0%
days after and possibly even before
 
05:03:10.430 --> 05:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
primary election results are certified
 
05:03:13.250 --> 05:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
under SB 418.
 
05:03:15.350 --> 05:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
this creates an impossible task for
 
05:03:17.930 --> 05:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
local election officials and may
 
05:03:19.730 --> 05:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
ultimately restrict our armed service
 
05:03:23.030 --> 05:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
members from casting their ballots
 
05:03:25.670 --> 05:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
supporters have claimed that SB 418 will
 
05:03:27.830 --> 05:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
improve the sanctity of Elections and
 
05:03:29.690 --> 05:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
improve voter confidence
 
05:03:32.750 --> 05:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
but many veterans Town clerks Secretary
 
05:03:35.208 --> 05:03:35.218 align:start position:0%
of State and the ACLU and others
 
05:03:37.730 --> 05:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
testified in opposition maintaining that
 
05:03:39.650 --> 05:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
this bill attempts to solve a problem
 
05:03:41.570 --> 05:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
that does not exist
 
05:03:43.610 --> 05:03:43.620 align:start position:0%
their testimony in that of the Secretary
 
05:03:46.368 --> 05:03:46.378 align:start position:0%
of State Mr Scanlon who suggested
 
05:03:49.010 --> 05:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
tabling SB 418 and asking the state
 
05:03:51.410 --> 05:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
supreme court for an opinion
 
05:03:54.050 --> 05:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
of its constitutionality was not enough
 
05:03:57.230 --> 05:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
to put the brakes in this legislation
 
05:03:59.330 --> 05:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
was less than two years before the next
 
05:04:01.610 --> 05:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
election now is not the time to make our
 
05:04:03.890 --> 05:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
local election officials job more
 
05:04:03.900 --> 05:04:05.150 align:start position:0%
local election officials job more
difficult

05:04:05.150 --> 05:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
05:04:07.490 --> 05:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
as they already faced many unneeded
 
05:04:09.410 --> 05:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
threats and complications to run our
 
05:04:12.050 --> 05:04:12.060 align:start position:0%
elections it is also not the time to
 
05:04:14.090 --> 05:04:14.100 align:start position:0%
limit opportunities for members of the
 
05:04:16.670 --> 05:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
military to participate in the Democracy
 
05:04:18.830 --> 05:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
they are safeguarding
 
05:04:20.750 --> 05:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
with more New Hampshire service members
 
05:04:22.550 --> 05:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
being deployed
 
05:04:24.948 --> 05:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
and with to NATO countries in Eastern
 
05:04:27.650 --> 05:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
Europe due to the war in Ukraine
 
05:04:29.750 --> 05:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
we cannot and should not make it make
 
05:04:32.628 --> 05:04:32.638 align:start position:0%
voting even more difficult for them
 
05:04:36.350 --> 05:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
I ask you to move HP 502 as ought to
 
05:04:38.208 --> 05:04:38.218 align:start position:0%
pass out of this committee
 
05:04:40.970 --> 05:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
I can't even imagine how absurdly
 
05:04:43.250 --> 05:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
terrible it would be if there was even
 
05:04:45.708 --> 05:04:45.718 align:start position:0%
one service member's vote nullified
 
05:04:47.570 --> 05:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
because the restrictions imposed by
 
05:04:47.580 --> 05:04:49.310 align:start position:0%
because the restrictions imposed by
sp418

05:04:49.310 --> 05:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
sp418
 
05:04:50.810 --> 05:04:50.820 align:start position:0%
. thank you for your time and attention
 
05:04:52.970 --> 05:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
to this very important issue
 
05:04:55.970 --> 05:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:04:57.650 --> 05:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
um I have a question um first of all
 
05:04:59.510 --> 05:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your service I'm the son
 
05:05:01.430 --> 05:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
of a Vietnam veteran who has a bronze
 
05:05:03.948 --> 05:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
star and as my dad told me I would never
 
05:05:06.708 --> 05:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
meet a Vietnam veteran welcome home
 
05:05:09.590 --> 05:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
um your concerns as your testimony are
 
05:05:11.810 --> 05:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
about the you will clava deadline which
 
05:05:14.570 --> 05:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
is the 45-day mail out before a general
 
05:05:16.788 --> 05:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
election uh the absentee about has to be
 
05:05:19.330 --> 05:05:19.340 align:start position:0%
mailed out your concerns for SB 418
 
05:05:22.250 --> 05:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
peeling the affidavit ballot are about
 
05:05:23.930 --> 05:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
that deadline is constrained and we'd be
 
05:05:26.030 --> 05:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
violating federal law if the primary
 
05:05:27.890 --> 05:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
date was moved
 
05:05:30.410 --> 05:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
those concerns about yokava would be
 
05:05:32.270 --> 05:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
mute because we would be able to finish
 
05:05:34.368 --> 05:05:34.378 align:start position:0%
it so would you still have concerns
 
05:05:35.990 --> 05:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
about the bill if the primary date was
 
05:05:37.910 --> 05:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
moved in the uokava concern was dealt
 
05:05:37.920 --> 05:05:38.628 align:start position:0%
moved in the uokava concern was dealt
with

05:05:38.628 --> 05:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:05:40.070 --> 05:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
um I'd really rather not answer that
 
05:05:43.368 --> 05:05:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:46.010 --> 05:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:59.570 --> 05:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:11.510 --> 05:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair and members of
 
05:06:13.810 --> 05:06:13.820 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:06:18.530 --> 05:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
I speak in support of hb502
 
05:06:21.230 --> 05:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
as you know this bill repeals Provisions
 
05:06:24.350 --> 05:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
relative to voter affidavit ballots
 
05:06:28.490 --> 05:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
found in current law derived from SB 418
 
05:06:32.150 --> 05:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
which is currently in litigation
 
05:06:34.128 --> 05:06:34.138 align:start position:0%
if it takes as long for the courts to
 
05:06:36.590 --> 05:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
resolve the current case as it did sb3
 
05:06:39.470 --> 05:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
in 2017 four years
 
05:06:41.150 --> 05:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
the current law will remain in effect
 
05:06:44.150 --> 05:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
for multiples of election Cycles
 
05:06:47.090 --> 05:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
if it is overturned an unknown multiple
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
of Voters will have been unduly burdened
 
05:06:52.810 --> 05:06:52.820 align:start position:0%
and perhaps intimidated simply
 
05:06:54.830 --> 05:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
exercising their right under the New
 
05:06:57.230 --> 05:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution to vote
 
05:06:59.930 --> 05:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
another unknown number of eligibles will
 
05:07:02.650 --> 05:07:02.660 align:start position:0%
have been provided incorrect information
 
05:07:05.890 --> 05:07:05.900 align:start position:0%
about the process by friends
 
05:07:09.948 --> 05:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
relatives neighbors or social media and
 
05:07:11.690 --> 05:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
decided that the process was too
 
05:07:14.390 --> 05:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
complicated contradicted or too
 
05:07:17.270 --> 05:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
misunderstood by them to safely
 
05:07:17.280 --> 05:07:19.250 align:start position:0%
misunderstood by them to safely
participate

05:07:19.250 --> 05:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
participate
 
05:07:22.970 --> 05:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
passage of hb502 will
 
05:07:25.610 --> 05:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
one simplify the voting process and
 
05:07:27.410 --> 05:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
protect voter privacy because it does
 
05:07:31.010 --> 05:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
not require use of traceable ballots
 
05:07:34.490 --> 05:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
the secret ballot is also our sacred
 
05:07:37.910 --> 05:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
ballot two eliminate what the state of
 
05:07:39.708 --> 05:07:39.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has vigorously and
 
05:07:43.310 --> 05:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
admirably opposed over many years the
 
05:07:45.530 --> 05:07:45.540 align:start position:0%
use of provisional ballots
 
05:07:48.890 --> 05:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
3 eliminate concerns over our Motor
 
05:07:51.590 --> 05:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
Voter exception maintaining use of
 
05:07:54.230 --> 05:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
same-day registration which we have used
 
05:07:57.470 --> 05:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
continuously since 1993.
 
05:08:00.470 --> 05:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
or jeopardize our first in the nation
 
05:08:03.070 --> 05:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
status because our status is always
 
05:08:07.368 --> 05:08:07.378 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to hijacking by other states
 
05:08:09.948 --> 05:08:09.958 align:start position:0%
we know now it is under review at the
 
05:08:11.530 --> 05:08:11.540 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
05:08:14.448 --> 05:08:14.458 align:start position:0%
hb502 puts us in a better position to
 
05:08:16.310 --> 05:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
wad off the challenges
 
05:08:19.128 --> 05:08:19.138 align:start position:0%
five eliminate the possibility that a
 
05:08:21.050 --> 05:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
voter could not Rectify his or her
 
05:08:24.170 --> 05:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
identity within the mandatory seven-day
 
05:08:27.110 --> 05:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
period due to consequences beyond the
 
05:08:28.850 --> 05:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
voter's control
 
05:08:31.250 --> 05:08:31.260 align:start position:0%
administrative bureaucracy delayed
 
05:08:35.090 --> 05:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
mailings the unforeseen
 
05:08:37.368 --> 05:08:37.378 align:start position:0%
six eliminate concerns over the known
 
05:08:40.550 --> 05:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
short yokava deadlines
 
05:08:42.948 --> 05:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
we often think of you okava voters as
 
05:08:44.930 --> 05:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
being military personnel stationed
 
05:08:47.510 --> 05:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
overseas but we know it also includes
 
05:08:49.368 --> 05:08:49.378 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire civilians who work
 
05:08:49.378 --> 05:08:51.050 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire civilians who work
overseas

05:08:51.050 --> 05:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
overseas
 
05:08:54.410 --> 05:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
seven absolve the moderator or clerk
 
05:08:57.050 --> 05:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
from the penalty of perjury when either
 
05:09:01.788 --> 05:09:01.798 align:start position:0%
vouches for the legitimacy of a Voda
 
05:09:04.390 --> 05:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
we know Granite State taxpayers gave up
 
05:09:07.430 --> 05:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
3.35 million dollars for the state to
 
05:09:11.650 --> 05:09:11.660 align:start position:0%
defend sb3 which figure does not include
 
05:09:15.350 --> 05:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
4176 billable hours by the AG's office
 
05:09:18.050 --> 05:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
and we know the total outside legal cost
 
05:09:20.690 --> 05:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
was 4.2 million
 
05:09:22.490 --> 05:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
on the other hand we know from the
 
05:09:25.550 --> 05:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on 502 that repeal of
 
05:09:27.410 --> 05:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
current law will save Granite State
 
05:09:31.128 --> 05:09:31.138 align:start position:0%
taxpayers 178 thousand dollars in fiscal
 
05:09:32.810 --> 05:09:32.820 align:start position:0%
year 2024
 
05:09:38.448 --> 05:09:38.458 align:start position:0%
and 354 000 in fiscal year 2025.
 
05:09:41.628 --> 05:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
lastly it is safe to predict that the
 
05:09:43.250 --> 05:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
longer the lawsuit on the current law
 
05:09:46.010 --> 05:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
exists though more public dollars will
 
05:09:49.010 --> 05:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
be spent by the AG's office and to other
 
05:09:52.550 --> 05:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
entities to defend it
 
05:09:57.288 --> 05:09:57.298 align:start position:0%
I urge OTP on hb502 and I thank you
 
05:10:00.490 --> 05:10:00.500 align:start position:0%
the questions from the committee
 
05:10:02.868 --> 05:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Perry
 
05:10:18.350 --> 05:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:20.750 --> 05:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
welcome to election law
 
05:10:22.128 --> 05:10:22.138 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:10:23.930 --> 05:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
05:10:26.868 --> 05:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Matt musian I live in
 
05:10:28.490 --> 05:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
Claremont where I serve as a city
 
05:10:30.830 --> 05:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
councilor and today I'm here
 
05:10:34.010 --> 05:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
representing 603 forward a nonpartisan
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
non-profit organization dedicated to
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
empowering and building young folks in
 
05:10:42.590 --> 05:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:10:45.350 --> 05:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh I'm here today to testify in support
 
05:10:48.530 --> 05:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 502 which would repeal the
 
05:10:51.050 --> 05:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
provisional ballot system put into law
 
05:10:52.910 --> 05:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
this year
 
05:10:55.610 --> 05:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
um the new provisional ballot system
 
05:10:59.030 --> 05:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
creates unnecessary confusion and
 
05:11:01.510 --> 05:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
complicates the voting process
 
05:11:01.520 --> 05:11:03.550 align:start position:0%
complicates the voting process
disproportionately

05:11:03.550 --> 05:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
disproportionately
 
05:11:05.570 --> 05:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
burdening the right to vote for working
 
05:11:08.690 --> 05:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
age Granite Staters and Military voters
 
05:11:11.570 --> 05:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
who are predominantly younger which is
 
05:11:13.610 --> 05:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
why I would urge the committee to vote
 
05:11:16.690 --> 05:11:16.700 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on House Bill 502
 
05:11:19.910 --> 05:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
the original ballot system has done
 
05:11:22.670 --> 05:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
really nothing to improve our elections
 
05:11:25.788 --> 05:11:25.798 align:start position:0%
and it was founded from a place rooted
 
05:11:28.550 --> 05:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
in conspiracies which sought only to
 
05:11:31.550 --> 05:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
weaken faith in our elections
 
05:11:33.650 --> 05:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
um and I would also say that in the last
 
05:11:37.850 --> 05:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
presidential election 50 of working age
 
05:11:41.390 --> 05:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
voters aged 18 to 29 participated and
 
05:11:43.490 --> 05:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
took went to the went to the polls to
 
05:11:43.500 --> 05:11:44.390 align:start position:0%
took went to the went to the polls to
vote

05:11:44.390 --> 05:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
vote
 
05:11:46.490 --> 05:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
and this new provisional ballot system
 
05:11:48.590 --> 05:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
would only make it harder for working
 
05:11:50.810 --> 05:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
age voters to participate in the
 
05:11:53.510 --> 05:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
Democratic process by making same-day
 
05:11:55.970 --> 05:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
voter registration a more difficult and
 
05:11:59.090 --> 05:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:01.368 --> 05:12:01.378 align:start position:0%
additionally by implementing a
 
05:12:03.770 --> 05:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
provisional ballot system as a means to
 
05:12:06.288 --> 05:12:06.298 align:start position:0%
track someone's vote there are new
 
05:12:08.390 --> 05:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
threats to our ballot security and
 
05:12:10.250 --> 05:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
privacy because these provisional
 
05:12:12.530 --> 05:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
ballots will now have a unique number
 
05:12:15.110 --> 05:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
connecting them to the name of a voter
 
05:12:17.868 --> 05:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
meaning that in a small town or a small
 
05:12:19.850 --> 05:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
City like Claremont your community
 
05:12:22.128 --> 05:12:22.138 align:start position:0%
members who work at the polls may know
 
05:12:24.850 --> 05:12:24.860 align:start position:0%
who you voted for
 
05:12:27.230 --> 05:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
as you've heard the provisional ballot
 
05:12:29.570 --> 05:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
system also will make it harder for
 
05:12:32.448 --> 05:12:32.458 align:start position:0%
military members their families and
 
05:12:34.970 --> 05:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
other U.S citizens living outside of the
 
05:12:38.708 --> 05:12:38.718 align:start position:0%
country to vote and last year several
 
05:12:41.330 --> 05:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
high-profile former senior military
 
05:12:44.448 --> 05:12:44.458 align:start position:0%
leaders in over two dozen local election
 
05:12:47.090 --> 05:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
officials had vocally opposed the
 
05:12:48.830 --> 05:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
legislation that created the provisional
 
05:12:51.350 --> 05:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
ballot system
 
05:12:54.470 --> 05:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
and I would add that military leaders in
 
05:12:56.930 --> 05:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
our local election officials know the
 
05:12:59.090 --> 05:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
importance of a free and fair election
 
05:13:01.850 --> 05:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
perhaps better than anyone and House
 
05:13:04.788 --> 05:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
Bill 502 would honor their service by
 
05:13:06.530 --> 05:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
protecting the right to vote and making
 
05:13:09.230 --> 05:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
sure that overseas military members are
 
05:13:11.208 --> 05:13:11.218 align:start position:0%
included in our democracy no matter
 
05:13:13.128 --> 05:13:13.138 align:start position:0%
where they serve
 
05:13:15.470 --> 05:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
these are just some of the concerns we
 
05:13:16.850 --> 05:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
have around the provisional ballot
 
05:13:19.368 --> 05:13:19.378 align:start position:0%
system and the struggles it will put in
 
05:13:22.128 --> 05:13:22.138 align:start position:0%
place for young people exercising their
 
05:13:25.010 --> 05:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to vote
 
05:13:28.310 --> 05:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
and by creating unnecessary confusion
 
05:13:30.610 --> 05:13:30.620 align:start position:0%
and further complicating the process
 
05:13:32.810 --> 05:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
we're concerned that the provisional
 
05:13:35.390 --> 05:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
ballot system may result in voters
 
05:13:37.910 --> 05:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
feeling too intimidated or burdened to
 
05:13:40.070 --> 05:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
participate in the process
 
05:13:42.948 --> 05:13:42.958 align:start position:0%
after all while this new law is in place
 
05:13:45.470 --> 05:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
and we are just weeks out from an
 
05:13:47.810 --> 05:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
election local election officials still
 
05:13:49.970 --> 05:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
do not have any guidance on how to
 
05:13:53.570 --> 05:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
implement this new law and that should
 
05:13:55.610 --> 05:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
be that should be concerns for members
 
05:13:56.990 --> 05:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
of this committee
 
05:13:59.270 --> 05:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
I've worked at my local polling location
 
05:14:01.610 --> 05:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
before and I know that our election
 
05:14:04.010 --> 05:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
officials work very hard to ensure
 
05:14:05.868 --> 05:14:05.878 align:start position:0%
Granite State elections are safe and
 
05:14:05.878 --> 05:14:07.070 align:start position:0%
Granite State elections are safe and
secure

05:14:07.070 --> 05:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
secure
 
05:14:09.590 --> 05:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
these these additional needless and
 
05:14:11.628 --> 05:14:11.638 align:start position:0%
confusing systems will only serve to
 
05:14:13.490 --> 05:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
bird in our local local election
 
05:14:16.670 --> 05:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
officials and confuse everyone involved
 
05:14:18.590 --> 05:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
confusion leads to longer lines which
 
05:14:20.690 --> 05:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
are proven to disenfranchise eligible
 
05:14:20.700 --> 05:14:21.948 align:start position:0%
are proven to disenfranchise eligible
voters

05:14:21.948 --> 05:14:21.958 align:start position:0%
voters
 
05:14:24.288 --> 05:14:24.298 align:start position:0%
so I hope that this body will continue
 
05:14:26.330 --> 05:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
to prioritize making it easier for
 
05:14:28.310 --> 05:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
people to participate in the Bedrock of
 
05:14:30.350 --> 05:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
our democracy a free and fair election
 
05:14:33.230 --> 05:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
and please vote ought to pass on House
 
05:14:35.628 --> 05:14:35.638 align:start position:0%
Bill 502. thank you very much for your
 
05:14:37.430 --> 05:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
time and consideration
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:14:41.930 --> 05:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
um I have one
 
05:14:43.610 --> 05:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
um you said in your testimony we'll put
 
05:14:45.948 --> 05:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
military voters aside yokova is an issue
 
05:14:47.930 --> 05:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
of the primary date
 
05:14:50.150 --> 05:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
um you said it would this bill would if
 
05:14:52.250 --> 05:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
we did not repeal if we don't pass HP
 
05:14:55.730 --> 05:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
502 it would make it more burdensome uh
 
05:15:00.230 --> 05:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:02.030 --> 05:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
well because what's the I guess my
 
05:15:04.310 --> 05:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
question is what is the burden
 
05:15:07.250 --> 05:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
of that this is trying to remove
 
05:15:10.430 --> 05:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
so what you'll now be have forced faced
 
05:15:13.190 --> 05:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
with is taking a packet with you after
 
05:15:14.868 --> 05:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
if you do not meet the requirements of a
 
05:15:16.368 --> 05:15:16.378 align:start position:0%
same-day voter registration and having
 
05:15:18.770 --> 05:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
to follow up with that after which I
 
05:15:20.390 --> 05:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
think presents an additional burden
 
05:15:23.330 --> 05:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
because you know folks have schedules if
 
05:15:24.650 --> 05:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
you're perhaps going to be out of town
 
05:15:26.868 --> 05:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
if there's if there's any issue with you
 
05:15:30.050 --> 05:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
returning that packet of information
 
05:15:31.910 --> 05:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
um your ballot would then be discounted
 
05:15:34.070 --> 05:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
so I think that that presents an
 
05:15:35.930 --> 05:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
additional burden and I think also there
 
05:15:37.610 --> 05:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
are burdens on our local election
 
05:15:40.010 --> 05:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
officials who need to continue to
 
05:15:41.570 --> 05:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
maintain the system and make sure that
 
05:15:42.708 --> 05:15:42.718 align:start position:0%
people are moving through it in an
 
05:15:44.810 --> 05:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
efficient manner okay so so what makes
 
05:15:46.670 --> 05:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
the the voters on Election Day that are
 
05:15:48.890 --> 05:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
getting this packet what are they doing
 
05:15:50.448 --> 05:15:50.458 align:start position:0%
that's getting them this packet in this
 
05:15:52.070 --> 05:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballot what have they
 
05:15:52.080 --> 05:15:53.208 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballot what have they
forgotten

05:15:53.208 --> 05:15:53.218 align:start position:0%
forgotten
 
05:15:55.430 --> 05:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
so they are registering to vote for the
 
05:15:57.590 --> 05:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
first time and they've forgotten some
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
form of uh limited one of the one of the
 
05:16:01.490 --> 05:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
requirements necessary to be able to
 
05:16:03.530 --> 05:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
vote that day okay all right thank you
 
05:16:06.770 --> 05:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
05:16:08.930 --> 05:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
thank you oh I apologize representative
 
05:16:10.610 --> 05:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
Howard I missed you
 
05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr veischer and uh thank
 
05:16:14.990 --> 05:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
you for coming uh and testifying today I
 
05:16:17.930 --> 05:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask how uh this bill would
 
05:16:21.788 --> 05:16:21.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:24.288 --> 05:16:24.298 align:start position:0%
that's a great that's a good question so
 
05:16:26.570 --> 05:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
you know uh oftentimes one of the
 
05:16:29.390 --> 05:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
reasons that young folks may need to uh
 
05:16:31.190 --> 05:16:31.200 align:start position:0%
register to vote on election days
 
05:16:32.570 --> 05:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
because they've come here for school or
 
05:16:34.850 --> 05:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
their new student so for anyone who's
 
05:16:37.490 --> 05:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
coming here uh to vote or who is newly
 
05:16:40.070 --> 05:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
18 is in as a student would need to be
 
05:16:41.750 --> 05:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
able to register at the poll on Election
 
05:16:45.110 --> 05:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
Day so by repealing uh the provisional
 
05:16:47.030 --> 05:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
ballot law uh it removes some of the
 
05:16:51.948 --> 05:16:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:53.810 --> 05:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
thank you piggybacking on representative
 
05:16:56.930 --> 05:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
Howard so if this student that's
 
05:16:58.190 --> 05:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
registering on Election Day brought
 
05:16:59.810 --> 05:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
their ID they'd still be able to
 
05:17:00.890 --> 05:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
register to vote and they wouldn't get
 
05:17:02.810 --> 05:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
an affidavit balance is that correct if
 
05:17:04.430 --> 05:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
they had all the necessary requirements
 
05:17:08.330 --> 05:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:11.448 --> 05:17:11.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:15.470 --> 05:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
um next up is McKinsey St German St
 
05:17:17.930 --> 05:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
Germain I missed the eye I apologize I'm
 
05:17:20.208 --> 05:17:20.218 align:start position:0%

05:17:21.470 --> 05:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
know you know your handwriting's fine
 
05:17:22.970 --> 05:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
you're just not the first name I've run
 
05:17:24.890 --> 05:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
over Unfortunately today
 
05:17:26.690 --> 05:17:26.700 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:17:28.310 --> 05:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm Mackenzie St Germain I'm the
 
05:17:29.510 --> 05:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
campaign director for the New Hampshire
 
05:17:31.250 --> 05:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
campaign for voting rights which is a
 
05:17:33.350 --> 05:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
project of America votes New Hampshire
 
05:17:34.730 --> 05:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire campaign for voting
 
05:17:37.310 --> 05:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
rights is a nonpartisan Coalition we are
 
05:17:38.930 --> 05:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
committed to protecting voter access and
 
05:17:40.730 --> 05:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
voting rights as well as modernizing our
 
05:17:42.708 --> 05:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
elections in New Hampshire and I'm here
 
05:17:45.170 --> 05:17:45.180 align:start position:0%
today in support of hb502 which would
 
05:17:48.288 --> 05:17:48.298 align:start position:0%
repeal the provisions of SB 418 which
 
05:17:50.868 --> 05:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
were passed last year from the time that
 
05:17:53.330 --> 05:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
SB 418 began working its way through the
 
05:17:55.550 --> 05:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
legislature in 2022 the New Hampshire
 
05:17:57.590 --> 05:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
campaign for voting rights was outspoken
 
05:18:00.890 --> 05:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
about our concerns SB 418 makes same-day
 
05:18:03.230 --> 05:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
registration more difficult for voters
 
05:18:05.810 --> 05:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
not everyone has an ID not everyone
 
05:18:07.550 --> 05:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
remembers to bring their ID with them
 
05:18:09.708 --> 05:18:09.718 align:start position:0%
for various reasons makes that more
 
05:18:11.390 --> 05:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
complicated for voters
 
05:18:13.368 --> 05:18:13.378 align:start position:0%
um and also is a burden on our election
 
05:18:15.530 --> 05:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
officials who now must administer this
 
05:18:17.208 --> 05:18:17.218 align:start position:0%
legislation I know the New Hampshire
 
05:18:20.510 --> 05:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
town and Clerk's Association in 2022 was
 
05:18:22.850 --> 05:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
opposed to this legislation and can
 
05:18:24.170 --> 05:18:24.180 align:start position:0%
probably tell you more about the
 
05:18:25.788 --> 05:18:25.798 align:start position:0%
specific burden on those election
 
05:18:25.798 --> 05:18:27.170 align:start position:0%
specific burden on those election
officials

05:18:27.170 --> 05:18:27.180 align:start position:0%
officials
 
05:18:30.410 --> 05:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
one of the issues with SB 418 and the
 
05:18:32.990 --> 05:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
new Provisions we have now is the threat
 
05:18:34.850 --> 05:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
to secret ballots as was talked about
 
05:18:37.310 --> 05:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
before if in a small town one person
 
05:18:40.430 --> 05:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
cast their uh affidavit ballot because
 
05:18:42.590 --> 05:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
they don't have their ID with them they
 
05:18:44.510 --> 05:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
leave with a packet of information it's
 
05:18:46.430 --> 05:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
very easy to see a world in which you
 
05:18:48.170 --> 05:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
see your neighbor leaving with this
 
05:18:49.850 --> 05:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
extra packet of information you know
 
05:18:53.510 --> 05:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
that they cost a affidavit ballot you
 
05:18:55.550 --> 05:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
know 10 days two weeks later you see
 
05:18:58.010 --> 05:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
those numbers of the results change and
 
05:18:59.690 --> 05:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
you all of a sudden know who your
 
05:19:02.030 --> 05:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
neighbor voted for and that is a direct
 
05:19:04.610 --> 05:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
threat to the secrecy of each individual
 
05:19:06.230 --> 05:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
voter's ballot
 
05:19:07.550 --> 05:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
um another issue which obviously has
 
05:19:09.470 --> 05:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
been brought up multiple times today is
 
05:19:11.448 --> 05:19:11.458 align:start position:0%
the threat to our military their
 
05:19:13.430 --> 05:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
families serving overseas and the
 
05:19:14.930 --> 05:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
timeline of this bill
 
05:19:16.250 --> 05:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
um which would make right now with the
 
05:19:18.770 --> 05:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
primary a challenge of you know getting
 
05:19:21.410 --> 05:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
those yokava ballots over to our
 
05:19:21.420 --> 05:19:22.670 align:start position:0%
those yokava ballots over to our
overseas

05:19:22.670 --> 05:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
overseas
 
05:19:24.770 --> 05:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
um folks in time and making sure that
 
05:19:27.470 --> 05:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
their votes are cast and are counted in
 
05:19:29.628 --> 05:19:29.638 align:start position:0%
time because of that the yukava deadline
 
05:19:31.368 --> 05:19:31.378 align:start position:0%
and making sure that there's plenty of
 
05:19:33.770 --> 05:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
time to get those ballots back I don't
 
05:19:36.128 --> 05:19:36.138 align:start position:0%
think anyone has any interest in
 
05:19:38.330 --> 05:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising our overseas military
 
05:19:40.310 --> 05:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
but that in the way that the bill is
 
05:19:42.050 --> 05:19:42.060 align:start position:0%
passed currently is that exactly what it
 
05:19:42.060 --> 05:19:43.128 align:start position:0%
passed currently is that exactly what it
does

05:19:43.128 --> 05:19:43.138 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:19:44.810 --> 05:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
um and as it's been said today as well
 
05:19:47.208 --> 05:19:47.218 align:start position:0%
and I want to repeat everything but uh
 
05:19:48.890 --> 05:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
this legislation does not yet have we
 
05:19:51.110 --> 05:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
don't have guidance for voters I looked
 
05:19:52.310 --> 05:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
on the Secretary of State's website
 
05:19:55.010 --> 05:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
today it says that you can cast a ballot
 
05:19:56.750 --> 05:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
even if you go to register at the polls
 
05:19:59.810 --> 05:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
without an ID you can sign an affidavit
 
05:20:01.910 --> 05:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
that is no longer the case and we really
 
05:20:03.650 --> 05:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
need that guidance for our local
 
05:20:06.230 --> 05:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
election officials and for voters as we
 
05:20:08.570 --> 05:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
are three weeks ahead of an election in
 
05:20:08.580 --> 05:20:09.708 align:start position:0%
are three weeks ahead of an election in
Rochester

05:20:09.708 --> 05:20:09.718 align:start position:0%
Rochester
 
05:20:11.090 --> 05:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
um and just months you know less than a
 
05:20:13.128 --> 05:20:13.138 align:start position:0%
couple months away from uh the town
 
05:20:16.010 --> 05:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
meeting day so for those reasons um many
 
05:20:19.250 --> 05:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
more I ask that you support hb502 and
 
05:20:21.530 --> 05:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions

on the committee
 
05:20:27.830 --> 05:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:30.650 --> 05:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
um we'll go up with uh Henry Clement oh

Henry clemento wits whiz
 
05:20:39.948 --> 05:20:39.958 align:start position:0%
ah man I should know by now too because
 
05:20:43.610 --> 05:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:45.530 --> 05:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh members of the
 
05:20:47.448 --> 05:20:47.458 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Henry clementowicz
 
05:20:49.610 --> 05:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
I'm a senior staff attorney at the
 
05:20:51.288 --> 05:20:51.298 align:start position:0%
American civil liberties Union of New
 
05:20:51.298 --> 05:20:52.788 align:start position:0%
American civil liberties Union of New
Hampshire

05:20:52.788 --> 05:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:20:55.750 --> 05:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
um I've been in one capacity or another
 
05:21:00.110 --> 05:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh Council in five of the last uh voting
 
05:21:02.990 --> 05:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
rights lawsuits in the state
 
05:21:06.830 --> 05:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
um and this is a large part of my job
 
05:21:10.430 --> 05:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh ACLU of New Hampshire opposed 418
 
05:21:13.368 --> 05:21:13.378 align:start position:0%
last session uh because we thought it
 
05:21:16.190 --> 05:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
was bad policy and because uh we thought
 
05:21:18.288 --> 05:21:18.298 align:start position:0%
it was unconstitutional enough for a few
 
05:21:21.288 --> 05:21:21.298 align:start position:0%
reasons and so we support this effort to
 
05:21:24.708 --> 05:21:24.718 align:start position:0%
repeal it we are also Council in one of
 
05:21:27.470 --> 05:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
the two Consolidated challenges to SP
 
05:21:30.708 --> 05:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
418 that was being heard by judge Temple
 
05:21:34.190 --> 05:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
yesterday in Hillsboro Superior Court
 
05:21:35.930 --> 05:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
um in addition to being I think bad
 
05:21:39.650 --> 05:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
policy in that it's really a solution in
 
05:21:42.650 --> 05:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
search of a problem by imposing new
 
05:21:44.810 --> 05:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
requirements on voters that are not
 
05:21:48.110 --> 05:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
supported by I think any rational
 
05:21:48.120 --> 05:21:49.610 align:start position:0%
supported by I think any rational
um

05:21:49.610 --> 05:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:52.970 --> 05:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
uh State interest uh there I just wanted
 
05:21:56.230 --> 05:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
to alert the committee to three of the
 
05:21:59.750 --> 05:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh potential constitutional informa
 
05:22:01.910 --> 05:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
infirmities that are being in the
 
05:22:04.270 --> 05:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
process of being presented to the court
 
05:22:07.930 --> 05:22:07.940 align:start position:0%
one involves the deadline for certifying
 
05:22:11.150 --> 05:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
elections within five days in part two
 
05:22:12.650 --> 05:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
article 32 of the New Hampshire
 
05:22:12.660 --> 05:22:14.030 align:start position:0%
article 32 of the New Hampshire
Constitution

05:22:14.030 --> 05:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
05:22:17.930 --> 05:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
uh this bill by requiring the
 
05:22:19.850 --> 05:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
retabulation of certain votes after
 
05:22:22.430 --> 05:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
between 7 and 14 days after the election
 
05:22:24.650 --> 05:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
and then potentially delaying the
 
05:22:27.230 --> 05:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
recounts for those elections one of the
 
05:22:29.990 --> 05:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
claims is that that violates part two
 
05:22:32.150 --> 05:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
article 32
 
05:22:36.050 --> 05:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
there is a uh a framework a legal
 
05:22:38.330 --> 05:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
framework called Anderson Burdick which
 
05:22:40.010 --> 05:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
is named after two U.S Supreme Court
 
05:22:42.470 --> 05:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
cases that as a framework used by
 
05:22:43.970 --> 05:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
federal courts and by our state court
 
05:22:46.368 --> 05:22:46.378 align:start position:0%
and how to evaluate burdens placed on
 
05:22:49.430 --> 05:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
voters it's a sliding scale where the
 
05:22:51.650 --> 05:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
interests in the state that the state
 
05:22:53.510 --> 05:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
has in advancing a law are weighed
 
05:22:55.190 --> 05:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
against the burdens placed on voters
 
05:22:57.708 --> 05:22:57.718 align:start position:0%
that that challenge is being presented
 
05:22:59.930 --> 05:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
to the court and then the third one
 
05:23:03.590 --> 05:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
involves part one article 2B which is
 
05:23:06.170 --> 05:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
the governmental
 
05:23:08.330 --> 05:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
um the protection inherent in New
 
05:23:10.430 --> 05:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens personal and private
 
05:23:13.128 --> 05:23:13.138 align:start position:0%
data against unreasonable governmental
 
05:23:16.810 --> 05:23:16.820 align:start position:0%
intrusion and so in this case because
 
05:23:20.208 --> 05:23:20.218 align:start position:0%
the moderators and or members of the
 
05:23:22.190 --> 05:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office compile a
 
05:23:24.410 --> 05:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
list with names associated with
 
05:23:26.628 --> 05:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballot numbers and then later
 
05:23:28.730 --> 05:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
link those affidavit ballot numbers with
 
05:23:30.410 --> 05:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
the way in individual votes if they
 
05:23:33.170 --> 05:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
don't return ID there's a claim being
 
05:23:34.970 --> 05:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
presented to the court that that is a
 
05:23:36.230 --> 05:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
governmental intrusion into that
 
05:23:37.730 --> 05:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
personal private information of how
 
05:23:40.190 --> 05:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
someone votes so
 
05:23:42.050 --> 05:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't want to repeat what
 
05:23:43.670 --> 05:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
others have said except to say that it's
 
05:23:45.530 --> 05:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
my view and it continues to be our
 
05:23:47.208 --> 05:23:47.218 align:start position:0%
position that this law is
 
05:23:49.010 --> 05:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional for a myriad reasons
 
05:23:51.050 --> 05:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
and its unwise policy and it should be
 
05:23:52.730 --> 05:23:52.740 align:start position:0%
repealed so I'm happy to take any
 
05:23:52.740 --> 05:23:56.868 align:start position:0%
repealed so I'm happy to take any
questions

05:23:56.868 --> 05:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:59.208 --> 05:23:59.218 align:start position:0%
okay I I I'm surprised you're making out
 
05:24:01.010 --> 05:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
there with no questions but all right
 
05:24:04.128 --> 05:24:04.138 align:start position:0%
thank you last up is Liz tantarelli from
 
05:24:04.138 --> 05:24:05.208 align:start position:0%
thank you last up is Liz tantarelli from
Newbury

05:24:05.208 --> 05:24:05.218 align:start position:0%
Newbury
 
05:24:17.030 --> 05:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:19.310 --> 05:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
thank you again for allowing me to speak
 
05:24:21.590 --> 05:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
my name is Liz tentarelli I'm president
 
05:24:23.270 --> 05:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
of the nonpartisan League of Women
 
05:24:25.970 --> 05:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
Voters of New Hampshire and I live in
 
05:24:28.070 --> 05:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
the little town of Newbury
 
05:24:31.788 --> 05:24:31.798 align:start position:0%
uh 2 100 voters
 
05:24:34.310 --> 05:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
and we're all proud of voting and I've
 
05:24:36.350 --> 05:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
been in my town
 
05:24:38.948 --> 05:24:38.958 align:start position:0%
um a
 
05:24:42.470 --> 05:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
Trustee of the library for 12 years I'm
 
05:24:45.368 --> 05:24:45.378 align:start position:0%
not currently but I have been in my town
 
05:24:48.770 --> 05:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
so my written testimony includes a lot
 
05:24:52.730 --> 05:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
of my views on the original SB 418 bill
 
05:24:55.910 --> 05:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
and the League's objections to it but I
 
05:24:58.910 --> 05:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
want to focus on the fact that we've got
 
05:25:01.010 --> 05:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
a special election coming up in
 
05:25:01.020 --> 05:25:02.050 align:start position:0%
a special election coming up in
Rochester

05:25:02.050 --> 05:25:02.060 align:start position:0%
Rochester
 
05:25:05.990 --> 05:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
in three weeks we've got Town meetings
 
05:25:08.628 --> 05:25:08.638 align:start position:0%
coming up in towns like Newbury and many
 
05:25:11.390 --> 05:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
other towns in about six weeks
 
05:25:14.830 --> 05:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
now part of SB 418
 
05:25:18.070 --> 05:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
included a statement that
 
05:25:20.990 --> 05:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
training would be offered to the
 
05:25:23.150 --> 05:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist about how
 
05:25:27.110 --> 05:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
to handle people who were affected by SB
 
05:25:30.830 --> 05:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
418 not having ID with them at the polls
 
05:25:33.110 --> 05:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
on registration day
 
05:25:35.690 --> 05:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
so for that reason and a lot of other
 
05:25:37.910 --> 05:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
reasons I've been thinking about my town
 
05:25:40.730 --> 05:25:40.740 align:start position:0%
meeting coming up now we've got a big
 
05:25:44.448 --> 05:25:44.458 align:start position:0%
bond issue warrant article on our agenda
 
05:25:46.550 --> 05:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
this year we're trying to get a library
 
05:25:46.560 --> 05:25:47.930 align:start position:0%
this year we're trying to get a library
Edition

05:25:47.930 --> 05:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
Edition
 
05:25:50.270 --> 05:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
and we've been beating the bushes trying
 
05:25:52.310 --> 05:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
to get everybody who likes the library
 
05:25:54.890 --> 05:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
to come out and vote for it and that
 
05:25:57.770 --> 05:25:57.780 align:start position:0%
includes some people new to town
 
05:26:00.288 --> 05:26:00.298 align:start position:0%
so you know the the obvious thing is go
 
05:26:02.030 --> 05:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
and register so you can come to town
 
05:26:04.250 --> 05:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
meeting now I realize some of you here
 
05:26:07.310 --> 05:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
are from cities so you don't re you may
 
05:26:10.070 --> 05:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know but you don't realize that we
 
05:26:13.190 --> 05:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
have the election on March 14th election
 
05:26:16.010 --> 05:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
of town officers and so on
 
05:26:19.250 --> 05:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
often there's no competition for that in
 
05:26:21.470 --> 05:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
a small town like ours
 
05:26:24.110 --> 05:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
I wish I could say that I beat a lot of
 
05:26:26.090 --> 05:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
people when I ran for Trustee of the
 
05:26:28.368 --> 05:26:28.378 align:start position:0%
library but I didn't
 
05:26:31.390 --> 05:26:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:34.850 --> 05:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
but then the next night we have the
 
05:26:37.910 --> 05:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
business meeting and this is the purest
 
05:26:40.430 --> 05:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
form of democracy that we've got here in
 
05:26:43.850 --> 05:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
New England where the budget is voted on
 
05:26:47.628 --> 05:26:47.638 align:start position:0%
often with a hand count and the warrant
 
05:26:51.708 --> 05:26:51.718 align:start position:0%
articles are discussed and voted on and
 
05:26:54.890 --> 05:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
the library bond issue will be voted on
 
05:26:57.770 --> 05:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
so I started thinking about my neighbor
 
05:27:00.288 --> 05:27:00.298 align:start position:0%
who may or may not register ahead of
 
05:27:03.050 --> 05:27:03.060 align:start position:0%
time and what if my neighbor decides to
 
05:27:05.868 --> 05:27:05.878 align:start position:0%
register to vote brings his wife along
 
05:27:09.470 --> 05:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
and vote and and comes to the polls on
 
05:27:11.270 --> 05:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
that Wednesday night
 
05:27:13.910 --> 05:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
and his wife doesn't have her purse has
 
05:27:16.070 --> 05:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
no ID and so on
 
05:27:19.190 --> 05:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
will she be given a provisional ballot
 
05:27:21.530 --> 05:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
and how do we handle this at town
 
05:27:21.540 --> 05:27:22.610 align:start position:0%
and how do we handle this at town
meeting

05:27:22.610 --> 05:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
05:27:24.770 --> 05:27:24.780 align:start position:0%
now of course
 
05:27:27.470 --> 05:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
we we get these little colored things
 
05:27:30.050 --> 05:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
that we use as ballots for the bond
 
05:27:33.170 --> 05:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
issues so will those people get a
 
05:27:35.150 --> 05:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
different set of different colored
 
05:27:36.948 --> 05:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
little ballots
 
05:27:39.470 --> 05:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
and a lot of our voting is done by a
 
05:27:40.730 --> 05:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
hand count
 
05:27:44.330 --> 05:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering if orange mittens will
 
05:27:48.288 --> 05:27:48.298 align:start position:0%
be handed out for the provisional voters
 
05:27:51.288 --> 05:27:51.298 align:start position:0%
so that those votes can be discounted
 
05:27:51.298 --> 05:27:52.490 align:start position:0%
so that those votes can be discounted
later

05:27:52.490 --> 05:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
later
 
05:27:55.550 --> 05:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
I mean I realize this my prop is a
 
05:27:58.250 --> 05:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
little bit silly here but I think there
 
05:28:00.830 --> 05:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
may be some issues here
 
05:28:04.610 --> 05:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
and SB 418 was passed I think without
 
05:28:08.510 --> 05:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
any real need for it and so I am in
 
05:28:11.690 --> 05:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
support of SB 502
 
05:28:16.128 --> 05:28:16.138 align:start position:0%
to repeal us before 18 and if we could
 
05:28:18.650 --> 05:28:18.660 align:start position:0%
do it before those elections that would
 
05:28:20.150 --> 05:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
really be good
 
05:28:22.310 --> 05:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
I'll be glad to take questions if you
 
05:28:23.330 --> 05:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
have any
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
questions with committee
 
05:28:27.170 --> 05:28:27.180 align:start position:0%
