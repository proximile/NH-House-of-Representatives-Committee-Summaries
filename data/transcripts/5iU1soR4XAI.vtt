members are
 
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
present and the first thing I like to do
 
00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
is um discuss the field trip for for
 
00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
Friday um the last I got in my little
 
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
neck of the woods is 12 to 18 in
 
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.270 align:start position:0%
neck of the woods is 12 to 18 in
Thursday

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
Thursday
 
00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 align:start position:0%
afternoon and not only 12 to 18 but 12
 
00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
to 18 heavy I don't get your snowblower
 
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
out after 6 Ines get it out after 1 inch
 
00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 align:start position:0%
and so um I just soliciting feedback
 
00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
from those in the room to push it uh uh
 
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
a week or two does that absolutely I
 
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
think that makes sense does that make
 
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
sense to everyone in the room agreed
 
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
okay um so I I'll coordinate with them
 
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
after this meeting to push it is there a
 
00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
better date one or the
 
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
other um I think a Friday is a good day
 
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
yeah like to stick with a
 
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.270 align:start position:0%
yeah like to stick with a
Friday

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
and the 5th the 12th and the 19th what
 
00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 align:start position:0%
we push it to the 19th and then maybe
 
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
we're hopefully through the worst of the
 
00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
snow events uh it could be but I just
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:48.550 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 align:start position:0%
um looks
 
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
good yeah for and half yeah 19 okay U we
 
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
could look at the 19th is that good for
 
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
it and what
 
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
about I I cannot do the 26 um then the
 
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
only next date is the third of May for

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
it's third third of May or 19th those
 
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 align:start position:0%

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
any dire preference can you make the
 
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 align:start position:0%

Kathy May three yeah ma' yes good okay I
 
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
I'll talk to uh Waste Management about
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
the 3 of May
 
00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 align:start position:0%
versus this week okay
 
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
good and then um up first um this week
 
00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
we have Muriel Robinette from CX
 
00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:12.830 align:start position:0%
we have Muriel Robinette from CX
environmental

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
Consulting uh and then Dees following uh
 
00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:28.230 align:start position:0%
Consulting uh and then Dees following uh
CX

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
there you go there you go now it is okay
 
00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
good thank you very much I appreciate
 
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to be here um I
 
00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
also created a small handout which I
 
00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
think you
 
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 align:start position:0%
have uh a word about myself I'm a native
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right and I can remember
 
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
going to our town dump to watch the
 
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
Bears on Saturday
 
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
morning um
 
00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
it was a interesting experience because
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
every town had its own little
 
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
bump fast forward a little bit after
 
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
school college grad school Etc I ended
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
up moving back to New Hampshire and I
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
worked for the predecessor of the
 
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
at that time it was called the water
 
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
supply and Pollution Control Commission
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
back in the early
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
80s and I remember talking with uh a Mr
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
Sweeney who was head of the solid waste
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
group at that time and being the the
 
00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:40.879 align:start position:0%
newly hired hydrogeologist for the State
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to head the
 
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
hydrogeological investigation unit for
 
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.230 align:start position:0%
hydrogeological investigation unit for
the

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:50.919 align:start position:0%
state um he he said you know we we're
 
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
learning we as a state we're learning a
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
couple of things one is that it's
 
00:07:58.589 --> 00:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
probably not a good idea to put
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
landfills in a sand pit because
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
contamination migrates away pretty
 
00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:07.159 align:start position:0%
easily and second of all we're learning
 
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
that Bedrock is not impermeable what a
 
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
surprise since so many of our water
 
00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
supply Wells Drive their water out of
 
00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
Bedrock fractured Bedrock it's a
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
resource it's something we have to
 
00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639 align:start position:0%
understand and
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
protect so I've been a a hydrogeological
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
consultant in this state for the last 40
 
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
years I've done a lot of Investigation
 
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
work I've also had to do a lot of
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
remediation and cleanup work I've had to
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
understand collect the data and figure
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
out how to clean up
 
00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
contamination and so I'm pretty
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
passionate about how we deal with our
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
waste because our landfills thankfully
 
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
now are so much better better than what
 
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
we've ever ever ever had in the past but
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
we have a chance to do it right because
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have to have too
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
many we're luckily we're on a path with
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
our Solid Waste plan to reduce at the
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
source the amount of waste that New
 
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs to to landfill that's
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
our our choice of Last Resort to put it
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
in a
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
landfill and we don't have to have many
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
landfills to meet our needs
 
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
so these rules that are being evaluated
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
and as director whimet told us here's
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
our opportunity to make them better to
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
make them more protective to make them
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
able to protect human health and the
 
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
environment so this is an excellent
 
00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
excellent opportunity and I and I
 
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate the work of the department as
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
they try to balance what the needs are
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
within the state which
 
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
obviously are up for debate and what New
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a state can provide for
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
locations for disposal of waste so I
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
look at these rules and I'm looking for
 
00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:17.959 align:start position:0%
the additional protections because I
 
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
think that's important it's we know
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
better we know better and so we don't
 
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
need to create an area of contamination
 
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
for our grand grandchildren or a great
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
grandchildren to have to deal
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
with so let's dig into some of the
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
changes that they're
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
suggesting um the the biggest thing and
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about it for years
 
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
now in in this body as well as
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
scientifically is the fact
 
00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:50.550 align:start position:0%
scientifically is the fact
that

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:54.519 align:start position:0%
landfills create a lot of leachate they
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
create this contaminated liquid and we
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
do a wonderful job job engineering how
 
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
we manage and control and collect that
 
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
leee but we we have a weak link you've
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
heard the old term a chain is only as
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
strong as its weakest
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
link well we engineer the heck out of
 
00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
where we dispose of the solid waste
 
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
liners and all sorts of of engineered
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
systems which allow us to protect that
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
envelope that pile of waste that we put
 
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
there and then we move it over to
 
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
another spot at the site and we handle
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
it we store it we offload it we we've
 
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
got it in pipelines we have it in force
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
Ms and that's not very protected it's
 
00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:53.079 align:start position:0%
does not have the same kind of
 
00:11:57.629 --> 00:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
engineering controls and systems that
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
are actual weight based envelope exists
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
with so therefore that's a weak Link in
 
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
our sites and it would be prudent if we
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
either number
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
one picked a site where if we had spills
 
00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:19.079 align:start position:0%
or leaks from that waste handling area
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't go very far that would be
 
00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
one way of handling it the other way of
 
00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:28.839 align:start position:0%
handling it is whether or not you line
 
00:12:28.839 --> 00:12:30.230 align:start position:0%
handling it is whether or not you line
and

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
and test excuse me and create that same
 
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
sort of protective engineered envelope
 
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
in the area of your leate
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that's another op option
 
00:12:49.189 --> 00:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
obviously so when we look at these rules
 
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
there are several points here that I I'd
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
like to point out as to my concerns as
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
to how we want to be protective of human
 
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
health in the environment one relates to
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
groundwater protection how many of us
 
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
can our water supply out of a Bedrock
 
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
well many many people do more than 50%
 
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
of our water supplies come out of these
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
private individual Wells and yet the EnV
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
804 um
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
02 uh
 
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
Clause Is Now drafted such that we're
 
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
only concerned about what's the
 
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
hydraulic contivity in the top five fet
 
00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:35.079 align:start position:0%
of saturated material it's
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
silent on the issue of our Bedrock Water
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
Supplies now how could that
 
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
be why is the top five feet the only
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
thing that matters is it because maybe
 
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
there's something that's even
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
more I'm fine to have you interrupt me
 
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
as I'm going along it's up to up to you
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
so so I'm sorry go so uh ma'am if if you
 
00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
don't mind to finish this first section
 
00:14:04.269 --> 00:14:04.279 align:start position:0%
of your testimony and then we'll open it
 
00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:05.959 align:start position:0%
up for questions and then move on to the
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
next section okay does that work for you
 
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
yes that's fine with me I'm I'm
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
discussing the very first one that that
 
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
I have highlighted
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
here so this this particular clause and
 
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.389 align:start position:0%
here so this this particular clause and
the

00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
rules um currently is is not Quantified
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
as this um July 2014 current rules is
 
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
described it just basically says it
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be such that we can remediate
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
it prior to it arriving to a a water
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
body or to a water supply now they're
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
trying to quantify it and the the value
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
the hydraulic
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
contivity of what is being proposed is
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
that of sand and sand is what we use in
 
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
our leachate systems to facilitate flow
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
of waste water so it goes down into the
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
ground sand is very permeable sand
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
allows contaminants to move and and so
 
00:15:13.749 --> 00:15:13.759 align:start position:0%
from my personal p uh perspective as a
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist is like didn't we learn
 
00:15:21.069 --> 00:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
anything from Mr Sweeny back in 1985
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
when he said we don't put landfills in a
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
sand pit uh and I appreciate that we
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
have all the engineered double line
 
00:15:33.069 --> 00:15:33.079 align:start position:0%
triple Lin uh systems that are
 
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
protective of the waste itself but we
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
know that there is Lee releases that
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
occur we see it it's happening today and
 
00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
therefore why would we want to put our
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
pit repres Murray let represented po go
 
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
so my first question is can you like
 
00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:06.759 align:start position:0%
please speak to like how dangerous it is
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
that we're only um testing the first
 
00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:12.519 align:start position:0%
like 20 or 30 feet underneath the site
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
so the new rules don't say anything
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
about whether the applicant needs to
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
make any effort to test like the aquafer
 
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
where um where nearby drinking Wells are
 
00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
and all of that
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
um that's my biggest concern uh my
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
second biggest concern with how the
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
rules are right now the the um the rules
 
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
talk about the need for a
 
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.110 align:start position:0%
talk about the need for a
hydrogeological

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
hydrogeological
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
evaluation of a site and it doesn't
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
specifically describe that it needs to
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
be a three dimensional evaluation it
 
00:16:50.189 --> 00:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't note that all hydrographic units
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
have to be identified and
 
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
Quantified um it's it's somewhat vague
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
it just says you have to do a
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
hydrogeological study and and it's up to
 
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
the agency to determine when they have
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
enough information when it's
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
sufficient um I think this particular
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
piece of the rules was attempting to
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
Define some sort of a third dimension
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
some sort of AAP thing uh but five feet
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
is it doesn't is meaningless so I I
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
can't answer your question really well
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
on that um I I think it should
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
definitely require a full blown analysis
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
of the Water Supplies of the of the area
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
site um yes ma'am go ahead so I I don't
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
have a water well now but I did for you
 
00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:42.039 align:start position:0%
know a gazillion years living here in
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I've um born and raised
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
here as well um can you tell me on
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
average um I used to work for Capital
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
well clean water Center so I'm very
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
familiar with um uh artisian Wells and
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
Drilling and all of that kind of stuff
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know on average what the depth is
 
00:17:58.679 --> 00:17:59.510 align:start position:0%
uh you know on average what the depth is
uh

00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
for a water well in the state yes in New
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the Department of
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
Environmental services keeps data um on
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
the water wells that are drilled in the
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
state and about 300 feet is pretty
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
pretty average thank you very much okay
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you Mr
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
chairing thank you for taking my
 
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
question so I wanted to go back to
 
00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
Geometry for a minute and I'm thinking
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
in my head when we're talking about the
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
5T below the footprint I couldn't help
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
but think of of um two different visions
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
of either a trapezoid of some sort or a
 
00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
cylinder right of the footprint and the
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
the base could look quite different and
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking about the concentration
 
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
of materials right that could be at the
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
tallest point versus on the perimeter
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
where there's maybe not as much stuff
 
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
stacked up around on the landfill and
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
I'm curious to know whether or not the
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
density of the waist in the center
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
portion of what they're trying
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
to what what they're trying to get at
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
could be more toxic as we go this way
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
and then it Wicks outward so why would
 
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
we just say five feet directly
 
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
beneath the there are analyses that they
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
do in their design regarding the
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
stability of the base layer so that this
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
weight this material that's placed on it
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't create an unstable
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
situation the the system also is
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
designed and slop such that any liquids
 
00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
in It All Drain to to low points and
 
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
then are collected and pumped off so the
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
the leachate is controlled Within These
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
envelopes of the of the footprint
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
so follow up if I may I I guess that's
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
to my point um why would just five feet
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
directly beneath however be sufficient
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we be concerned in the event of
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
a leak that there would be potential for
 
00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
drift or migration out outside of the
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
footprint oh yes if if there is a leak
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
from the footprint of the landfill it
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
there's there's nothing to stop it at 5
 
00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
feet or moving laterally away from the
 
00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
footprint of the landfill the only thing
 
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
that really does is the site conditions
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
and if landfills were sighted in a silty
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
till material it doesn't want to go very
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
far and so that's gets back back to the
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
the sighting criteria that if we utilize
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
mother nature to help us contain any
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
releases that we may have it's not going
 
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
to go very far if it travels very very
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
slowly which was the whole point of
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
looking at at travel times to sensitive
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
receptors whether it was a a well or
 
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
river or a lake or some public water
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
supply thank you any other questions on
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
this area representative ger thank you
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you very much for taking
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
my question so as I understand that one
 
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
of the explanations for this distinction
 
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
between the insitu site right as opposed
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
to then the developed site and having
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
these what are demonstrably weaker
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
standards now for the insitu site is the
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
argument that this double
 
00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
lined uh engineering is
 
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
certainly much better than unline but
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
but can you speak to how um how often we
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
see leaks even in double line facilities
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
I mean is this a is this a Panacea is
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
this a cure all or uh if we
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
have uh the the hydraulic conductivity
 
00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
of The Institute site is not a place
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
where we would put a
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
landfill should we just rest assured
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
that having a double liner above that is
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
going to solve all of our
 
00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
problems well I don't think we have a
 
00:22:06.669 --> 00:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
lot of data in our tiny little state but
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
I know that the Environmental Protection
 
00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
Agency has been looking at and
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
researching and
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
evaluating the the so-called
 
00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art double Lin landfill
 
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
systems all over the United States and
 
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
their conclusion is is that leaks
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
definitely do
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
occur um the what we've experienced
 
00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
obviously in New Hampshire is the fact
 
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:33.400 align:start position:0%
that you know we handle a lot of leee it
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
rains here a lot in case we haven't all
 
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
noticed how much it rains and when
 
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
they're handling the waste and putting
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
it in the the cells and whatever we
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
create a lot of Lee and that leachate is
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
handled outside of the engineered
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
controlled areas and that is the weak
 
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
Link in our chain for a site that's
 
00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
permeable I I if if we have to locate a
 
00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:02.919 align:start position:0%
landfill in a sand pit again let's
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
listen to Mr Sweeny and say let's try
 
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799 align:start position:0%
not to do it in the first place but if
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
we have to then we should have
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
engineered controls so that the leachate
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
handling area is as protected as as
 
00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
engineered and monitored as much as the
 
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
actual waste disposal thank you very
 
00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:24.039 align:start position:0%
much okay ma'am um if you don't mind
 
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
going on to your second point that would
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
be great yes yeah I'm certainly fine
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
with that um the second Point relates to
 
00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:33.559 align:start position:0%
the whole issue of of a setback um our
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
rules currently say you know we need to
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
the the footprint of the landfill can't
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
be within 200 fet of a water body of any
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
perennial surface water body and I'm
 
00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
reading from the column to the left and
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
then we have started to make a change
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
and said oh let's make it 500 ft well
 
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
500 ft is better than 200t but is that
 
00:23:59.310 --> 00:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
enough and when you look at a hydraulic
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
conductivity possibly being allowed of 3
 
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:05.559 align:start position:0%
feet per day 500 feet doesn't even give
 
00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
us a year before contamination
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
potentially could reach a a water body
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of close possibly too if
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to site in that sort of a
 
00:24:20.269 --> 00:24:20.279 align:start position:0%
sand pit um now the rules are written so
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
we went back to 200 feet for first and
 
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
second order streams and then 500 ft for
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
everything else and my observation of
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
this is that it's pretty
 
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:34.919 align:start position:0%
meaningless to say any of these
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
distances 200 to 500 fee it's
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
meaningless because we're considering
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
allowing our next site possibly to be in
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
a sand pit so there's just not the time
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
sufficient to find and stop the releases
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
that can occur in an unprotected area if
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
you have surface water bodies that are
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
away any
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative ger thank you
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh and thank you again for
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question so the the question
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
that I have asked uh over and over again
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
kind of ad nauseum at this point is why
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
we're using feet instead of of some
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
travel time right so a three year five
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
year whatever n understand we've had
 
00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:32.200 align:start position:0%
some discussion that uh the argument can
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
be made that that two or 500 feet on a
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
quote unquote average site equates to a
 
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
certain amount of travel time uh but
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
that is obviously not site specific
 
00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
right I mean that's just an average
 
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0%
based upon what we know about sites Etc
 
00:25:48.669 --> 00:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
but so do you have a view
 
00:25:48.679 --> 00:25:50.269 align:start position:0%
but so do you have a view
on

00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
whether uh it is better to have this
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
setback distance in terms of feet or in
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
terms of of travel
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
time it's my opinion that it definitely
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
should be travel time and it is in other
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
states um Fe feed are arbitrary unless
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
unless the state's going to decide
 
00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.590 align:start position:0%
unless the state's going to decide
specifically

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:26:16.389 --> 00:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
where sites are going to be acceptable
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
or not and and they know that 500 ft is
 
00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:22.919 align:start position:0%
good that's something that can address
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
but I I really think travel time is the
 
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
way to go because that site specific and
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
it's not like we we locate 10 of these a
 
00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
year we we locate one very seldom and
 
00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
and carefully and and I know everybody
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
puts a lot of thought into it but um
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
these these arbitrary distances are
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
really meaningless thank you okay and
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
representative muray uh uh thank you Mr
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
chair I I did want to I'm referring back
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
to a document that the department had
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
put out on uh I believe
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
believe this would have been September
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
of 2017 and where they are classifying
 
00:27:04.919 --> 00:27:06.070 align:start position:0%
of 2017 and where they are classifying
stream

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
stream
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
nominations and um it is and they talk
 
00:27:11.549 --> 00:27:11.559 align:start position:0%
about stream orders being defined based
 
00:27:13.389 --> 00:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
on the hierarchy of tributaries and one
 
00:27:14.669 --> 00:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
of the things that they note is that
 
00:27:16.029 --> 00:27:16.039 align:start position:0%
first order streams are Headwater
 
00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
streams second order streams are formed
 
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
with the Confluence of two first order
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
streams so essentially it is putting two
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
first order streams together for a
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
second order stream and I guess I'm
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
confused as to why we would even be
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
considering um 200t for types
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
of primary bodies of water source any
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
any whether we're talking about first
 
00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
second or third so I don't know um if
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
you can speak
 
00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
to again I guess going back to both
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
representative gerana and uh
 
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
representative penza's questions about
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
why 200 ft would even be an appropriate
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
Choice well it's 200 fet now is is what
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
the rules say the ones that are in
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
existence and they and they don't
 
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
attempt to do anything about first order
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
second order third order whatever they
 
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
just see any
 
00:28:14.909 --> 00:28:14.919 align:start position:0%
perennial water um body that's correct
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
and the the the version before drafted
 
00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.310 align:start position:0%
and the the the version before drafted
on

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:28:21.149 --> 00:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
10623 went to 500 and I
 
00:28:25.149 --> 00:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
guess the conversation is perhaps in HB
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
56 is that correct we had initially
 
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
tried distance to travel is that correct
 
00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:32.519 align:start position:0%
corre um and so now in the rules
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
drafting we're back to this conversation
 
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
around feet is what I guess I I I don't
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
know why it would change back you need
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
to ask the agency why they're thinking
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
they need to go back to less protective
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
because these rules in
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
general at least with respect to the
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
natural conditions are definitely
 
00:28:57.509 --> 00:28:57.519 align:start position:0%
weakening as far as distances and
 
00:28:57.519 --> 00:28:59.190 align:start position:0%
weakening as far as distances and
hydraulic

00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
hydraulic
 
00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:01.519 align:start position:0%
conductivities thank
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
you all right and final point please the
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
the final Point relates to the landfill
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
subgrade and base grade and again this
 
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
this is tied to the footprint it's tied
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
to the engineered areas and
 
00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
they proposed at one time of having a a
 
00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
a more stringent lower denser hydraulic
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
conductivity layer that would be
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
obviously a safeguard for any releases
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
through the the lined system and and
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
then it changed again back to 10 the
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
minus 4th instead of 10 to the minus 5th
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
um I guess I wouldn't understand why
 
00:29:51.549 --> 00:29:51.559 align:start position:0%
we'd be going back if it's something
 
00:29:53.789 --> 00:29:53.799 align:start position:0%
that we can engineer why not have it be
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
more more conservative why not have it
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
be more imper able um and let's require
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
it throughout the landfill site
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
including the infrastructure area
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
because that would help stop that
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
migration of contaminants that we know
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
are going to at some time where all
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
human could be released from the
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
site yes ma'am thank you thank you and
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
question a lot of this science is
 
00:30:32.509 --> 00:30:32.519 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar to me but that last Point
 
00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:35.799 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sense to me because I can
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
understand the fact that we need greater
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
protection rather than lesser and isn't
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
it true that other states have these
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
numbers that provide greater
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
protection yes they absolutely do some
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
even go to 10 the minus 7 cm per second
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
as a requirement and and if it's an
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
average doesn't that mean that other
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
parts of the site are going to
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
be more porous more less protective with
 
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
that number yes they they it can be less
 
00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
protective in areas and so on average
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's right able to meet that standard
 
00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.190 align:start position:0%
it's right able to meet that standard
thank

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
you repr jam thank you Mr chair uh so
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask uh because I'm an
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
academic you're an academic I'm G to ask
 
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
a big bigger kind of question and that
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
has to do with the geology of the state
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
one of the points of contention here is
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
is the idea that the stricted standards
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
somehow mean that you can never site a
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
landfill uh in the state of New
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when we talk about the the
 
00:31:48.029 --> 00:31:48.039 align:start position:0%
requirements in Maine then again the
 
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
response is not only is this not Maine I
 
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
get that but that somehow the inference
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
seems to me that somehow New Hampshire
 
00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
is dramatically geologically different
 
00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
from Maine so that whereas they could
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
site a landfill at 10 to theg 5th in
 
00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:03.559 align:start position:0%
Maine somehow it is not possible in New
 
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so could could you give us a a
 
00:32:07.629 --> 00:32:07.639 align:start position:0%
very quick kind of lesson in in the
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
geology of the region because I do
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
understand like Vermont and and and New
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are significantly different
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
right geologically because of how the
 
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
land mass comes together so uh could
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
could you speak a little bit to the
 
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
underlying kind of geography geology in
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire how it compares to the
 
00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
region as a whole and perhaps
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
specifically if possible to to
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
Maine one of the common denominators
 
00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
that we have in New England is the fact
 
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
that we had a a continental glacier that
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
came down and the glacier certainly the
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
Bedrock and the different types of
 
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
sediments that make up the Bedrock are
 
00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
different when you go from different
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
states and that's that is a a a definite
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
but what these rules are talking about
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
is all about the spicial geology it's
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
all about what soil what granula
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
material was laid down by the glacier
 
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
and its
 
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
meltwaters and the glacial lakes that
 
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
happened and there are actually great
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
similarities because this continent
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
Glacier when it came down out of Canada
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
created a layer of Basil till which is a
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
clayr silty heavy dense material that
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
smeared over our Bedrock features it
 
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
also carved out where the weak areas
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
were in the Rocks we end up with some
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
lovely Lakes such as you know Squam Lake
 
00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.750 align:start position:0%
lovely Lakes such as you know Squam Lake
winaki

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
winaki
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
Etc and then when this big continental
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
glacier melted back it went all the way
 
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
down to Long Island and the whole island
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
of Long Island is really the end of a
 
00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.669 align:start position:0%
of Long Island is really the end of a
glacier

00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
glacier
 
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
um when it melted back it it is called o
 
00:34:04.629 --> 00:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
blasion till and that's from the
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
meltwaters and we end up with these nice
 
00:34:09.149 --> 00:34:09.159 align:start position:0%
little round Kettle holes because a big
 
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
chunk of ice melted in a spot and you
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
have the Sands and gravels deposited
 
00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
around it but that till is still there
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
and the till is silty and it's low
 
00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
permeability and it exists very much on
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
that north and west sides of all over of
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
our Hills they're called drumlins we
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
have them all in this state so does
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
Vermont so does
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
Maine and that has low permeability
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
material and we we don't have to site
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
landfills in oopy where we have this
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
nice sand and gravel uh oblan outwash
 
00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:52.599 align:start position:0%
material we could choose to do it in
 
00:34:52.599 --> 00:34:53.470 align:start position:0%
material we could choose to do it in
this

00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:34:56.829 --> 00:34:56.839 align:start position:0%
till and it's it's here all in New
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
England is it Michigan I mean anywhere
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
we've had these continental glaciers we
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
have that
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
material and we could use it to our
 
00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:08.599 align:start position:0%
advantage if we choose
 
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
to may I follow up um yes one follow up
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
please thank you so is it safe to say
 
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
from that I appreciate that very much uh
 
00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:17.720 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is not somehow
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
magically different from the region
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
around us in terms of our ability to
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
site landfills on appropriate soils I
 
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
don't think it's different I've worked
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
in Maine I've worked in Vermont New
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Massachusetts Connecticut
 
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island on
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
landfills so I don't see it as being an
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
outlier it's just our
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
choice thank you very much thank you Mr
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
chair all right and represented
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
poten so that kind of goes into my um
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
next question so um director whims had
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
told us in one of these other meetings
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
that um I would and this is quoting I
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
would seriously ly doubt that landfill
 
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
sighted and operated in Maine right now
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
meet a 10 to theg5 standard and then he
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
said I mean it's very unlikely so you've
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
obviously worked with landfill sighting
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
in Maine so do you think that um
 
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
director whimet is right that main has a
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
hundredfold Stricker standard than Dees
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
um proposed in January uh for us um but
 
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
that they don't enforce
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
it well my experience as a consultant in
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
Maine working for Central Maine Power
 
00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
one of the major companies in Maine was
 
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
that we were absolutely held to that
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
standard um that was back in the
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
90s uh I can't directly answer that
 
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:46.839 align:start position:0%
question for today but I would think
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
that could be found out if that was an
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
important question for you just call The
 
00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
Regulators okay thank you and any
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%

um so a couple of things if I could have
 
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
sent you a note but my my mind wasn't in
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
it um so if you could give us an update
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
on the timeline of so where you're at in
 
00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
the processing sure um and then update
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
on any rules that have mod you that
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
you're considering modifying based on
 
00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.790 align:start position:0%
you're considering modifying based on
your

00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
last um draft
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
sure and then
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
um any response to the three things
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about this
 
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
morning and then finally I have um
 
00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
representative Murray has a a question
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
she'd asked um it's not secret but it
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
skipped my mind so was what was your oh
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
incident reporting oh yeah incident
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
reporting okay um which we had talked
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
about earlier as part of a
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
separate deal but you guys are going to
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
work on it in the interum does that is
 
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
that okay does that make sense that
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
would be fine and over to you sir uh
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr chairman members of the
 
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh for the record my name
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
is Mike whimet I serve as director of
 
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
the waste management division for the
 
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and I'm joined
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
this morning by uh leam McKenna who
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
serves as the bureau chief of our uh
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Management Bureau and we're
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh pleased to be before for you this
 
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
morning uh so just to update you from
 
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
our last update um I believe we were
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
last here on March 6th and that was
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
shortly after we had uh been before our
 
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
Waste Management council with a proposed
 
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
uh set of the rules it was our second
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
time before the council um and then they
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
had met subsequent to that to um uh
 
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
express some concerns and it's and
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
submitted a letter to us which I think I
 
00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
I discussed in in in the last meeting
 
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
here um so um on the heels of that
 
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
letter which expressed some significant
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
concerns of the waste management Council
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
regarding the potential impact of these
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
rules um we went back and and reviewed
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
those rules and we made some proposed
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
additional changes um where we're at
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
right now in the process is that that uh
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
proposed version of the rules we went
 
00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
back to the Council on um uh March
 
00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
21st and we with they so that was our
 
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
third time at the counc
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
and uh we uh submitted to them a
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
proposed draft of the rules which we
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
intend to to um enter into the formal
 
00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process and so the first step
 
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
in that process is to uh make a request
 
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
for a fiscal impact statement from the
 
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant and I
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
believe that that is likely to happen
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
today or tomorrow that's just in in
 
00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
process uh within the department but is
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
expected to go over um probably today or
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and then once that happens the
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh legislative budget assistant will
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
prepare a fiscal impact statement
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
that'll come back to us and then um if
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
they based on that we will then file a
 
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
rulemaking notice with the uh office of
 
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
legislative services and that will kick
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
off uh along with that rulemaking notice
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
that notice will
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
include scheduling of a public hearing
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
and and a date a date and time for a
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
public hearing we would hold that public
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
hearing hearing and then that would
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
likely be followed by uh a public
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
comment period where folks who could
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
could also submit written testimony with
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
respect to the rules and then we would
 
00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:11.079 align:start position:0%
review that review the oral testimony
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
received ining the public hearing and
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
develop a final proposal which would
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
then be filed with the uh joint
 
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
 
00:41:22.349 --> 00:41:22.359 align:start position:0%
rules that um given the the passage of
 
00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
time here we are unlikely to meet our uh
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
July one deadline for finalizing the
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
rules however because we will have begun
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
the formal rulemaking process our
 
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
existing rules would remain in place um
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
as long as we were proceeding a pace um
 
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
with the formal rulemaking process so
 
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
our expectation on schedule right now is
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
that we would uh uh be filing a final
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
rule making um Proposal with the joint
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
rules probably sometime in June um and
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
that um or or July and that that would
 
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
get us to a meeting of that group in
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
July or August so that the rules would
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
be finalized um shortly thereafter it's
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
hard to I'm being a little bit uh uh uh
 
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
imprecise because I can't say for sure
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
what those dates will be but that's I
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to give the committee an idea of
 
00:42:19.549 --> 00:42:19.559 align:start position:0%
what that schedule would look like so
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's where we're at at this point um
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
we did send to to the subcommittee
 
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
members and to representative kraton on
 
00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
March 28th a copy of the rules the
 
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
proposed rules that we submitted and F
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh and presented to the council um back
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
in March or in on March 21st and um that
 
00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:44.839 align:start position:0%
version includes it's it's a red we sent
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
two we sent the actual straightup clean
 
00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:51.559 align:start position:0%
proposal but also a track changes copy
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
which includes the changes that were
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
proposed um since the February submitt
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
to the council
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
um but also um uh actually probably also
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
includes a few changes that were made
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
between the January and February
 
00:43:08.549 --> 00:43:08.559 align:start position:0%
meetings so I apologize if that's
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
confusing but we've got so many dates
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
going here it's been a little bit
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
difficult to make sure we got the right
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
um you know we we strike out all the
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
changes that were made prior and then
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
include all the changes so it's a little
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
bit of a little bit muddled there but it
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
it still I think is a good record for
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee's use of the changes
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
that we've made at the very least since
 
00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
that since that first January proposal
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
to the council so I hope that's that's
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
helpful in understanding where we're at
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
um there are uh you know I think the
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
that Redline version presents the best
 
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity for you to see what changes
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
and you know understand what those are
 
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
um I won't go over all of them there are
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
a handful of them that uh we made that I
 
00:43:53.309 --> 00:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
that I can summarize and then if you
 
00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
have questions about any of those or or
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
any of the other ones we we're certainly
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
willing to to entertain those um in uh
 
00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.430 align:start position:0%
willing to to entertain those um in uh
section

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
804 um
 
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
02c we adjusted that for clarity that
 
00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
would allow the requirement to be more
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
readily implemented while remaining
 
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
protective by adding a depth to which
 
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
the requirement applies and and keep in
 
00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
mind that um what we're doing then is
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
you know we're setting a floor we're
 
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
saying because the the regulated party's
 
00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:25.559 align:start position:0%
got to look at this and say okay what is
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
it I have to do what do I have to show
 
00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
so we have to set a floor that says
 
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
here's what at a minimum you need to
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
show and um I I would also note that the
 
00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
change to the hydraulic conductivity
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
that was submitted in that section um
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
was proposed in the February draft of
 
00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
the rules that was presented to the
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
council that was not changed more
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
recently that was changed between the
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
January and the February submittals just
 
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
for for reference
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
purposes one second please sure could we
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
just stop there for a moment and because
 
00:44:56.589 --> 00:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
I think we want to take these from the
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
same sort of manner that we did with um
 
00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
Miss Robinette okay and so if we can
 
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
talk sort of about the Institue soils
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
and the five foot change is that sure
 
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
yeah it's at the committee's pleasure
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
okay please um thank you so um thank you
 
00:45:15.309 --> 00:45:15.319 align:start position:0%
for that um one of the things that I
 
00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
would like to kind of focus on was what
 
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
I understand that insitu soil is
 
00:45:20.119 --> 00:45:22.150 align:start position:0%
I understand that insitu soil is
undisturbed

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
undisturbed
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
but what was the sort
 
00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:27.829 align:start position:0%
but what was the sort
of

00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
thought behind adding immediately below
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
without respect to any sort of given
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
perimeter on the exterior of the
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
footprint um or a proposed site and I
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
guess I guess I am trying to understand
 
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
how five feet was the number that was
 
00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.510 align:start position:0%
how five feet was the number that was
arrived

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
arrived
 
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:49.240 align:start position:0%
at well I mean these things are
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
difficult because you got to if you're
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
going to set a floor you got to you got
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
to pick a number right you got to you
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
got to say what does this apply to and
 
00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:57.670 align:start position:0%
got to say what does this apply to and
um

00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
you know we do have geology that's very
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
variable it changes with depth and with
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
with laterally um I I'll try to address
 
00:46:08.589 --> 00:46:08.599 align:start position:0%
your questions I guess in order um in
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
terms of the footprint the footprint of
 
00:46:12.589 --> 00:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
the landfill is what we often use that's
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
the most important to us in terms of
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
understanding what are we building a
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
landfill on what is it you know if we do
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
have a release what is the first soils
 
00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
that that that release sees so both in
 
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
terms of our design criteria as well as
 
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
sighting criteria with respect to in
 
00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
situ soils we're looking to understand
 
00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:32.599 align:start position:0%
what is beneath the footprint um it is
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
true that there are there are you know
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
in particular leech eight is managed and
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
storm water is managed outside the
 
00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
footprint of the landfill and we do have
 
00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
a number of Provisions in the rules that
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
that seek to make sure that that is
 
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
accomplished in as protective a manner
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
as possible um but from a practical
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
standpoint in terms of sighting um we
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
have to place some limits somewhere and
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
that's where the limits replaced um when
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
we do manage leech eight outside the
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
footprint we've improved the the rules
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
and the protection protectiveness of the
 
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
rules by uh requiring additional design
 
00:47:11.069 --> 00:47:11.079 align:start position:0%
and Engineering criteria that make the
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
management and transportation and
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
handling of that leech safer follow for
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
a followup uh thank you I guess my
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
um even when you look at other things
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
outside of this department when you look
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
at building below uh a ground um Frost
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
heaving MH permeability of those types
 
00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
of things movement in the ground um
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
there is a certain depth at which you
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
have to get to to prevent heaving of any
 
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
kind and I guess is there any concern
 
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
that an arbitrary number of five feet is
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
not achieving that and there could be
 
00:47:50.109 --> 00:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
additional movement well separate and
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
apart from these criteria which are
 
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
really looking at the permeability of
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
the soils um we look at the overall um
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
strength of the soils and structural
 
00:48:02.109 --> 00:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
Integrity of soils of the in place
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
formation um there's a obviously we want
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
to make sure that when a landfill is
 
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
designed and constructed and operated
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
that it's stable that it's not going to
 
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
have any kind of catastrophic failure as
 
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
a result of soils being um unsuitable
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
beneath it so that's part of the overall
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
review of the um hydrogeology of the of
 
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
the landfill and the GE and the geologic
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
setting so um that's I think the
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
strength the soils is a separate issue
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
really that's not really what this rule
 
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
is trying to get
 
00:48:39.069 --> 00:48:39.079 align:start position:0%
to and um I I'm sorry I could we just
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that according to these
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
rules that we could be placing the
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
landfills on
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
Sand is that how would you respond to
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
that sure so and I understand that
 
00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
concern I mean I think as um Miss
 
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
Robinette uh correctly pointed out we
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
have a set of rules now that doesn't set
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
a specific numerical standard it doesn't
 
00:49:03.309 --> 00:49:03.319 align:start position:0%
set any specification for the quality of
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
those soils it has general information
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
saying that or or a general requirement
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
that is more about overall performance
 
00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
that that basically reads that the
 
00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
landfill needs to be cited in a location
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
where release can be monitored detected
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
monitored and addressed before it has an
 
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
adverse impact on on surface water that
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
part of the rule I want want to note is
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
still in there that that those that
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
language is still in there our
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologists and Engineers who are
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
reviewing an application can still use
 
00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
that as a basis for making a
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
determination about whether citing of a
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
proposed landfill meets meets the rule
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
so that's I would suggest a belt and
 
00:49:47.309 --> 00:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
suspenders over and above this minimum
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
floor criteria that that says you've got
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
to have you know uh uh soil that meets
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
the 5 time 10 the minus 3 standard
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
immediately beneath the landfill um so
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
the reality is that as as I think I
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
testified in an earlier meeting there
 
00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
are a whole sort a whole set of criteria
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
that um someone who's looking to site
 
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
and construct a landfill needs to meet
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
some of them are about geology and about
 
00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:19.559 align:start position:0%
setting um geologic setting but some of
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
them are other more practical
 
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
considerations you know is the is the
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
landfill located near major
 
00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:26.799 align:start position:0%
transportation routes is it located in
 
00:50:29.309 --> 00:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
an area where um it makes sense to cite
 
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
a landfill for the waste that it's going
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
to be be disposed of um there a whole
 
00:50:35.789 --> 00:50:35.799 align:start position:0%
bunch of things that need to go into
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
that and as a result what we were
 
00:50:39.309 --> 00:50:39.319 align:start position:0%
hearing and we heard some concerns
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
expressed from the council as well as
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
from the solid waste industry that um
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
that when you look at that sort of all
 
00:50:48.789 --> 00:50:48.799 align:start position:0%
those criteria that need to come
 
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
together in order to identify a location
 
00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
where you can site a landfill um what we
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
had originally been proposing was was
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
likely too stringent to really make that
 
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
practicable or cost effective and so um
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're look as Miss robinet
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
indicated what we're doing here is
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
trying to balance um making sure we end
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
up with a set of rules that is more
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
protective and I'm very confident that
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
this these rules are more protective
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
than the current rules that we have um
 
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
and also making sure that it's still
 
00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
possible to site construct and operate a
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
landfill and to do so um in a manner
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
that provides for capacity for the
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
people of the state to have a place for
 
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
their waste to be disposed
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
of um one sec yes one second
 
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
sorry okay so I'm gonna have to read
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
this because I uh wrote this earlier so
 
00:51:52.829 --> 00:51:52.839 align:start position:0%
um so realizing that the agency has now
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
weakened it's even weakest
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
one times 10 the -3 three times since
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
January so for example in February it
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
weakened it in two ways raising it a
 
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
fivefold more to 5 time 10 the3 but also
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
allowing the developer to meet the
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
Criterion on average which of course
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
means that part of the site could be far
 
00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:21.109 align:start position:0%
means that part of the site could be far
more

00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
porous even than this 15 feet per day
 
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
value which it you know just one aspect
 
00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:29.720 align:start position:0%
of it doesn't meet that Criterion
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
because that's the whole point point of
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
making it weaker with average so as long
 
00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:35.799 align:start position:0%
as the other parts were less so so then
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
in March it added the words for 5 feet
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
immediately below footprint which the
 
00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
representative was talking about which
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
means that the first 5T of soil could
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
transmit liquid
 
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
downward in as little as eight hours
 
00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
onethird of a day and then encounter
 
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
even more porous soil than
 
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:00.839 align:start position:0%
that how in any way could you guys
 
00:53:04.589 --> 00:53:04.599 align:start position:0%
justify that except for having another
 
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
having a permit application in front of
 
00:53:11.549 --> 00:53:11.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.109 --> 00:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
criteria well on the is first on the
 
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
issue of average the the average um
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
provision is in there because the
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
reality is that our our um geology is
 
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
not um not homogeneous there's there for
 
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
over a large site over you know a
 
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
landfill that might be proposed over I
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
don't know 25 50 acres um you're not
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
going to have necessarily at every
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
location and at every depth um the same
 
00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
soil quality and so in many cases you
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
may have what amount to
 
00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
meaningless variations in the soil
 
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
quality they're very small but that
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
there was some suggestion that if one
 
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
sample didn't meet a particular standard
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
then that would exclude the entire site
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
and that from a practical standpoint we
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
just didn't think that was really um a
 
00:54:03.069 --> 00:54:03.079 align:start position:0%
meaningful provision and that would that
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
would be that would be helpful and so we
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
felt that average needed to be placed in
 
00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:10.839 align:start position:0%
there and that that's going to mean that
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to need to have some soils
 
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
that are in many cases more protect more
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
less permeable but you might have a few
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
locations where small areas or lenses of
 
00:54:22.789 --> 00:54:22.799 align:start position:0%
soils are a little bit more permeable
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
and that's just a a pract you know as a
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
regulator you need to be practical
 
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
enough to know that you can Implement a
 
00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
rule in a way that does not um
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
essentially exclude every site from
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
being able to comply because of a small
 
00:54:39.549 --> 00:54:39.559 align:start position:0%
imperfection in the or or inconsistency
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
in the soil quality so that's where the
 
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:45.640 align:start position:0%
issue of the average comes from um you
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
know we have um existing landfills in
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
the state that when they expand they are
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
required to meet the sighting criteria
 
00:54:56.349 --> 00:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
um for that expansion because they're
 
00:54:58.349 --> 00:54:58.359 align:start position:0%
expanding their footprint and the
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
expectation is is that we're going to
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
write rules that um everybody can and
 
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
will need to comply with and so um you
 
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
know there are the reality is that we do
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
have a number of landfills that are
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
cited in locations um that are not
 
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
perfect they're not um all 10 Theus 6 um
 
00:55:21.549 --> 00:55:21.559 align:start position:0%
or 10 Theus 5 tight tills they're just
 
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
not and um that's the reality and that
 
00:55:28.109 --> 00:55:28.119 align:start position:0%
goes again to that issue of well where
 
00:55:29.789 --> 00:55:29.799 align:start position:0%
you know where do all those criteria
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
that need to come together to site a
 
00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
landfill where do they intersect in a
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
way that allows you to sight a landfill
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
so we're setting a floor here it doesn't
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
mean that future sighted landfills if
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
there are any um aren't going to be um
 
00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
you know aren't going to meet the
 
00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
standard and go well beyond the standard
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
but we knew we do when we're writing
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
rules we need to have a floor that says
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
okay this is the minimum that you've got
 
00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
to meet
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
and one followup
 
00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
please um I appreciate your answer and I
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
think that what you just spoke on um is
 
00:56:09.029 --> 00:56:09.039 align:start position:0%
so important why I think it's very
 
00:56:11.029 --> 00:56:11.039 align:start position:0%
different than a landfill that is
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
currently active and um in in doing all
 
00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
of the right things that is you know a
 
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
potential might expand at some point why
 
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
are their rules the exact same as
 
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
someone shouldn't they have separate
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
criteria versus we're literally citing
 
00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
brand new there should be why aren't we
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
doing that what we should be doing that
 
00:56:38.109 --> 00:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
we're spending all of this time on new
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
rules I believe there should be a a
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
cutout or a carve out for current
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
landfills in operation um in knowing
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
that because you're right nothing's
 
00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:51.160 align:start position:0%
perfect I just think that when we have
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
something that is so
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
non-restrictive or nonprotective Ive um
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
that you could basically look at this
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
and almost sight a landfill anywhere I
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
understand it it's not specific there
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
could be one piece of the um you know of
 
00:57:09.029 --> 00:57:09.039 align:start position:0%
the property that is uh pores or
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
whatever that's not good um soil but to
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
me it's it's two separate things this is
 
00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
you know new sighting landfill should be
 
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
separately from somebody's that's
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
looking for an expansion why aren't we
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
looking at that the the department has
 
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other departments that
 
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
do the department has approached these
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
rules and it's certainly the case for
 
00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
landfills that have already been
 
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
designed and constructed and are
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
operating and there are many examples in
 
00:57:38.349 --> 00:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
these rules where we impose a new design
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
or construction or operation Criterion
 
00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
that simply can't be met for that
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
existing landfill and we do make
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
provision for that in the rules because
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
that's only fair but we believe that
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
when a landfill is going to be expanded
 
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
when its footprint is going to be
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
expanded that the people who live in
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
that Community deserve the same
 
00:57:59.789 --> 00:57:59.799 align:start position:0%
protections of sighting design um and
 
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
construction of anybody that might live
 
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
in an area where a new landfill is going
 
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
to be cited we don't believe that
 
00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
because they happen to have a landfill
 
00:58:10.589 --> 00:58:10.599 align:start position:0%
in their Community they don't deserve
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
the same protections with respect to
 
00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
expansion of that facility so what we're
 
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
trying to do here is write rules that um
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
are and I believe we've succeeded we're
 
00:58:23.029 --> 00:58:23.039 align:start position:0%
we're writing rules that are protective
 
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
that can be protective of the
 
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
environment of groundwater and surface
 
00:58:28.829 --> 00:58:28.839 align:start position:0%
water quality and of people living near
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
a facility whether that facility is
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
already existing and wants to expand or
 
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's a brand new Greenfield site
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
where someone wants to propose a new
 
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
landfill representative H Haskins thank
 
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
question all along as we've been talking
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
about this I have had a concern that the
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
regulated Community as you refer to
 
00:58:58.510 --> 00:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
them is is responsible for why these
 
00:58:59.950 --> 00:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
rules are
 
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
weakening uh that never made any sense
 
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
to me is that the way the sausage is
 
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
made I don't know but as as a legislator
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
bound Duty bound to protect the
 
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
public I can't see that the regulated
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
Community should be the ones that design
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
these rules to be weaker than they
 
00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
should be and even initially look like
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
they could be can you explain that to me
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
so the regulated Community does not
 
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
design the rules they don't write the
 
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
rules um they are a part of the group of
 
00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
folks that we speak to because they and
 
00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
that's true with all of our rules across
 
00:59:47.069 --> 00:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
the department and it is the case that
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
you know there are areas the rules that
 
00:59:51.029 --> 00:59:51.039 align:start position:0%
we we try to write things things that
 
00:59:52.349 --> 00:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
maybe this committee is not even
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
interested in where we just got it wrong
 
00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:56.440 align:start position:0%
where we misunderstood something about
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
the way the facilities are operated or
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
the way they're they're they're designed
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
and so you know we we believe we're
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
pretty good Regulators we do a good job
 
01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
regulating these facilities but we do
 
01:00:09.069 --> 01:00:09.079 align:start position:0%
not design construct and operate
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
landfills the regulated Community does
 
01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:13.960 align:start position:0%
and so their input is important to us we
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
need to hear from them the same way we
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
hear from other members of the community
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
and the public and we've met with groups
 
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
of of all stripes with regard to these
 
01:00:26.109 --> 01:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
rules um but we we do have a respons
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
ability to listen to what their concerns
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
are and evaluate them objectively and
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
understand whether in some cases we may
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
have it wrong or we or we need to amend
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
what we're looking to propose so there
 
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
are examples of where they have raised
 
01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
concerns to us um we've we have uh you
 
01:00:44.589 --> 01:00:44.599 align:start position:0%
know the waste management Council has
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
raised concerns to
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
us that that were informed by input from
 
01:00:51.789 --> 01:00:51.799 align:start position:0%
the regulated community and we've looked
 
01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
at those objectively and very carefully
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
and we've worked to really make make
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
sure that if we propose a change there
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
is a basis for it that it makes sense
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
there's a reason to do it that is um
 
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
that that serves the public at large and
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
serves Public Safety and Environmental
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
Protection um and that so they're all I
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
can say is they are they have a place at
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
the table of the public of of the
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
broader public for us to just ignore
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
what they have to say because they're
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
the regulated Community I think would
 
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
cause us to make a lot of errors and we
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be willing to do that one quick
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
follow um let um let's get to
 
01:01:33.309 --> 01:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
representative Murray got three
 
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
minutes um go ahead um thank you um
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Shar and thank you to the
 
01:01:41.069 --> 01:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
department I I want to thank you for the
 
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
inclusion and reference to um Solid
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
Waste uh EnV
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
105.9 which was with respect to um the
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
notice of
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
um incident reporting mhm um and with
 
01:01:59.870 --> 01:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
that I I did take a chance to go back
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
and take a look at I know that we are
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
not sort of rewriting those but I I
 
01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
would hope that the department would
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to have a
 
01:02:11.549 --> 01:02:11.559 align:start position:0%
conversation with me about how those um
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
1,000 rules currently read sure um I had
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
taken a look at I I think there was a
 
01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
conversation in the language there that
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
says as soon as practicable um I do
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
share some concerns with that language
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
and feel that it is a little bit of a
 
01:02:29.789 --> 01:02:29.799 align:start position:0%
squishy sort of um open to
 
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
interpretation as to what that means and
 
01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:34.039 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it would be an
 
01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate opportunity to have that
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
conversation today or um I do have
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
thoughts so I'm whatever sure you worked
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
on that do you want to speak I'm gonna
 
01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
ask Leah to speak to that sure good
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
morning everyone again leam McKenna uh
 
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
Bureau administrator of theway
 
01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
management Bureau uh we did just um
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
reopt that set of rules en vsw 1,000 I
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
will tell you with certainty we plan to
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
open that set of rules back up again in
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
the very near future I would love to
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
hear hear from you on thoughts to uh
 
01:03:10.269 --> 01:03:10.279 align:start position:0%
strengthen 1509 we have some thoughts at
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
the department as well wmbr rules de.
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
nh.gov send us an email and we will
 
01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
certainly engage on that top absolutely
 
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
I think that there are some things just
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
given the modern sort of where we are
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
electronically um the ability to
 
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
communicate with folks I have a lot of
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
thoughts about how those rules are
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
written and I would love to continue
 
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
that dialogue and strengthen them
 
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
because I do feel like there are some
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
areas there that are open to
 
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
interpretation that I am not comfortable
 
01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
with very happy to talk to you about
 
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
that thank you and representative H
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
Haskins yes um thank you
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
and so I appreciate the challenge that
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
is before you I don't know if 10 years
 
01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
ago when the rules were updated there
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
was a permit application sitting on your
 
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
desk um but that's the situation we have
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
now which complicates things I think the
 
01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
public that we represent wants to know
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
not only will they be heard but what
 
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
they have to say in terms of concern
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
will be every bit as important and
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
will'll find its way into the updated
 
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
rules as Miss robinet said We Know
 
01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.390 align:start position:0%
rules as Miss robinet said We Know
Better

01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
Better
 
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
and Maya Angelou's statement was when we
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
know better we do better and that's what
 
01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:35.240 align:start position:0%
we're looking for thank
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
you okay so thank you so much um I don't
 
01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:47.069 --> 01:04:47.079 align:start position:0%
just okay in one and a half seconds so
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
yeah um so there was a lot of
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
information that um you weren't able to
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
get to and uh I know that representative
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
ger had um some questions so could you
 
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
please follow up with um with us in
 
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
answering some of those questions in
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
writing um that were sent to you before
 
01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
this meeting um yeah so I think are are
 
01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
you speaking to the original set of
 
01:05:14.589 --> 01:05:14.599 align:start position:0%
rules that still had outstanding or
 
01:05:16.269 --> 01:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
excuse me questions that we still had
 
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
outstanding questions on that were
 
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
around some of the um continued changes
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
with regard to the I'm talking about
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
after the ma March 6th meeting um
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
representative ger asked for five
 
01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
examples things like yeah I don't I
 
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
don't have it we don't have any of that
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
and you guys asked okay so I didn't put
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
any more questions forward but I didn't
 
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
I haven't received anything bear with me
 
01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.190 align:start position:0%
I haven't received anything bear with me
one

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:05:45.549 --> 01:05:45.559 align:start position:0%
second let me see those questions and
 
01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
then we'll forward them officially no
 
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
they were already forwarded oh so it's
 
01:05:52.029 --> 01:05:52.039 align:start position:0%
these questions
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
here that would these are the ones these
 
01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
are the only things we forwarded to
 
01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
them from the last meeting which I
 
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
didn't give you any questions there was
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
another set of questions that were
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
forwarded okay so I never got another
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
set of questions I'm glad to forward
 
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
them but if I don't get them I can't
 
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:10.950 align:start position:0%
them but if I don't get them I can't
forward

01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
them let me check with him then that's
 
01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
what I I thought there was something
 
01:06:18.029 --> 01:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
sent over unless they received a certain
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
we'll sort it out okay um I would like
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
like to have another committee meeting
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
we talked about the 3rd of May going to
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
the Waste Management Facility so
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
potentially the Tuesday after that is
 
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
that is that okay with everyone at same
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
time nine
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
7th or the I I cannot do the seventh the
 
01:06:59.269 --> 01:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
sixth six or 8th is fine of
 
01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
May sth would be preferable let's just
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
keep it on Tuesdays because we normally
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
meet I understand that but does that not
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.599 --> 01:07:14.230 align:start position:0%
 
day

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
uh let me check and see if I can move
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
that but want to go to the or we could
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
do the 14th 14th is
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
open okay any any obviously with the
 
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
agency will will endeavor to make itself
 
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
available to the subcommittee I would
 
01:07:33.069 --> 01:07:33.079 align:start position:0%
note at this point we're we're entering
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
the formal Ru making process yeah the
 
01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:36.799 align:start position:0%
very first official thing that's going
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
to happen from a public I mean it's all
 
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
public the rulemaking notice will be
 
01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
published and that will be essentially
 
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
what we presented to the council at this
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
past at the last meeting um and then the
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
really the next milestone in the process
 
01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
is the public hearing and comment period
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
we will not have rev rules to present to
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be appropriate for us to
 
01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
have a rulemaking notice out there and
 
01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:02.839 align:start position:0%
then talk about proposed changes to that
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
rul making to that that date I'm sorry
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
you just went through it but sure yeah I
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
didn't give you a date for the hearing
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
do do you have a sense when it's likely
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
to be so so things get a little get a
 
01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
little mushy now because things kind of
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of different folks get involved
 
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
we anticipate having a public Hearing in
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
the month of May and the public comment
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
period would extend for some we should
 
01:08:26.110 --> 01:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
have if we're going to have one last
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
meeting before that needs to be before
 
01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.950 align:start position:0%
meeting before that needs to be before
that

01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
date well I I guess what I'm wondering
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
is what what do we talk about at that
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
meeting because um we're going to again
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to file a rulemaking notice
 
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to have that initial
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
proposal and we're not going to be
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
making I mean we're not going to stop
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
thinking about it but we're not going to
 
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
be making any public recommendations for
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
changes right until and I mean the the
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
next for us in this rule making process
 
01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
the next really important period where
 
01:08:58.269 --> 01:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to be looking at public
 
01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
comment and and making considerations of
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
change making changes from this initial
 
01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
proposal to the final proposal is after
 
01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
we get that oral comment and that
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
written comment and we have a chance to
 
01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
review it so I I just don't want to
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
disappoint you if I don't want to come
 
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
and say well I got nothing to say
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
sub um Mr chair and uh for a moment if I
 
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
can just um nothing precludes us from
 
01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
also providing testimony during that
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
public comment period so we could
 
01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps draft some of our thoughts as
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee and submit those during
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
that time I believe that that would be
 
01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
an appropriate Avenue for the
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yeah we would very much
 
01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
encourage that and represent
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
poens so basically we've had all of
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
these meetings right we've expressed a
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of concerns and questions
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
and all of that and at this point none
 
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
of those have been applied the any
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
everything that's happened is weaker
 
01:09:56.910 --> 01:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
weaker and weaker and unfortunately um
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
the waste management council is pretty
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
much 90% industry and that's who you
 
01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
guys are hearing from in making those
 
01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.310 align:start position:0%
guys are hearing from in making those
determinations

01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
determinations
 
01:10:08.189 --> 01:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
so I just I I guess I don't understand
 
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
because nothing even if we have another
 
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
meeting it's not like you guys are going
 
01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
to take all of these things that we've
 
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
brought up and and the experts that
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
we've had in here and and and go back
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
correct you're not going to be going
 
01:10:25.709 --> 01:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
back you've gone weaker three times so
 
01:10:26.910 --> 01:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
are you're not going to be doing
 
01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
anything different so are we going to
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
expect anything
 
01:10:32.669 --> 01:10:32.679 align:start position:0%
different well I I guess just to respond
 
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
to your first comment um I believe that
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
that these rules are far superior to the
 
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
existing set of rules that we have they
 
01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
are more protective in many respects and
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
I also believe that our decisions about
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
what this current initial proposal looks
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
like have absolutely been influenced by
 
01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
everyone that we've spoken with and very
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
much so including this subcommittee now
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
there may be disappointments for
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
individual members of the subcommittee
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
on specific areas that you wish that the
 
01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
agency had drafted a different way and I
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
understand that and I respect that but I
 
01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
will tell you that we've been listening
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
to you all along and everything all the
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
decisions we've made about the content
 
01:11:17.229 --> 01:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
of this initial proposal have been
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
informed by your input okay so what what
 
01:11:25.709 --> 01:11:25.719 align:start position:0%
I would like to do and that's a to to
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative penza's
 
01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.950 align:start position:0%
representative penza's
Point

01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
Point
 
01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
um if
 
01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:36.350 align:start position:0%
um if
on

01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:11:38.629 --> 01:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh I would like to hold another sub
 
01:11:38.639 --> 01:11:39.510 align:start position:0%
uh I would like to hold another sub
commmittee

01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
commmittee
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
meeting uh I will forward you questions
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:11:45.199 --> 01:11:46.750 align:start position:0%
that representative
jamana

01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
jamana
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
has I I will verify that he has those
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
questions to get them to you but more
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
specifically I would like to hear
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
exactly how these are more stringent
 
01:11:58.159 --> 01:11:59.270 align:start position:0%
exactly how these are more stringent
than

01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
previous so where our input is and and
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
that's and to represent hins point so if
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
you could just describe to us how our
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
input in this discussion has improved
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
the ru making process in terms of
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
protection and how these rules
 
01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
today that that you have written are
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
more because there are members in the
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
committee that don't see it and so
 
01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
clearly we should be a mouthpiece for
 
01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:33.709 align:start position:0%
clearly we should be a mouthpiece for
the

01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
state saying they we're doing a good job
 
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
we are being more protective but if we
 
01:12:41.709 --> 01:12:41.719 align:start position:0%
in this committee after many hours of
 
01:12:45.149 --> 01:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
discussion don't see that then that is
 
01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
that's concerning to
 
01:12:49.229 --> 01:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
me thank you for those comments
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
represent Kon I want to note that you
 
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
know um a lot of this has to do with
 
01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
what has happened in time right so we um
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
we've been thinking about these rules
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
for a really long time our you know
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
Engineers have been going along doing
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
their work um processing permit
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
applications regulating facilities doing
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
inspections dealing with facilities when
 
01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
things go wrong and so they're always
 
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
thinking you know Ru making for us is a
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
is a is a full-time job all the time if
 
01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
we're not writing rules we're thinking
 
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
about how they need to be amended and um
 
01:13:22.629 --> 01:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
so the rules package that came out in
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
the fall was informed by by um uh a
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
whole bunch by that all that all that
 
01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
sort of institutional knowledge of our
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
staff and and what we've been
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
experiencing it was informed by um a a
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
robust public participation process that
 
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
started last March and went through to
 
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
this fall um and so there were areas
 
01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
that were um you know significantly
 
01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
changed that that would you know
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
arguably would be very protective um
 
01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
that were influenced by of that so then
 
01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
we got there but then when you know when
 
01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
folks started looking at them more
 
01:14:01.629 --> 01:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
critically and the rules started to kind
 
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
of take shape and really gel then we did
 
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
receive a lot of concerns about the
 
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
Practical ability to implement those
 
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
rules so it is certainly true that there
 
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
are some areas that could be perceived
 
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
as having been really protective in the
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
original draft that have been changed um
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
in in in in response to concerns about
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
the actual implementability of them or
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
the or the potential ad impacts of
 
01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
trying to implement those so it's going
 
01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
to be the CA and this is what happens
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
with any rul making um it's going to be
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
the case that in
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
those months leading up to finally
 
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
filing an initial proposal you're likely
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
to see some things that that may soften
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
some very difficult or or um uh rigorous
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
requirements that doesn't mean that and
 
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
when I say that we've been informed by
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
that we we may be looking at comments
 
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
you know the one member of Industry may
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
say well we don't think that rule should
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
apply at all and someone at this table
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
may say well we think not only should it
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
apply it should be even more stringent
 
01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
and we land somewhere where we think we
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
balanced the legitimate concerns of a
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
party who doesn't like the rule at all
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
and the legitimate concerns of this
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
group are others who want it to be as
 
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
protective as possible and we land
 
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere so when I say it's been
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
influenced that's the kind of primary
 
01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
influence I'm talking about I completely
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
understand I I got you I'm all over it
 
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
you guys do this every day we do this
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
once a month and and you guys have been
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
doing it your whole lives and and we
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
have it I completely respect
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
that what I would like to
 
01:15:40.199 --> 01:15:41.709 align:start position:0%
that what I would like to
see

01:15:41.709 --> 01:15:41.719 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:15:43.709 --> 01:15:43.719 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
description of the rules 10 years
 
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
ago versus the 21 March
 
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
rules and how the 21 March rules
 
01:15:57.950 --> 01:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
protect the environment
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
better than the rules of 10 years
 
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
ago and it doesn't have to be at nauseum
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's top 10 top five something that
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
something we can look at and we can say
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
yes this process is in fact protecting
 
01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:13.830 align:start position:0%
yes this process is in fact protecting
our

01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
environment and balancing I I completely
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
understand the the the requirement for
 
01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
balance and I understand that if you say
 
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
it's got to be a sheet of metal
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
underneath there that nothing can ever
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
get through that's stainless steel it'll
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
never happen so it's something between
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
stainless steel and sand but what we owe
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
to our
 
01:16:36.669 --> 01:16:36.679 align:start position:0%
constituents is the ability to go back
 
01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
and say yes this process is protecting
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
our environment it is helping to
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
prevent those activities that happened
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
in the past and that the rules that
 
01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
we've created through this process are
 
01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.590 align:start position:0%
we've created through this process are
in

01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
fact protecting the public
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
from these these dangers and and
 
01:17:01.709 --> 01:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
improving on a system that you know that
 
01:17:05.229 --> 01:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
that needs to be improved sure so that
 
01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm asking I think we can
 
01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
prepare for you a summary that looks
 
01:17:11.149 --> 01:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
like that you know a top 10 or whatever
 
01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know how many it'll be but
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
basically yeah I don't need every te and
 
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
every dot crossed what I need to know I
 
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
got to have something I can go back to
 
01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
my constituent and say
 
01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
hey these guys are doing a great job
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
they've made some comp ises here here
 
01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
and here but at the end of the day it's
 
01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
much more protective than what we had
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
before we can certainly highlight the
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
key Provisions that have added
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
protections and we're happy to do that
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay all right good we're 15 minutes
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
over so I'm going to
 
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
adjourn um but thank you so much
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
