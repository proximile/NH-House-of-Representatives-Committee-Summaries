00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
we will be coming out of break in just a
 
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.030 align:start position:0%
we will be coming out of break in just a
moment

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
right now we are gathering people who
 
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
is this working okay we're coming out a
 
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
break this wasn't a recess
 
00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 align:start position:0%
it was a break so
 
00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative edwards is up on his part
 
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
of the discussion
 
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
on the health and human services budget
 
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair i
 
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
i i think we just followed the 1940s
 
00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
movie paradigm of the cliffhanger
 
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh when we last left our intrepid hero
 
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh senator daniels uh uh i was curious
 
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
um about these uh mobile crisis response
 
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
teams i'm
 
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at line 63 in between line
 
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
63 and 64 on the system of care
 
00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
over the biennium the senate added
 
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
approximately 5.3 million 5.4 million
 
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
and the mobile crisis response team is
 
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
is mentioned as part of the
 
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
justification in the footnote
 
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh i'm just i'm just curious
 
00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
if the senate received
 
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
good information about the status
 
00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
of the state's efforts to stand up these
 
00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
mobile response teams because
 
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
it seems like whenever there's a need
 
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
for money
 
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
the somebody uses the magic words mobile
 
00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 align:start position:0%
response team and money is provided so i
 
00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
was just curious
 
00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
senator thank you uh i believe that the
 
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
the department uh
 
00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 align:start position:0%
you know has been seeking these for a
 
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
while and sometimes they've been funded
 
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.229 align:start position:0%
while and sometimes they've been funded
sometimes

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 align:start position:0%
they haven't we looked at it as is part
 
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
of our plan
 
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
for starting to address what the root
 
00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 align:start position:0%
cause of things are
 
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
we we understand that areas like mental
 
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
health are growing at such a rate
 
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
and we're pouring more and more money
 
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
into it and we've told the department
 
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's not sustainable
 
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
we need to go back we need to find ways
 
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
that we can treat people before they get
 
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
into the system before they get into the
 
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.509 align:start position:0%
into the system before they get into the
hospitals

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis units were part of that
 
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
plan so that's why we put it in there
 
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
the expectation is this will be part of
 
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
what we're monitoring
 
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and it would be uh it wouldn't be
 
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
logical for us not to monitor
 
00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know if we're going to put that much
 
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
money into trying to prevent
 
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh a system from from continuing to grow
 
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that it's working
 
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
if it's not working
 
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
then we will change to something else in
 
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
the future thank you senator i think i
 
00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
think we agree on
 
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
on the identifying the problem and
 
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
hoping that this is as part of the
 
00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
so i would like to move on to
 
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.030 align:start position:0%
so i would like to move on to
[Music]

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
line one zero eight one zero eight
 
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
is surrounded by a bunch of lines where
 
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.070 align:start position:0%
is surrounded by a bunch of lines where
there's

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
been some accounting changes without
 
00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 align:start position:0%
real policy changes
 
00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
and on 108 we see 1.6 million dollars a
 
00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:43.910 align:start position:0%
and on 108 we see 1.6 million dollars a
year

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
being taken out of the state's budget
 
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
this is money that
 
00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 align:start position:0%
was was going directly to
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood of northern new
 
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
england and
 
00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
and i think maybe some other abortion
 
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.550 align:start position:0%
and i think maybe some other abortion
providers

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
this is coming out of the budget that
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
3.2 million dollars
 
00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
we won't see any more but that's still
 
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
money as i understand it that is
 
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
still going to uh planned parenthood is
 
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
that your understanding sir
 
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
if i recall correctly and uh that uh
 
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
this money was removed because of the
 
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
expectation that federal funds
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
would basically supplant them ah so so
 
00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
it is going to be federal money going
 
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll defer to lba
 
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
sure yup sure so
 
00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 align:start position:0%
this 1.6 million was budgeted in error
 
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
these are federal funds that aren't
 
00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 align:start position:0%
available at the moment because of
 
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
changes to title 10 funding a couple of
 
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
years ago but there's an expectation
 
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
that they will become available
 
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
shortly but even if they are made
 
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
available they wouldn't go through the
 
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
state they would go directly to family
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
planning centers and so
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's no need to budget them and they
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been budgeted originally
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
so the department requested that they
 
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
become out that they come out
 
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
so that's what you see here all right
 
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
um while we're on that line item um
 
00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
uh the house and the senate
 
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 align:start position:0%
have agreed that an fy22
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
will put 812 000
 
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
into the family planning program and
 
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's not reflected in any paper that
 
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 align:start position:0%
and that was right what the governor had
 
00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:32.870 align:start position:0%
and that was right what the governor had
recommended

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
in addition to that what the house did
 
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
is we put another supplemental 50
 
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 align:start position:0%
000 on that general funds line
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
in order to incentivize additional
 
00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
competition for these family planning
 
00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:48.629 align:start position:0%
competition for these family planning
contracts

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
and as as i understand the senate's uh
 
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.469 align:start position:0%
and as as i understand the senate's uh
proposal

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
in the section 34 that we had done where
 
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.749 align:start position:0%
in the section 34 that we had done where
we

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:55.759 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
were intentionally trying to incentivize
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
new vendors that i as i understand the
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
senate version
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't have that and now hb2
 
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
needs hb1
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
well in their hp 2 but it affects hp1
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
so so so in anticipation of that
 
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.629 align:start position:0%
so so so in anticipation of that
conversation

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
what i what i'd like to do is go ahead
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
and from
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
hb1 take the 50 000
 
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
supplemental money and just pull it out
 
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
of hb1
 
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
because that would be redundant money or
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessary money
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
if we were to seed to the senate's
 
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.990 align:start position:0%
if we were to seed to the senate's
version

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
version
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
of hb2 so so i would like to
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
i would if there's any discussion on
 
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.510 align:start position:0%
i would if there's any discussion on
this

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
we can discuss it but i would like to
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
move that
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
in hb 1
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
we remove the 50 000 supplement
 
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
that was added to the state's family
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
program money
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh in order to clean up hb1
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
and get it ready for an hb2 discussion
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
next week
 
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
what accounting union is that
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're referring to uh row 108
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
so you can reference it there there's a
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
family program that's federal money
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
the line we're talking about is federal
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
money but the program is there
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
uh mr ripple can tell you the program
 
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
number sure so the accounting unit is
 
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.990 align:start position:0%
number sure so the accounting unit is
5530

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
5530
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
and in your compare report it's online
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
on pages 12 24 and 12
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
25. so what representative edwards is
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
referring to was 50 000
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
that the house added uh that the senate
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
kept along with the corresponding
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
footnotes saying that 50 000 shall be
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
used for the purpose of providing
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
incentive funds to first-time contract
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
awardees so i think what you're
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
suggesting representative edwards is
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
that both the fifty thousand dollars and
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
the footnote would come out of house
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
bill one
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
um yes mr ripple that's exactly what i'm
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
the motion i'm attempting to move here
 
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.350 align:start position:0%
the motion i'm attempting to move here
okay

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
representative okay if i'm understanding
 
00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.189 align:start position:0%
representative okay if i'm understanding
correctly

00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't show up here because it's
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
the same for both the house and the
 
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.830 align:start position:0%
the same for both the house and the
senate

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
what's being asked is that we
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
find whatever line item that is
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
and reduce it by the 50 000.
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
along with the footnote yeah yeah okay
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
55.30 so that's that's the motion that
 
00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:37.750 align:start position:0%
55.30 so that's that's the motion that
we

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
if we well
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's account 5530 which is on pages 12
 
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
24 and 12 25 in your compare report
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay if you want to look it up
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
representative over
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
mr perhaps mr ripple can respond to this
 
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
and i see that
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
both the house and the senate have
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
neither one of them seems to refer to
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
the use of any general funds so are we
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
talking entirely
 
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
federal funds and have we received those
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
this 50 000 is a general fund
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
and so if you go to the previous page uh
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
that shows you the class lines for 55.30
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
you'll see on line 103 uh
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
that 50 000 that the senate left in
 
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
that was the 50 000 that the house added
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
so when we take this out the agreement
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
is to put it into hb2
 
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
if if we add it back it'll be in hb2 and
 
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
that's for
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
monday's discussion or tuesdays does
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
everybody understand the motion to
 
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.430 align:start position:0%
everybody understand the motion to
remove

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
remove
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
from hb1 do we actually have an
 
00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:16.389 align:start position:0%
from hb1 do we actually have an
amendment

00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
you don't have a formal amendment but i
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
think you could direct us to make that
 
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.150 align:start position:0%
think you could direct us to make that
change

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
okay thoughts from the senate
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
senate so just for our understanding
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
your intention is to still provide this
 
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.630 align:start position:0%
your intention is to still provide this
funding

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
i would like to uh have the
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
senate agree with my position on monday
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
or tuesday relative to
 
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:0%
enforcing the financial and physical
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
separation of family planning from
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
the reproductive health facilities but
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
on the thought that the senate may not
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
support that
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
we won't need this 50 000 in that
 
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.509 align:start position:0%
we won't need this 50 000 in that
scenario

00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
because this 50 000 is entirely intended
 
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
to incentivize new vendors to replace
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
the reproductive health facilities that
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
already have
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
the contracts so this was this fifty
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
thousand is incentive money
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
for new vendors and if we were to agree
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
with the senate
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
next week this 50 000
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
would would not be needed and so
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
therefore i'm just trying to clean up
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
the books
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
while we're while we're on hb1 and get
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
okay mr chair a question for the lba
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
do we need to make that change in hb1 or
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
could there be an hb2 amendment that
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
depending on what the committee of
 
00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
conference on hb2 decides
 
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
directs the spending yeah it's up to the
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
committee you can address it here
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
and reduce that class line or you could
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
reduce it in an amendment to house bill
 
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:06.629 align:start position:0%
reduce it in an amendment to house bill
2

00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
2
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
reducing this class line by 50 000 so
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
it's up to the community
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
both would be appropriate and
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
i'm addressing it now because i'm at the
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
table now monday i'm an alternate so
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure where i'll be on monday
 
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
well if you left it here the way it is
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
then the money would be there to
 
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.430 align:start position:0%
then the money would be there to
incentivize

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
incentivize
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know what will happen on monday
 
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
tuesday and wednesday
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
so if i'm reading the chairman right i
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
should withdraw this motion
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
yes mr mr chairman i withdraw this
 
00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:41.190 align:start position:0%
yes mr mr chairman i withdraw this
motion

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
thank you okay and so with that
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
i think i am prepared to say that
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
um on the senate versus house uh
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
form that we've been using i i move that
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
we accede
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
to the senate's position from lines 49
 
00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:04.839 align:start position:0%
all the way through the end of it on
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
146. second
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
okay motion in a second for the house
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
members to exceed
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
on those aforementioned line numbers 48
 
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.069 align:start position:0%
on those aforementioned line numbers 48
through

00:13:15.069 --> 00:13:15.079 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:13:15.079 --> 00:13:18.949 align:start position:0%
through
146.

00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
any further discussion senator rosenwald
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
reluctantly not that reluctantly
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to be able to support this
 
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.710 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to be able to support this
motion

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
not only because i think the additional
 
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:33.990 align:start position:0%
not only because i think the additional
1.2

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
1.2
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars is needed for the title
 
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:37.910 align:start position:0%
million dollars is needed for the title
10

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh program um they're all over the state
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood is one of them but so
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
is coast family
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
coast health center so is
 
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
amiskeg health and there are there are a
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
number of them
 
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
but i'm also concerned about the three
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
million dollar decrease
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
in the state loan repayment program i
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
know the senate
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
added money from the house position
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
but we have a really
 
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
critical shortage of health care
 
00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.110 align:start position:0%
critical shortage of health care
workforce

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm concerned about that too
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
so senator what line do you refer to i'm
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
looking at line
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
51 and i have to say that senator
 
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.670 align:start position:0%
51 and i have to say that senator
hennessey

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
hennessey
 
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
worked this unbelievably but
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
we were not able to get back the entire
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
level funding of the current biennium
 
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
while the problem continues to be
 
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:41.030 align:start position:0%
while the problem continues to be
exacerbated

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you further discussion
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey thank you um outside
 
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
of the budget process
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
i am hopeful that the monies that are
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
coming into state from the
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
the federal monies coming into the state
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
will address
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
the the needs of a lot of our health
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
care providers
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
that have that we have seen um
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
drastically increase because of the
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
covet pandemic and i'm hopeful that
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
those funds will be used for
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
the student loan repayment program or
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
slurp which we
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
love to refer to it as and that we will
 
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.310 align:start position:0%
love to refer to it as and that we will
see

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
a significant increase in funding for
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
our health care professionals and their
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
student loan repayment
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and follow up follow up and as
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
far as the federal funds go i
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
i am upset that the federal government
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
has not decided to
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
provide the funding to our uh family
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
planning services that they
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
they should have increased by now and
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
and and are very able to increase
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
um and and the supplant
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
by supplanting these funds with general
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
funds it's it's calling on states to do
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
something that i don't think we
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
we should have to do so i would i would
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
recommend reaching out to your federal
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
delegation to
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
tell them to do their job on this and
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
and get these fundings to
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
our our needed services especially the
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
ones that
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
um that we can agree on definitely need
 
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:05.509 align:start position:0%
um that we can agree on definitely need
these

00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
this funding senator rosenwald
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you i believe that the uh
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
current federal administration is
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
working to get that money out
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
directly to the states but it will take
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
probably until next winter or spring
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
before the providers who have been
 
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
ineligible to participate in
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
title 10 are able to re-qualify
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
again so i think in the meantime
 
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
we're reducing
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
access to important health care for
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
further discussion seeing none the
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
motion is for the house to exceed
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
to the senate position on the
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
stated correctly no see no further
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
discussion house members all in favor of
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
hands down senate members in favor of
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
it's two to one motion passes
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
the next thing we have is i guess
 
00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:26.949 align:start position:0%
the next thing we have is i guess
education

00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
and that will go to representative
 
00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.070 align:start position:0%
and that will go to representative
umberger

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
umberger
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman i uh would move to a
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
seed to the
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
senate position second okay
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
house moves to exceed to the senate
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
position on the department of education
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
changes further discussion
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
i certainly have no problem with these
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
all right i guess i should say in hb1
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald thank you um i'm
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
the level of k-12 education going out to
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
our cities and towns so i will not be
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
in the regular budget and not in here is
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
you said you were concerned about the
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
amount of money that was going
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
out to our cities and towns for adequate
 
00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.789 align:start position:0%

00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
but it's not anything to do with what's
 
00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:48.310 align:start position:0%
but it's not anything to do with what's
here

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%

take care of these no changes okay
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%

first motion
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
if there's no changes it's considered
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
done and i believe lba has made that
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay so um when we see the index
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%

um that was in division one
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
department of energy as they looked at
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
the positions i'm pretty sure
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
they were still and i know the
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
governor's budget directorate told us
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
that they were still working out the
 
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.870 align:start position:0%
that they were still working out the
positions

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
obviously a change when they got to the
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
senate which i talked to the governor's
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
budget director about
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
before he left for his wedding and he
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
thought it was an
 
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.559 align:start position:0%
improvement we have approved and acceded
 
00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:39.270 align:start position:0%
improvement we have approved and acceded
to

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
the liquor so i would move to exceed to
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
the senate in this section
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
motion in a second to exceed to the
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
senate any further discussion
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none house members in favor raise
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
senate members in favor raise your hand
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
and the motion passes so moving on that
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
same page uh down to
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
no footnote number nine department of
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
information technology
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
again mr chairman this gets back to the
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
fact that we knew the senate was going
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
to have more money we knew
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
doit had had significant cuts in the
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
governor's budget we were hoping that
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
they would be able to restore them and
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
they worked on that so we will accede to
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
the senate position
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
motion and a second to exceed to the
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
senate position
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'm doing that for foot note
 
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
9 and footnote 10 as they are the same
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
very same agency okay
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
that applies the motion applies to foot
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
note 9 and 10.
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
does everybody understand that all right
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
further discussion seeing none house
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
members in favor of exceeding raise your
 
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.149 align:start position:0%
members in favor of exceeding raise your
hand

00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
senate members in favor
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
the motion is adopted moving on to this
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
page five so if i turn the page i would
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
have included
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
footnote 11 in that and now i've turned
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
the page i would move footnote 11 for
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
the same reason this is again
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
doit thank you
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
okay now we're moving on to a new
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
right and i just moved it yep and it's
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
been motion and
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
i believe i got a second further
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
house members in favor of exceeding
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
senate members in favor the motion is
 
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.430 align:start position:0%
senate members in favor the motion is
adopted

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
okay now we're moving on because of that
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
all right footnote 12.
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
well we changed the way we reduced the
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
budget we did the back of the budget cut
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
and the senate did position cuts
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
it amounted to about the same amount of
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
well i actually know it spread over
 
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.110 align:start position:0%
well i actually know it spread over
about

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
maybe a dozen different thing things
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh that we basically put names to the
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
back of the budget cuts so we
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
identified the way that was come out and
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
it came out to just under 60 million
 
00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.269 align:start position:0%
it came out to just under 60 million
dollars

00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay rather than having the back of the
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
budget cut so
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
um what foot does that eliminate a
 
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.470 align:start position:0%
um what foot does that eliminate a
footnote

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
footnote
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
the footnote has been eliminated so on
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
page six
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
the senate has deleted section 12
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
which is the back of the budget
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
reduction so if the house is in
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
agreement they would see to the senate
 
00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
and there's footnote 13
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
that's new that's new all right so on
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
section 12 i would move to exceed to the
 
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:03.909 align:start position:0%
section 12 i would move to exceed to the
senate

00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
second okay foot note 12 move to exceed
 
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
to the senate any further discussion
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
seeing none house members in favor raise
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
your hands
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
senate members in favor raise your hand
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
motion is adopted
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
all right 13 has no
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
footnote 13 is a new one from the senate
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
5 rate increase to skilled nursing
 
00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:39.830 align:start position:0%
5 rate increase to skilled nursing
facilities

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair this was the guy to
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
con amendment that we had on the senate
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
floor the other day
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
and inadvertently there was a group of
 
00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.029 align:start position:0%
and inadvertently there was a group of
um

00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
facilities that were ex um inadvertently
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
excluded from the
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
five percent rate increase that we did
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
in the budget um
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
on the senate side so this this includes
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
those facilities that were
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%

in other words it's five percent and it
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
will go on forever
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay moving on to the
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates we can't argue with
 
00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
these because you've got latest figures
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
and they look a lot better than what we
 
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.110 align:start position:0%
and they look a lot better than what we
had

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%

00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%
that we exceed to these uh
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates uh i i move that we
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
accede to the
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%

that they have done uh what you gave us
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
was a was a budget that had a lot of
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
thought a lot of work put into it
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
and it certainly made it easier for us
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
to to complement the work that you had
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
done so we were able to build upon that
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
uh we obviously had
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
more accurate revenue numbers so we were
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
take the ideas that you were not able to
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
get in and fulfill
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
what i believe uh fulfills the needs of
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
the state

00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
bill to come before the bodies
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh this is our our requirement by
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
constitution that the
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%

and the senate bodies and get them to
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
