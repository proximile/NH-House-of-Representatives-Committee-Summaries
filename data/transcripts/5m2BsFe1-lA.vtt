uh good morning uh thank you chairman
 
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for the
 
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
record my name is Joshua query and I
 
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro district 16 which is
 
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester's Ward 9.
 
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to introduce House Bill
 
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
1414 which requires the state police to
 
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
submit an annual report on traffic
 
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.290 align:start position:0%
submit an annual report on traffic
violations

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 align:start position:0%
violations
 
00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
the bill aims to collect data including
 
00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 align:start position:0%
where the violations occurred type of
 
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
violation whether it was primary or
 
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
secondary offense
 
00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 align:start position:0%
if the citation was paid on time or at
 
00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:28.729 align:start position:0%
if the citation was paid on time or at
all

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
and where where applicable how many
 
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
warnings were issued
 
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
currently there is no place or way to
 
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
find out this information
 
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
the goal of this bill is to help inform
 
00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
future legislators in creating new
 
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
traffic laws and or help to inform
 
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
decisions when readdressing current
 
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
traffic and road safety concerns
 
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 align:start position:0%
furthermore for the last three years I
 
00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 align:start position:0%
have served on the public works and
 
00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 align:start position:0%
highways committee right across the hall
 
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
where we work closely with the
 
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
transportation and Department of Safety
 
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
where statistics like these can often
 
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
help us make educated decisions on where
 
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 align:start position:0%
to invest improvements to Granite State
 
00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
roadways having access to this data will
 
00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
allow us and future legislators the
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
ability to make informed decisions on
 
00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 align:start position:0%
how to assist our state troopers and
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
making the roadways of New Hampshire
 
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
much safer
 
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.810 align:start position:0%
much safer
uh

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be real brief so thank you
 
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
for your time and happy to take any and
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
all questions that you have
 
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes
 
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question you had mentioned
 
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.070 align:start position:0%
taking my question you had mentioned
that

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.170 align:start position:0%
that
this

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
that this report that the that the
 
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
police officer was supposed to gather
 
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not the penalty was paid and
 
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
if on time
 
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
is is there somebody in in an
 
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
administrative that that would do that
 
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
or is the police officer expected to
 
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 align:start position:0%
call around to these municipalities to
 
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
find out or to call the court to find
 
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
out this is actually paid
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
um when I talked with this uh State
 
00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 align:start position:0%
Police office earlier this year
 
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
um they informed me that they do have
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
this information for individual uh
 
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
violations so I don't expect it to be
 
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
the individual Troopers that would be
 
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
collecting this but it would be more of
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
an administrative office that would be
 
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
collecting this information
 
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.310 align:start position:0%
collecting this information
yep

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
wonders of
 
00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 align:start position:0%
how we'll improve our highways and our
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
byways and stuff like that
 
00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand how
 
00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
citations that are paid are not paid
 
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
how the gender or race of the person
 
00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 align:start position:0%
would affect that can you explain how
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
how you would use that to decide where
 
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
to pave or where to where to put
 
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
yeah uh thank you for that question
 
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.870 align:start position:0%
yeah uh thank you for that question
um

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
those were additional things that uh
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
after working with co-sponsors and the
 
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
office of legislative services that we
 
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
felt would eventually might be requested
 
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
and so we included it early on that way
 
00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259 align:start position:0%
it didn't have to be amended in future
 
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
future years my goal is to get the types
 
00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
of of violations mainly speed or safety
 
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
violations so I can make those in
 
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 align:start position:0%
informed decisions like I was saying in
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
across the hall
 
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.150 align:start position:0%
across the hall
follow

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
can you take
 
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
can you take a
 
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
situation and explain to me
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
how a citation would be used in in our
 
00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
roadway design or whatever I mean I'm
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
trying to understand
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
you know maybe because there's too many
 
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
of them or whatever but could you could
 
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
you explain to me how you would intend
 
00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:10.259 align:start position:0%
to use these
 
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
yeah um so working with the Department
 
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
of Transportation different roadways do
 
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
have the ability to handle different
 
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.430 align:start position:0%
have the ability to handle different
speeds

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
speeds
 
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
and flow of traffic
 
00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
um so knowing that a lot of people are
 
00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:25.969 align:start position:0%
um so knowing that a lot of people are
speeding

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
speeding
 
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
um or that there are severe road safety
 
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
issues with them speeding will allow us
 
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
to plan better for our highways so that
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
if someone does speed in an area that
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
seeing um thank you for your testimony
 
00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:54.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.969 --> 00:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm not I believe it's a trooper
 
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and members of the
 
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.089 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and members of the
committee

00:08:14.089 --> 00:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
um for this opportunity to speak to you
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
this morning my name is Victor Muzzy I
 
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
am a lieutenant with the New Hampshire
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
State Police currently in charge of
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
record Information Services
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
which encompasses a few areas of the
 
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:27.020 align:start position:0%
State Police
 
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
and I'm also the project manager
 
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
consequently enough for our new records
 
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
management system that we just went live
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
with in June
 
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.969 align:start position:0%
with in June
and

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:39.889 --> 00:08:39.899 align:start position:0%
I guess the state police's position on
 
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
this this bill as proposed with the
 
00:08:44.449 --> 00:08:44.459 align:start position:0%
language contained therein while we
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
would support the idea of an annual
 
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
report I think the the way the language
 
00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:52.019 align:start position:0%
is written is what we would oppose
 
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
for the following reasons at the moment
 
00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
given our practice and our standards
 
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
relative to traffic citations
 
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
uh while we have the ability to collect
 
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
things like race
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh in particular that's not a
 
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
requirement at the moment it's not a
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
required field in our in our system nor
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
is it a required field for either the
 
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
court or the DMV to adequately
 
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.190 align:start position:0%
court or the DMV to adequately
um

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:22.820 align:start position:0%
process if you will the traffic citation
 
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
furthermore the race portion of the
 
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
language that's contained in the bill is
 
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
concerning because uh scheduling of that
 
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
through the DM
 
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
V or through the process of of receiving
 
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:38.180 align:start position:0%
a license
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
so that would be left to speculation I
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
suppose on the part of our Troopers when
 
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
it came to determining race if in fact
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
we were required to collect that
 
00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
information pursuant to the language and
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
the bill is passes that there would have
 
00:09:59.930 --> 00:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
to be an additional mandate if you will
 
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
to collect that information at the time
 
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
of credentialing
 
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
um so that it's consistent and accurate
 
00:10:08.449 --> 00:10:08.459 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're going to rely on guesses
 
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
or speculation or other information that
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
is not going to add to the reliability
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
of the statistics relative to that
 
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.530 align:start position:0%
of the statistics relative to that
particular

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:17.540 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
data point
 
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
at the moment we don't record uh primary
 
00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:26.519 align:start position:0%
or secondary offense other than by RSA
 
00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:29.459 align:start position:0%
but certainly we would have the ability
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
to do that given the con the uh the
 
00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
confines of the new records management
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
system certainly the street municipality
 
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
uh the age
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
the number of citations
 
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the number of warnings those
 
00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:44.459 align:start position:0%
are all things that we could we could
 
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
report out now and we do by way of our
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
annual report it doesn't break down
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
certainly the roadways that these
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
offenses have occurred on nor the
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
individual offenses but that's something
 
00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:56.660 align:start position:0%
that we could certainly add
 
00:10:59.090 --> 00:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
our issue with the number of citations
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
paid on time the number of citations
 
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
paid late and the number of citations
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
where payment was not collected is
 
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
that's not a function of the State
 
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
Police that's a function of the Division
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles I don't have any
 
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
first-hand knowledge on how they collect
 
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
that or how they track that I would
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
suspect that they do however that's
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's not a function of the State
 
00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:22.940 align:start position:0%
Police so that would be a problem for us
 
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is written in order to
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
report out on that as far as a state
 
00:11:29.329 --> 00:11:29.339 align:start position:0%
police responsibility so that's that's
 
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
of concern I think also
 
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.090 align:start position:0%
of concern I think also
um

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
I lost my train of thought
 
00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:38.269 align:start position:0%
I lost my train of thought
um

00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
so again while we're in support of the
 
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
idea of this information to assist with
 
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
making the roadways safer where these
 
00:11:47.569 --> 00:11:47.579 align:start position:0%
violations are occurring to help do our
 
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
DOT determine uh where there may be
 
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
problem areas I think some of the
 
00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
demographics as they're stated in the
 
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
language will be difficult and I don't
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
think that those demographics will
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily be accurate which I think is
 
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
a problem if that's in fact what we're
 
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
looking for and I believe it is
 
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
based upon credentialing drivers and how
 
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
we would capture that information
 
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any and all
 
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.889 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any and all
questions

00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:12.899 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony Trooper
 
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.310 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
about a month ago
 
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
three members of this committee took a
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
had a briefing over at the Department of
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles yes sir and we had a very
 
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
long discussion about race and the
 
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
difficulty of being able to
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
gather it on site but I I may have might
 
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
not understand stood something
 
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
but I always give I took away from that
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
meeting an impression that specifically
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
race because that's the one that is the
 
00:12:52.129 --> 00:12:52.139 align:start position:0%
is the guessing and all the whole thing
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
there currently is as I understand it
 
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
drop down menus
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
and they have selections and some of
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
them are other and they even had one for
 
00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:03.290 align:start position:0%
them are other and they even had one for
ethnicity

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
ethnicity
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
my question is it sounded to me as
 
00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:13.019 align:start position:0%
though you collect some data on race
 
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
and enter it somewhere for some reason
 
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
would the state police have an objection
 
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
to including whatever data you now
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
currently add to it and perhaps what
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
happens in the future
 
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
where it's as simple as it appears to be
 
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.810 align:start position:0%
where it's as simple as it appears to be
now

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
to including that data
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
in a report if this bill were to pass
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
that required some kind of report
 
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
I I don't think the state police would
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
be opposed and if I may elaborate a
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
um as you recall I I was at that at that
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
meeting with you folks and
 
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
um and I didn't speak to it at the
 
00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:49.019 align:start position:0%
moment only because we're talking
 
00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
traffic citations so what I will clarify
 
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
is that yes in the in the process uh and
 
00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
as as you folks probably are all fully
 
00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
aware on the on the face of any traffic
 
00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
ticket there is a box to cut to gather
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
race uh there is also that same box
 
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
within our electronic process to gather
 
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
that however it's not required the
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
options currently in that in the course
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
of of crafting a traffic ticket our
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
American Indian Asian black unknown or
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
white I would say that we do have a
 
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
percentage of Troopers that likely fill
 
00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:22.139 align:start position:0%
that out if they can make a reasonable
 
00:14:22.139 --> 00:14:25.009 align:start position:0%
that out if they can make a reasonable
determination

00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:25.019 align:start position:0%
determination
 
00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
however I'm sure there are just as many
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
if not more in there it's left blank so
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
as to not
 
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
gather information that may not be
 
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.210 align:start position:0%
gather information that may not be
accurate

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:35.220 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
00:14:38.569 --> 00:14:38.579 align:start position:0%
where we are required to gather race as
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
a part of a neighbors reporting which is
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
our higher
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
reporting Authority when it comes to
 
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:47.300 align:start position:0%
crime data and arrests
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
is just that when we arrest someone we
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
are required to gather their race
 
00:14:53.639 --> 00:14:54.889 align:start position:0%
are required to gather their race
that

00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
data point is gathered by way of asking
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
the person what their race and ethnicity
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
is so while the traffic ticket doesn't
 
00:15:05.889 --> 00:15:05.899 align:start position:0%
have the ability to capture ethnicity
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
it does have the ability to capture race
 
00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
however in the course of arresting
 
00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:14.540 align:start position:0%
someone in gathering that information
 
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the arrest we can and are
 
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
required to capture both race and
 
00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.189 align:start position:0%
required to capture both race and
ethnicity

00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
ethnicity
 
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense thank you for your
 
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.750 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense thank you for your
question

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.509 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
would that then be an additional burden
 
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
or could you with the systems you have
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
now could you
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
report that information in this
 
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
for traffic tickets
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
I would have to work with Defender to
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
craft a report
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
that would report out exactly as as
 
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
you've got here that doesn't exist at
 
00:15:51.769 --> 00:15:51.779 align:start position:0%
the moment that doesn't mean we can't do
 
00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
that I don't know what the associated
 
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
cost may be to generate that report on a
 
00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
regular recurring basis but what I can
 
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
say is we do capture or have the ability
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
to capture that information and I
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
suspect could produce a report should
 
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
passion and I understand that and I
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
my own thing I would not be looking for
 
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
you doing additional stuff that was was
 
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
like that because you just have the data
 
00:16:21.769 --> 00:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
and if you can report it out then you
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
could include it in something like that
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
if you found it correct and if I
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly we could
 
00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
potentially report out on whatever data
 
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
we've collected as long as what you're
 
00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
saying is it's not required
 
00:16:33.899 --> 00:16:35.569 align:start position:0%
saying is it's not required
then

00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
we will report out on whatever we have
 
00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
gathered I guess to answer that fully
 
00:16:44.689 --> 00:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
representative Platt yes you use the
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
terms race and ethnicity yes could you
 
00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:49.259 align:start position:0%
distinguish between the police so I
 
00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:51.530 align:start position:0%
distinguish between the police so I
understand

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:55.259 align:start position:0%
race as I understand it
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
um is more broadly defined where
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
ethnicity is more narrowly defined with
 
00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
respect to
 
00:17:02.279 --> 00:17:03.769 align:start position:0%
respect to
someone's

00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
someone's
 
00:17:03.779 --> 00:17:06.710 align:start position:0%
someone's
um

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
nationality or what you know origin I
 
00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:11.579 align:start position:0%
guess race is more Broad
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
ethnicity is more narrowly defined
 
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
um thank you I'm going to go ahead and
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
ask a question myself
 
00:17:22.439 --> 00:17:23.990 align:start position:0%
ask a question myself
um

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
to what you said originally would it not
 
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
be easier if the DMV just included this
 
00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:32.220 align:start position:0%
on the driver's license I mean your
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
answer to the question regarding race
 
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
and ethnicity seems to um
 
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that it's it's a guessing
 
00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.210 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that it's it's a guessing
game

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
game
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
it certainly would be easier I don't
 
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
know what the process would be or what
 
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
would be required of
 
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
what the DMV would require to credential
 
00:17:51.169 --> 00:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
that from our perspective it certainly
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
would be we certainly don't aren't set
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
out to offend people or assume things
 
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
it's a little uncomfortable frankly to
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
have to ask people especially on a
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
traffic stop that happens
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
thousands of times per day what their
 
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
race might be an arrest is a little
 
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:05.890 align:start position:0%
race might be an arrest is a little
different

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:05.900 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
so it certainly would be easier for us
 
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
if that were built into the process by
 
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
way of credentialing yes
 
00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
thank you represent representative
 
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.289 align:start position:0%
thank you represent representative
Rhodes

00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
Rhodes
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
taking my question we did have a similar
 
00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
bill that we heard
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
um in the
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
in the first half of our term that had a
 
00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:27.740 align:start position:0%
lot to do with this would you would you
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
say that when you have to guess a
 
00:18:35.169 --> 00:18:35.179 align:start position:0%
person's age gender race or
 
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
ethnicity would be
 
00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:39.299 align:start position:0%
considered under the definition of
 
00:18:39.299 --> 00:18:48.110 align:start position:0%
considered under the definition of
profiling

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
I suppose to an extent I don't know if
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
profiling to me has a negative
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
connotation I suppose so
 
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.930 align:start position:0%
connotation I suppose so
I

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:18:58.850 --> 00:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
I guess it probably could lead to that
 
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
and I think if nothing else it could be
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
offensive to somebody who then gets a
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
copy of my traffic ticket where I've
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
I've indicated on there something that
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
isn't accurate
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
um that's I guess personally my fear
 
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
with with that
 
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
a data point is that I've tried to make
 
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
an educated guess and and failed and I'm
 
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
you know I may be offensive to somebody
 
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
so I guess
 
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.630 align:start position:0%
so I guess
having

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
what is currently the an unofficial
 
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
process to gather that I would say could
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
be considered profiling
 
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.870 align:start position:0%
be considered profiling
um

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term when it comes
 
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
to our current process of gathering that
 
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.470 align:start position:0%
to our current process of gathering that
sure

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:55.919 --> 00:20:01.789 align:start position:0%
 
age

00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
I think the annual report that we
 
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
generate is not required and maybe I'm
 
00:20:09.289 --> 00:20:09.299 align:start position:0%
wrong I I don't know whether it is or it
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
isn't I think out of good practice we
 
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
generate both a calendar year report and
 
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
an annual report which contains
 
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.289 align:start position:0%
an annual report which contains
um

00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:18.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
data relative to how many traffic stops
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
we conducted how many warnings we issued
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
how many summonses we issued I think
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
this bill lends further depth to the
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
statistics as I understand it we don't
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
report out on individual rsas or
 
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
roadways to the extent that the bill is
 
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
is looking to do this would certainly be
 
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive and likely more
 
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.450 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive and likely more
valuable

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
I think as a matter of
 
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
um not common practice but when there is
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
a concern or an issue or some reason
 
00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:51.539 align:start position:0%
for us to take a look at statistics on a
 
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
given roadway we do that on a one-off
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
basis now if something pops up it is a
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
problem so while it may seem redundant I
 
00:21:03.529 --> 00:21:03.539 align:start position:0%
think the intent of the bill here is
 
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
really looking for more depth and
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
clarity as to
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know it wasn't that we issued a
 
00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand citations throughout
 
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
the state but where did we issue those
 
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
what road was it on was it a speed is
 
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
this road and I think to the to the
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh credit of of the sponsors you know I
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
if that's the if that's the the intent
 
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
of the bill I think it this
 
00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:25.940 align:start position:0%
annual report would lend more clarity
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
and help on that than what we currently
 
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:39.649 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:21:39.649 --> 00:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
got them
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:50.039 align:start position:0%
um so in regards to profiling
 
00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:51.299 align:start position:0%
um do you
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
normally when you're putting out like a
 
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
search warrant do you say like six five
 
00:21:59.450 --> 00:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
for a search warrant for a person yeah
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
not as a matter of general practice if
 
00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
we know the individual that we're
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
looking to search we're usually trying
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
to identify them by name date of birth
 
00:22:12.649 --> 00:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
driver's license number Social Security
 
00:22:12.659 --> 00:22:15.110 align:start position:0%
driver's license number Social Security
number

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
those data points don't typically come
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
into play on a search warrant okay
 
00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
um do you use that type of information
 
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
sometimes to look for somebody
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh yep okay yep all right a wanted
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
person or something yes
 
00:22:35.169 --> 00:22:35.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering questions
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
um so if I get back to what you said
 
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
earlier you do not collect
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
information on the number of citations
 
00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
paid citations uh not collected
 
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
is that true
 
00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
and are you also indicated you don't
 
00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
report the location of the citation no
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
no we we we don't report out on it we
 
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
gather that at the moment and and so as
 
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
far as the location of the citation yes
 
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
that is gathered that is captured in our
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
records management system it's not
 
00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
something that we currently report out
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
on but I I don't see why we couldn't at
 
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
some point should we be required to
 
00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
relative to payment of citations how
 
00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:24.539 align:start position:0%
many are paid late how many aren't paid
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
that's a function of the Division of
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles not the division of State
 
00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
Police I can't speak intelligently to
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
that I suspect they capture that they
 
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
must in fact because if you don't pay a
 
00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
traffic summons that typically goes into
 
00:23:39.409 --> 00:23:39.419 align:start position:0%
default and whatnot and gets sent to the
 
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
court so while the state police doesn't
 
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
do that I think the state of New
 
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by way of DMV probably does
 
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
in a matter of safety uh is there
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
another report that's issued as far as
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
accidents are happening and where and
 
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.250 align:start position:0%
accidents are happening and where and
location

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
location
 
00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.370 align:start position:0%
location
Etc

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:57.380 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
not necessarily that's public facing and
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
not for any good reason I think that
 
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
information is probably shared with New
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire highway safety Federal Highway
 
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
Safety and D.O.T
 
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.570 align:start position:0%
Safety and D.O.T
um

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
I don't know specifically what that
 
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
report may or may not look like but to
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
my knowledge we don't generally speaking
 
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
have any public display of that but
 
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
again I don't see why we couldn't do
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
that but I do know we share that with
 
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
our internal and external business
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
partners as a matter of safety and as a
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
matter of
 
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
requirement really with the federal
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
government to to report out on where
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
these things are occurring which I
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
suspect they take into account when it
 
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
comes to roadway design and speed limits
 
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
and as does the state DOT I suspect
 
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
taking the question sir how uh following
 
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
up on my colleague's question about uh
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
somebody's race being identified if
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
they're wanted or if there's a press
 
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
release out to the media how does the uh
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
do State Police identify someone's race
 
00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:06.539 align:start position:0%
in that circumstance if they've never
 
00:25:09.289 --> 00:25:09.299 align:start position:0%
had any interaction with them or had any
 
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
self-identification by the suspect I
 
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
think that race would likely be
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
identified typically very broadly
 
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
speaking and it would probably only
 
00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:19.460 align:start position:0%
Encompass the folks that are
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
extreme and I think sometimes that
 
00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
description can include a mix of wraith
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
race and ethnicity
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
um I think sometimes descriptions can be
 
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
black white Hispanic Hispanic is not a
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
race it's an ethnicity so I think those
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
types of things are what we would
 
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
typically either gather from people that
 
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
are reporting the event and describing
 
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
the individual that's missing or wanted
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
in that manner or
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
by other official means such as
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
photographs that we may have and things
 
00:25:57.049 --> 00:25:57.059 align:start position:0%
that the common person may be able to
 
00:26:00.529 --> 00:26:00.539 align:start position:0%
describe somebody given their appearance
 
00:26:02.049 --> 00:26:02.059 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense
 
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you and along those same lines
 
00:26:06.769 --> 00:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
could you use that same standard you
 
00:26:09.289 --> 00:26:09.299 align:start position:0%
just described and could the troopers on
 
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
the road were encountering individuals
 
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
and subjects throughout their day could
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
they use that same standard
 
00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:18.539 align:start position:0%
um to gather the data as contemplated by
 
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
probably I don't know what the accuracy
 
00:26:24.409 --> 00:26:24.419 align:start position:0%
of that would be if and maybe maybe the
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
intent is not accuracy it's just
 
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
capturing it I don't know but
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
I think the trouble is is is now
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
you know where it's an optional field
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
for us so far as traffic citations go I
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
think if it's immediately apparent
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
and the trooper is so inclined they
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
include that if it's not immediately
 
00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.490 align:start position:0%
include that if it's not immediately
apparent

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
apparent
 
00:26:45.289 --> 00:26:45.299 align:start position:0%
and it you know wouldn't be in the
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
future I think what you're going to get
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
is unknown
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
we could use the same standard to answer
 
00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
your question yes I just fearful of what
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
the reliability or the usefulness of
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
question sir
 
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.710 align:start position:0%
question sir
um

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
individuals were interested in looking
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
at that where would they find those
 
00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:19.799 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that whether
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
that's something that we post on our
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
website whether that's something that we
 
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
print and is publicly available through
 
00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:30.620 align:start position:0%
the Commissioner's Office it is prepared
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
for the commissioner of safety through
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
his office so I don't I don't know
 
00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:36.419 align:start position:0%
whether we physically print that and
 
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
distribute that whether we post that on
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
our website in some capacity
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
what the extent of our distribution of
 
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
um I recognize myself for another
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
question one of my colleagues just asked
 
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
you with regard to a wanted person you
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
know you may put out over the air be on
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
the lookout for uh you know a six foot
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
two white male or black male
 
00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:03.539 align:start position:0%
is that not
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
um often the result of a victim or
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
witness that gave you that description
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
it can be yes
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
that's the question of the share
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
when we were in our briefing we had a
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
thing about the drop down menus or what
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
was actually get a copy of of that the
 
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
drop down menus so that you could see I
 
00:28:27.409 --> 00:28:27.419 align:start position:0%
think other was one of them
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
so I don't think they guess I mean they
 
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
ask and they get an answer and a lot of
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
times they don't know if it's true or
 
00:28:36.289 --> 00:28:36.299 align:start position:0%
not so I think it would it would be a
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the committee just to know
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
what's on the drop down menus they have
 
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
now to understand what data they collect
 
00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
and how and why they collect it
 
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a reasonable request
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
would you be able to provide us with a
 
00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
screenshot yes sir I appreciate it thank
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
you and
 
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
again I
 
00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
race and ethnicity I presume is what the
 
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
committee would be looking for those
 
00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
those two drop downs and what the
 
00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:00.419 align:start position:0%
variables are the only other thing I can
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
add to that real quick is that the FBI
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
has got from what I understand and I
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
haven't had the time to research this
 
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:09.299 align:start position:0%
there's there's two different race lists
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
and and I don't mean to muddy the water
 
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
I just put that out there as there is a
 
00:29:15.769 --> 00:29:15.779 align:start position:0%
a federal standard I suppose as to what
 
00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:18.059 align:start position:0%
the race list is and what the ethnicity
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
ethnicity list is but I will certainly
 
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
provide to the committee what we have
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
currently in that list and I if need be
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
I can determine the origin or the
 
00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:30.299 align:start position:0%
guidelines by which that lift list was
 
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
crafted if need be yeah whatever you
 
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
could provide from both in-house or the
 
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
FBI records we would appreciate our
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you any further
 
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.649 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you any further
questions

00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:42.659 align:start position:0%

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
we have about a 13 14 minutes before our
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and Safety Committee my
 
00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
name is Douglas trottier I am a
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative out of District Six
 
00:46:20.329 --> 00:46:20.339 align:start position:0%
Belknap County serving the town of
 
00:46:20.339 --> 00:46:21.710 align:start position:0%
Belknap County serving the town of
Belmont

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
Belmont
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
I come before you today with more of a
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
housekeeping matter
 
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
um this is going to be in relations to
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
the powers of the New Hampshire Liquor
 
00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
enforcement investigators
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
they currently
 
00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
um get their powers under 179.59
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
however I feel when back in the 90s when
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
these legislative body
 
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
um passed this they made an error
 
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
they gave the Commissioners or the
 
00:46:58.990 --> 00:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
commission the power to hire or appoint
 
00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:02.339 align:start position:0%
investigators and give them the power of
 
00:47:04.609 --> 00:47:04.619 align:start position:0%
any sheriff in any County
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
whereby a sheriff is a constitutional
 
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:10.140 align:start position:0%
officer along with a superior court
 
00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:11.450 align:start position:0%
officer along with a superior court
officer

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
officer
 
00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
and the sheriffs are appointed where
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
liquor investigators are not and at that
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
time when they gave that they did not
 
00:47:20.089 --> 00:47:20.099 align:start position:0%
change the they did not ratify the
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
Constitution to add liquor investigators
 
00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:26.220 align:start position:0%
as a constitutional officer which I
 
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
don't think was their intent so my
 
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
proposal is I think I passed around an
 
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
amendment all I'm trying to do is change
 
00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:38.180 align:start position:0%
the wording
 
00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:41.099 align:start position:0%
from all the powers of the sheriff in
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
any County
 
00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
and replace it with the investigator
 
00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
she'll have powers State wider or powers
 
00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:51.020 align:start position:0%
or jurisdiction throughout the state
 
00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
and pretty much
 
00:47:58.250 --> 00:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:01.140 align:start position:0%
thank you um a quick read of the
 
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
amendment it says that you intend to
 
00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:07.619 align:start position:0%
give them Statewide power over all laws
 
00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
um is it your intent to make them
 
00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
similar to a trooper the ability to
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:21.180 align:start position:0%
basically but sometimes they do go into
 
00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:23.450 align:start position:0%
basically but sometimes they do go into
establishments

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:23.460 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
whereby a cry might happen in their
 
00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
presence and this will allow them to
 
00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:31.140 align:start position:0%
have power to take action well without
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
being questioned if they're authorized
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
representative Gathering
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
So currently if they run into a
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
situation what they have to call the
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
police department
 
00:48:49.849 --> 00:48:49.859 align:start position:0%
no technically they uh
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
under this statue they still have the
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
powers to enforce all laws
 
00:48:57.890 --> 00:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
but my concern is where it says they
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
they powers of a sheriff whereby a
 
00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
sheriff can do civil process being a
 
00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
superior court officer they do have the
 
00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
right to do bails on certain warrants
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
where they're Superior Courts
 
00:49:12.359 --> 00:49:13.250 align:start position:0%
where they're Superior Courts
um

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
but at this point they still liquor
 
00:49:17.809 --> 00:49:17.819 align:start position:0%
investigators do have the power to take
 
00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
action on criminal offenses
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
I am just looking to clarify that so
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
there's no question down the road by an
 
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
representative Platt
 
00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
I recognize that you're not changing
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
wording other than is indicated so
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
you're going from from uh from
 
00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
sheriff in any County to uh Statewide
 
00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction but they can support that
 
00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
concerns me is what you didn't change
 
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
when it says all laws
 
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
because it's not addressing just liquor
 
00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
laws it's all loss and is it is that a
 
00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:52.130 align:start position:0%
laws it's all loss and is it is that a
concern

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:52.140 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:53.329 align:start position:0%
concern
no

00:49:53.329 --> 00:49:53.339 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:55.140 align:start position:0%
um because if something if we say they
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
can only enforce liquor laws and all of
 
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:01.140 align:start position:0%
a sudden they're in an establishment and
 
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
they come across a domestic or an
 
00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.210 align:start position:0%
they come across a domestic or an
assault

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:05.220 align:start position:0%
assault
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
um they cannot take any action or say if
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
they are driving
 
00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:13.140 align:start position:0%
um down the road and they see a
 
00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:13.670 align:start position:0%
um down the road and they see a
um

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
incident happen you know
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
a robbery you
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
know if we say they can only enforce
 
00:50:22.849 --> 00:50:22.859 align:start position:0%
liquor laws they would be able to take
 
00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question are
 
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
there any differences in training
 
00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.470 align:start position:0%
there any differences in training
between

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
um for example a Manchester Police
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
Department Officer and an officer from
 
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission particularly as it
 
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
relates to like
 
00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:49.609 align:start position:0%
relates to like
um

00:50:49.609 --> 00:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
I know that you know in just the last
 
00:50:53.569 --> 00:50:53.579 align:start position:0%
couple of years there's been increases
 
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
in types of training there's been
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
additions to the sort of training that
 
00:51:00.049 --> 00:51:00.059 align:start position:0%
police tend to go through to get them up
 
00:51:01.609 --> 00:51:01.619 align:start position:0%
to date on certain
 
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
you know Community concerns
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
investigator a fire marshal so that pot
 
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
there is no different training but where
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
they specialize in liquor and you know
 
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
title um
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
at uh correction 13.
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
um they do have their own in-house
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
training and they specialize in that
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
area but I believe the chief is here and
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
might be testifying today so he could
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
explain a little more about their
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
training follow
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my follow-up
 
00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.510 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my follow-up
question

00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
um so is it possible that there's
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
training that a normal City police
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
officer might receive that might better
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
qualify them to deal with a domestic
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
incident for example
 
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
um versus the training that uh long that
 
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
a a police officer from The Liquor
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
Commission might receive uh hold on a
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
second um let's leave that for the chief
 
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
he'll be he knows exactly what training
 
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
any further questions oh did you have a
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
question waves off any further questions
 
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
I just have a just process question
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
about the amendment so the original Law
 
00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:20.339 align:start position:0%
you amended a bunch of stuff in there
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
and now this amendment just just forget
 
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
about that and now this is the amendment
 
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
with the original Law in this one change
 
00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:31.140 align:start position:0%
to it is that correct correct thank you
 
00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:40.849 align:start position:0%
to it is that correct correct thank you
representative

00:52:40.849 --> 00:52:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.859 --> 00:52:42.530 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:43.430 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
it appears that the amendment makes uh
 
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh or whatever enforcers more
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
more law enforcement rather than taking
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
if you actually run into occasion where
 
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
you are helping other law enforcement
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
is that not what the case is no that's
 
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
not the intent the main focus will be
 
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
under the liquor law you know title 13.
 
00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.530 align:start position:0%
under the liquor law you know title 13.
um

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
and what they specialize in but for an
 
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:28.250 align:start position:0%
and what they specialize in but for an
example

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
say if all of a sudden there's a police
 
00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
officer on the side of the road that
 
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:37.140 align:start position:0%
involves saying a motor vehicle stop and
 
00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:39.059 align:start position:0%
a liquor investigator is coming along
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
and that officer is being assaulted
 
00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:44.579 align:start position:0%
this will give them the power to stop
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
and help because they will have the
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
right to
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
take action under criminal law it's not
 
00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:53.220 align:start position:0%
their primary function but this will
 
00:53:58.450 --> 00:53:58.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
dozen of the original Bill take care of
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
that situation
 
00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:07.140 align:start position:0%
it does like I said my main concern is
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
where it says they shall have all the
 
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
powers of a sheriff in any County which
 
00:54:15.849 --> 00:54:15.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
yes but you're the amendment that you're
 
00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
proposing gives much broader power to
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
the liquor enforcement people than your
 
00:54:29.569 --> 00:54:29.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it's going to I mean
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
originally when I put in there that they
 
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
should focus on that
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
I did a little re more research and that
 
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
would restrict them my original bill
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
would restrict them from taking actions
 
00:54:44.089 --> 00:54:44.099 align:start position:0%
so if all of a sudden they were out and
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
about and they came across an assault a
 
00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.290 align:start position:0%
about and they came across an assault a
robbery

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
robbery
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
even a homicide
 
00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:53.819 align:start position:0%
they could not take action without
 
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
the authority of the local
 
00:54:59.450 --> 00:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency which that delay
 
00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:01.740 align:start position:0%
could be the difference between life and
 
00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:02.630 align:start position:0%
could be the difference between life and
death

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
death
 
00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
approaches us and we decide to put in a
 
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm just wondering it was
 
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention you know
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
being retired law enforcement and I am
 
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
still a part-time deputy and this was
 
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention and it was a
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
concern when I read the statute
 
00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
and knowing that a sheriff and the
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
deputies uh our sheriff is a
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional officer which is
 
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
um stated in our New Hampshire
 
00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:45.140 align:start position:0%
Constitution under 2 article 71.
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
so when this was brought to my attention
 
00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
I did some research and was concerned
 
00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
about it I have spoken with the Attorney
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
General's office about this and I also
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
spoke with representative Lynn who's a
 
00:55:59.329 --> 00:55:59.339 align:start position:0%
former Chief Justice of the Supreme
 
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
Court and
 
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
he thought that the body back in the 90s
 
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:11.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:24.839 align:start position:0%
oh it works now thank you these are
 
00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:26.579 align:start position:0%
pretty smart mics
 
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
um thanks for taking another question
 
00:56:30.589 --> 00:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
um on on that
 
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
um wavelength uh was there like an
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
incident that occurred where someone was
 
00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
unable to take action which inspired
 
00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:40.740 align:start position:0%
this legislation or um
 
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
something similar uh not that I'm aware
 
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:44.930 align:start position:0%
something similar uh not that I'm aware
of

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
but I saw that it could be a problem
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
um down the road if an attorney gets
 
00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
hold this hold hold of this or they want
 
00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
to challenge this this might be a
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
challenge in the court so I figured that
 
00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
I would try to stop it before we got to
 
00:57:02.089 --> 00:57:02.099 align:start position:0%
that point so we have to pay
 
00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:08.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
there we know further questions the
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
witness is excused and I would call
 
00:57:16.319 --> 00:57:18.049 align:start position:0%
witness is excused and I would call
um

00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:20.089 --> 00:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Liquor Commission
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
I cannot pronounce the last name because
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
I can't read it as Meg you go ahead and
 
00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
just say it
 
00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
I always say if they hack up my name
 
00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
they'll know who I am
 
00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:40.910 align:start position:0%
they'll know who I am
uh

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:43.260 align:start position:0%

00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Mark armaganian I am the

00:58:08.809 --> 00:58:08.819 align:start position:0%
this appointment I was our 28 years I
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
should say I was a bureau Commander with
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.569 --> 00:58:19.579 align:start position:0%
as as representative trottier has stated
 
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
this is a housekeeping issue
 
00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
um oh I'm sorry and with me today is uh
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Danielle Elston who's the
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
commander of our field operations could
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
you make sure she fills out a pink card
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
before she leaves please thank you
 
00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:36.059 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
um this this was brought to our
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
attention uh as a housekeeping issue not
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
to reiterate what representative
 
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
trottier had stated that was exactly
 
00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
what he had stated to me
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
um representative trottier myself back
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
in the early 90s worked together so
 
00:58:56.089 --> 00:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
there was a good pre-established
 
00:58:58.130 --> 00:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
relationship to have a very candid
 
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
conversation and exactly what he spoke
 
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
to all of you about he spoke to me about
 
00:59:08.809 --> 00:59:08.819 align:start position:0%
um this issue this this circumstance or
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
or well it's called an issue has never
 
00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
been brought up since 1990 but it was an
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
issue of housekeeping
 
00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
um it does not change our jurisdiction
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
um our jurisdiction stays the same
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
um for some of the reasons and more so
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
than uh What uh representative trottier
 
00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:32.220 align:start position:0%
had stated to all of you there are
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances and incidents throughout
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
several jurisdictions in the state that
 
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
uh have become life safety issues that
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
um given our jurisdiction uh we would
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
not be able to act upon given that we
 
00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:49.140 align:start position:0%
would not be able to act upon especially
 
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
when they come to alcohol related
 
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
incidents uh State V welding 1984 would
 
00:59:57.650 --> 00:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
actually create liability for the State
 
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh because police officers are
 
01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:05.579 align:start position:0%
given the duty to actually take action
 
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
take minors into custody and release
 
01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
them to their parents so uh case out of
 
01:00:13.809 --> 01:00:13.819 align:start position:0%
Kingston of course
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
very well known through the law
 
01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement Community
 
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
actually is what governs our actions
 
01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
when it comes to that
 
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
um so again uh when it was brought to
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
our attention like uh
 
01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
representative trottier had stated
 
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:35.220 align:start position:0%
um there are policies and procedures
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
that are solidified book markers if you
 
01:00:41.329 --> 01:00:41.339 align:start position:0%
will that are solidified in title 13 but
 
01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
there are times like I say life safety
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
times that we are traveling from point A
 
01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:49.140 align:start position:0%
to point B and have come across things
 
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
and we mentioned the city of Manchester
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh one of our best Partners
 
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
um and uh I will tell you that we are
 
01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:01.559 align:start position:0%
very close with uh Chief aldenberg
 
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
um and and one of the things he's been
 
01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
very vocal about and I'm sorry that I
 
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't testify on his behalf
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
but he's been very vocal about us doing
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
our jobs and they do their jobs and and
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
he appreciates Us in the city of
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester and some of the other larger
 
01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:23.450 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:01:25.609 --> 01:01:25.619 align:start position:0%
other than that I would be reiterating
 
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative calling you recognized
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
chief for taking the question can you

please for my own knowledge and
 
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
background and forgive the committee if
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
if this is widely known but can you
 
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
describe what the role of your law
 
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers are and
 
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which
 
01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
um they might encounter uh criminal
 
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
activity that is beyond their scope and
 
01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
then what would be the response of that
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
officer absolutely thank you for the
 
01:01:59.089 --> 01:01:59.099 align:start position:0%
question representative uh first and
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
foremost it was brought up earlier
 
01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.789 align:start position:0%
foremost it was brought up earlier
training

01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
um all of our sworn investigators go
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
through the New Hampshire Police Academy
 
01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:08.839 align:start position:0%
they are full-time sworn police officers
 
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
we do have a part-time contingent that
 
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
our police officers also that have
 
01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
either gone through part-time training
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
or their full-time police officers who
 
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
have now gone to a part-time status
 
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:23.630 align:start position:0%
have now gone to a part-time status
um

01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
when it comes to circumstances uh to I
 
01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:30.500 align:start position:0%
think the most prevalent one uh happened
 
01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:33.299 align:start position:0%
probably within the last couple years we
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
had an investigator that actually was at
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
a traffic light coming back to our
 
01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:39.299 align:start position:0%
headquarters on store Street here in
 
01:02:39.299 --> 01:02:40.609 align:start position:0%
headquarters on store Street here in
Concord

01:02:40.609 --> 01:02:40.619 align:start position:0%
Concord
 
01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
um at the lights right be on South Main
 
01:02:45.049 --> 01:02:45.059 align:start position:0%
Street right before uh getting to Dunkin
 
01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
Donuts for a landmark if you will
 
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
um the car in front of him was not
 
01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:52.490 align:start position:0%
um the car in front of him was not
moving

01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
moving
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
and the cycle of Lights had gone through
 
01:03:00.049 --> 01:03:00.059 align:start position:0%
um the uh investigator at that point
 
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
initiated a stop
 
01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
um realized that the person was not
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
responding made contact with the
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
operator the car who was slumped over
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
the wheel and actually overdosing
 
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
um so that felt totally into a life
 
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
safety situation Concord Police
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
Department was called to assist to to
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
transfer any criminal activity that was
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
found out of that vehicle that's by
 
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.750 align:start position:0%
found out of that vehicle that's by
policy

01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:30.059 align:start position:0%
in in uh like representative trottier
 
01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
had had brought up traveling from point
 
01:03:35.329 --> 01:03:35.339 align:start position:0%
A to point B
 
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
um we come across a a traffic accident
 
01:03:40.849 --> 01:03:40.859 align:start position:0%
in inclement weather
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
um we would actually stop we have a duty
 
01:03:46.849 --> 01:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
Life Safety duty to stop
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
um and and notify State Police if we're
 
01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:51.299 align:start position:0%
on the highway or that jurisdiction that
 
01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:53.339 align:start position:0%
we're on to transfer
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
um our our whatever it might be our
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
probable cause because as a as a
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
civilian witness if you will
 
01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
there's no you're a witness there's no
 
01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
transfer of probable cause but police
 
01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
officers in this state can transfer
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
probable cause to each other for
 
01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:13.140 align:start position:0%
purposes of Warrant or or arrest so if
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
there was something that we came across
 
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
and we had to transfer that authority to
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
a traditional law enforcement entity we
 
01:04:22.809 --> 01:04:22.819 align:start position:0%
could do that
 
01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
representative Conley you recognize for
 
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
a follow-up thank you and thank you for
 
01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
that uh detailed answer so in short
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
though and I appreciate the
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative describe this in his
 
01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
intro is that you're not out there
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
responding to calls over the radio
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
you're it's things you come across that
 
01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
you would then respond to and then await
 
01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
uh the local jurisdiction is that
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
correct correct we we don't want to
 
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
serve civil paperwork there is a
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Department in each of the 10
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
counties of this great state that that
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
cover that
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
um the powers to be back in 1990 thought
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
it was a easier way there was no
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
pushback from from the sheriff's
 
01:05:05.329 --> 01:05:05.339 align:start position:0%
Association at the time
 
01:05:08.089 --> 01:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
um there still isn't other than a
 
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
housekeeping issue and it doesn't change
 
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
the way we do business this bill does
 
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
not change the way we do business I
 
01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
can't state that enough
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
oh if if I may
 
01:05:21.289 --> 01:05:21.299 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry to interrupt you
 
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
representative we on anything that is
 
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
considered outside of title 13 Life
 
01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
Safety wise we have to in the in the
 
01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
interest of transparency we quarterly
 
01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
report to Commerce
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
um in in written form and that is found
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
on our website too in the interest of
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
this Administration we put together a
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
brand new Administration when I came
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
over from State Police
 
01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:51.059 align:start position:0%
um the face of the Command Staff has
 
01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
totally changed a hundred percent uh
 
01:05:55.970 --> 01:05:55.980 align:start position:0%
with that face changing there's a
 
01:05:58.970 --> 01:05:58.980 align:start position:0%
transparency that came along with it and
 
01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
as in I think uh so and I apologize I
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
didn't I don't remember who brought it
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
up uh the liac commission that was just
 
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
formed by the governor
 
01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
um we're the first state agency that
 
01:06:12.049 --> 01:06:12.059 align:start position:0%
actually got to the Finish Line because
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
we do business that way so all the all
 
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
the recommendations of Lee act are
 
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
actually completed and we're the first
 
01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
ones to complete that and on top of we
 
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
are the only ones that will within the
 
01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative Roy you're recognized for
 
01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:37.140 align:start position:0%
taking my question so currently this is
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
going to be a couple part question
 
01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
currently you have powers of arrest
 
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
with regard to liquor violations
 
01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
this would give you powers of arrest
 
01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
with regard to all crimes where do you
 
01:06:54.109 --> 01:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
transport arrestees to do you have a
 
01:06:55.789 --> 01:06:55.799 align:start position:0%
holding facility of your own do you take
 
01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
them to the local jurisdictions how does
 
01:07:00.529 --> 01:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
that work no we do take them to either
 
01:07:03.529 --> 01:07:03.539 align:start position:0%
local jurisdictions or to the House of
 
01:07:03.539 --> 01:07:05.329 align:start position:0%
local jurisdictions or to the House of
Corrections

01:07:05.329 --> 01:07:05.339 align:start position:0%
Corrections
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
um I would say a majority of our our
 
01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:12.299 align:start position:0%
infractions are handled administratively
 
01:07:14.349 --> 01:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
01:07:17.089 --> 01:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
produced a
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
um a
 
01:07:18.839 --> 01:07:21.230 align:start position:0%
um a
softly

01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
softly
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
um what's the best way to say it
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
um procedure of accountability
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
and it starts with our education program
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
um and works up from there so those
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
instances of of full custodial arrest
 
01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:42.299 align:start position:0%
are are there they do happen 100 but
 
01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
they they don't happen as often as they
 
01:07:48.529 --> 01:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
would in some of our traditional police
 
01:07:48.539 --> 01:07:49.910 align:start position:0%
would in some of our traditional police
departments

01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
departments
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
I had the original bill
 
01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:06.059 align:start position:0%
I saw that it was limiting the
 
01:08:06.059 --> 01:08:07.569 align:start position:0%
I saw that it was limiting the
enforcement

01:08:07.569 --> 01:08:07.579 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
abilities for Liquor Commission
 
01:08:12.359 --> 01:08:17.570 align:start position:0%
abilities for Liquor Commission
officers

01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
it limited the powers of law liquor Law
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
Officers yes
 
01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:27.179 align:start position:0%
and and the amendment which
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh does all it does is limit it cannot
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
sir officers cannot serve papers and do
 
01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:36.229 align:start position:0%
sir officers cannot serve papers and do
sure

01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
I'd I'd like to limit because a it gives
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
you the pro your Law Enforcement
 
01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
Officers the uh priority of enforcing
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
liquor laws and I'm sure that they have
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
plenty to do there absolutely
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:08:55.729 --> 01:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
gives them broader and law enforcement
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
powers and in fact they can
 
01:09:03.169 --> 01:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
enforce traffic laws if I'm if I'm not
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
mistaken and I've heard rumors about
 
01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
long liquor Enforcement Officers
 
01:09:10.249 --> 01:09:10.259 align:start position:0%
representative board name is there a
 
01:09:10.259 --> 01:09:13.910 align:start position:0%
representative board name is there a
question

01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.169 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:09:15.169 --> 01:09:15.179 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:09:15.179 --> 01:09:17.709 align:start position:0%
yes
uh

01:09:17.709 --> 01:09:17.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.289 --> 01:09:21.299 align:start position:0%
participating high-speed chases
 
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
is this really what we want to do or do
 
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
we want to go back to the bill as as
 
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
presented I think to answer this
 
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
correctly first of all thank you for
 
01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
your question representative
 
01:09:36.370 --> 01:09:36.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm here in this building to also
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
dispel any misrepresentations or
 
01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
false information that has been put out
 
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
there to many committees there are no
 
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
Pursuits going on
 
01:09:50.809 --> 01:09:50.819 align:start position:0%
there are none under this Administration
 
01:09:53.809 --> 01:09:53.819 align:start position:0%
or previous Administrations
 
01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
um there is policy intact that actually
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
prohibits us from pursuing vehicles and
 
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
I want to make that very clear there is
 
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
there is management oversight in the
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
highest regard to make sure that the
 
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
rules that that are presented to gel car
 
01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
and are set forth for us that solidify
 
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
the laws of this state are are intact it
 
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
does not broaden our it's the same
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction as what we have right now
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
it does not broaden that view at all it
 
01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
keeps it intact and to be quite honest
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
about it when we first looked at that
 
01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:36.659 align:start position:0%
original version of the bill uh
 
01:10:38.689 --> 01:10:38.699 align:start position:0%
representative trottier and I hadn't
 
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
spoken to each other and he did not
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
realize the book markers if you will the
 
01:10:46.090 --> 01:10:46.100 align:start position:0%
book markers that have been in place
 
01:10:49.729 --> 01:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there were only life
 
01:10:51.649 --> 01:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
safety issues we do not want to run
 
01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
radar on 93 North
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:57.910 align:start position:0%
um I've commanded the people that do
that

01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
would State Police it's a different
 
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
Mission altogether
 
01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:07.140 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:30.610 --> 01:11:30.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative Newman please speak into
 
01:11:35.209 --> 01:11:35.219 align:start position:0%
the microphone
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
and to the members in the on the
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
committee if you're not speaking uh
 
01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
please turn off your microphone because
 
01:11:41.699 --> 01:11:43.090 align:start position:0%
please turn off your microphone because
that

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:43.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:45.169 --> 01:11:45.179 align:start position:0%
might the audio will come out through
 
01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:49.850 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
so my my question is you mentioned a
 
01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
constitutional officer
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
and then so it's in conflict with what
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
other type of Officer yeah just just to
 
01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
clarify I I did not bring that up uh
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
that is what was brought up by
 
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
representative trottier
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
um I quite honestly do not have an issue
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
with our jurisdiction
 
01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
um I do believe that it is housekeeping
 
01:12:17.689 --> 01:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
and and I accept that and and that's as
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
written on this amendment that is the
 
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
only reason why we're supporting this
 
01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
it's not to restrict our ability from
 
01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
what we have right now because
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
um as you will see and they they can

business on a daily basis
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the answer
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
represent Newman you recognize for a
 
01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.130 align:start position:0%
represent Newman you recognize for a
follow-up

01:12:58.130 --> 01:12:58.140 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
I was just trying to get the name of the
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
the distinction that was made by someone
 
01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
else that testified sorry say something
 
01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:05.930 align:start position:0%
else that testified sorry say something
about

01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
so there was previous testimony
 
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
that mentioned a series of
 
01:13:17.209 --> 01:13:17.219 align:start position:0%
law enforcement type investigators
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
that have that kind of pro do all are
 
01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
there other types of law enforcement
 
01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:24.470 align:start position:0%
there other types of law enforcement
investigators

01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
investigators
 
01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
other than liquor enforcement that have
 
01:13:31.090 --> 01:13:31.100 align:start position:0%
these types of
 
01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:34.140 align:start position:0%
powers absolutely that great question
 
01:13:37.729 --> 01:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
representative so uh there are off the
 
01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:39.659 align:start position:0%
top of my head on on the state level
 
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:13:44.810 --> 01:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
five six other regulatory agencies or
 
01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
entities let's call them because we know
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
what agencies are concerned in state
 
01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.990 align:start position:0%
what agencies are concerned in state
business

01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
um ourselves fish and game uh Troop G
 
01:13:57.250 --> 01:13:57.260 align:start position:0%
over at uh State Police
 
01:14:00.370 --> 01:14:00.380 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol Fire Marshal's office
 
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
we need our jurisdiction to navigate to
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
be quite honest about it you can't
 
01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:09.780 align:start position:0%
navigate through the these industries
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
separate Industries without it's by room
 
01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
by policy that we put book markers on it
 
01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
we make sure that our people don't do
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
jobs that quite honestly are assigned or
 
01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
or point at other agencies traditional
 
01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:29.510 align:start position:0%
or point at other agencies traditional
agencies

01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
if I can defer to Lieutenant Alston to
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
title 13 investigations that we
 
01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:45.229 align:start position:0%
title 13 investigations that we
encounter

01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
encounter
 
01:14:47.090 --> 01:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
come with an administrative and a
 
01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:49.340 align:start position:0%
criminal component and many of them are
 
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
multi-jurisdictional for example a
 
01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
fatality the fatality might have
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
occurred in one jurisdiction while the
 
01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
individual might have been drinking at
 
01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
life's establishments in multiple
 
01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions throughout that night so
 
01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
the reason one of the reasons that we
 
01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:06.780 align:start position:0%
need the broad law enforcement power is
 
01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
there are sometimes simultaneous
 
01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
administrative and criminal
 
01:15:11.689 --> 01:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
investigations that can occur within
 
01:15:14.450 --> 01:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
title 13 that range through multiple
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions referencing one incident
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
so this allows us to navigate that
 
01:15:21.649 --> 01:15:21.659 align:start position:0%
without having to disrupt the local
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities to to be involved in each
 
01:15:29.169 --> 01:15:29.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
and if I'm sorry Mr chair
 
01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:36.620 align:start position:0%
just just to add to that and back in
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
2014 there is case law at the Supreme
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
Court level that actually solidifies our
 
01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:48.179 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction uh to maneuver and and also
 
01:15:50.450 --> 01:15:50.460 align:start position:0%
states that without that jurisdiction
 
01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
quote it would impede the investigators
 
01:15:56.090 --> 01:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
from doing their daily duties
 
01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:57.350 align:start position:0%
from doing their daily duties
yeah

01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
and I can give the reference if you
 
01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
would like that thank you thank you
 
01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:04.199 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question what I'm hearing you
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
your jurisdiction what this is saying is
 
01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
if you are present in a situation and
 
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
something bad is happening it would give
 
01:16:25.729 --> 01:16:25.739 align:start position:0%
you the ability to take action
 
01:16:28.729 --> 01:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
but also simultaneously call the local
 
01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and say this is what is
 
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
happening and this is what I'm doing get
 
01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
somebody over here
 
01:16:39.410 --> 01:16:39.420 align:start position:0%

representative testerman thank you
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
that question
 
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
as as it's amended
 
01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
uh is going to give you some amount of
 
01:16:56.219 --> 01:16:57.890 align:start position:0%
uh is going to give you some amount of
authority

01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:16:59.450 --> 01:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
if this bill
 
01:17:02.209 --> 01:17:02.219 align:start position:0%
did not happen would it affect how you
 
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
representative true

thank you Mr chair and thank you chief

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:26.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:17:26.450 --> 01:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
as the law
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
reads now
 
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.510 align:start position:0%
reads now
correct

01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
when the commission
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
appoints a liquor investigator
 
01:17:39.649 --> 01:17:39.659 align:start position:0%
whether he's
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
full-time or part-time
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
do they all immediately assume
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
um they so we have different missions so
 
01:17:57.169 --> 01:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
so I and the only reason I want to
 
01:17:59.450 --> 01:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
clarify that is
 
01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
they are keeping our highways and byways
 
01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
safe under 106 b
 
01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
um which is their jurisdiction statue so
 
01:18:11.209 --> 01:18:11.219 align:start position:0%
do we do we all have the same
 
01:18:15.850 --> 01:18:15.860 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in its broadest sense yes
 
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
but Rule and policy
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
draw that back to to the book markers
 
01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
that we created and and those book
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
markers are this agency this division of
 
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission will not go
 
01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
outside to title 13 unless it's a life
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.689 --> 01:18:38.699 align:start position:0%
representative true you recognize for a
 
01:18:38.699 --> 01:18:39.470 align:start position:0%
representative true you recognize for a
follow-up

01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you so again
 
01:18:45.770 --> 01:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
I won't do that I did it once you did it
 
01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:46.490 align:start position:0%
I won't do that I did it once you did it
great

01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:48.110 align:start position:0%
great
um

01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
so when a
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
an investigator or a part-time
 
01:18:54.239 --> 01:18:56.709 align:start position:0%
an investigator or a part-time
investigator

01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
investigator
 
01:18:59.930 --> 01:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
becomes uh is appointed by the
 
01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:00.890 align:start position:0%
becomes uh is appointed by the
commission

01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
when do they go through the complete
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
State Police
 
01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
training academy and that that includes
 
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
part-time I assume they all must
 
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
complete that before
 
01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
they become
 
01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:20.699 align:start position:0%
an appointed liquor investigator so we
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
we swear first of all uh the state
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
police doesn't own the police academy
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
the academy it has its own Council
 
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
um uh just to clarify that
 
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
um under director skippa uh who's who's
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
there uh uh it their uh commander and
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
and I I will say uh happily an academy
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
classmate of mine so there's a great
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
relationship there
 
01:19:51.169 --> 01:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
um our investigators get sworn in uh
 
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
when they get sworn in then we we own
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
them as employees
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
um it's at that point that they go
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
immediately to the police academy
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
whether in a part-time or full-time
 
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.149 align:start position:0%
whether in a part-time or full-time
status

01:20:05.149 --> 01:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
status
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
um I will nobody goes on the street
 
01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:09.260 align:start position:0%
without the academy
 
01:20:13.729 --> 01:20:13.739 align:start position:0%
and we also have an in-house Academy
 
01:20:13.739 --> 01:20:14.950 align:start position:0%
and we also have an in-house Academy
um

01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
16 weeks I'm sorry uh 16 weeks now that
 
01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
we teach specifically title 13 and the
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
liquor laws of the state and and go over
 
01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
scenario based situations
 
01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
um and those I'm sorry to have my back
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
to you over there
 
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
um I those situations are have been
 
01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
shown and proven to be the foundation of
 
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
of practically teaching Law Enforcement
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
Officers because as we know situations
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
are so fluid and they are totally fluid
 
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
in the establishments that we regulate
 
01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
um where we have had
 
01:20:58.610 --> 01:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
um just uh the representative left
 
01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
um uh in the jurisdiction of Manchester
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
um we we have had a investigator walk in
 
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
to do a regulatory inspection and the
 
01:21:10.610 --> 01:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
first question of his mouth was
 
01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
how's business doing he walked into an
 
01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
armed robbery
 
01:21:21.050 --> 01:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
and and uh was able to take action
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
um was was recognized by the Manchester
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
Police Department
 
01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
um and and there are so many uh the 234
 
01:21:32.209 --> 01:21:32.219 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions throughout the state I we
 
01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
don't have a bad uh relationship with
 
01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
any one of those jurisdictions
 
01:21:40.850 --> 01:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
um and I know some of them are yours
 
01:21:43.729 --> 01:21:43.739 align:start position:0%
um I always leave my uh phone number
 
01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:48.179 align:start position:0%
with everybody uh uh Monday through uh
 
01:21:50.630 --> 01:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
Sunday all hours of the day or night
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of and and if I can uh
 
01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of there is a lot of
 
01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.950 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of there is a lot of
misinformation

01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
misinformation
 
01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
um that that has been brought up uh like
 
01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
the representative had had brought up I
 
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
I want to dispel that and and the only
 
01:22:08.810 --> 01:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
way to do that is for all of you and
 
01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
those that are listening to us right now
 
01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
to call me uh I will dispel that
 
01:22:17.209 --> 01:22:17.219 align:start position:0%
immediately uh because we have a good
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
product that we have put together in the
 
01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
last four and a half years and it is at
 
01:22:25.870 --> 01:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.209 --> 01:22:29.219 align:start position:0%
representative Greene
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
question uh what type of vehicles do you
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
use are they marked or unmarked and how
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
are they equipped
 
01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
they are they are
 
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
um equipped with
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
um Emergency Equipment that would
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
actually be
 
01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:47.219 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh place in them to stop a vehicle
 
01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
um you have to also recognize that there
 
01:22:56.209 --> 01:22:56.219 align:start position:0%
are circumstances such as uh miners
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
transporting alcohol and and uh
 
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
possession of alcohol that we we
 
01:23:05.149 --> 01:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
actually have to and are charged with
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
the duties of taking action upon those
 
01:23:08.159 --> 01:23:09.530 align:start position:0%
the duties of taking action upon those
people

01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
um they don't happen that often but they
 
01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:12.250 align:start position:0%
um they don't happen that often but they
do

01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:12.260 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
they are in uh police uh vehicles
 
01:23:19.729 --> 01:23:19.739 align:start position:0%
um I will tell you that after doing an
 
01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
assessment when I first came in that
 
01:23:27.649 --> 01:23:27.659 align:start position:0%
I can get a vehicle such as that cheaper
 
01:23:29.810 --> 01:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
than a civilian vehicle and it'll last
 
01:23:32.330 --> 01:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
me longer so in the interest of being
 
01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible
 
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
um I it's a better vehicle it lasts
 
01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:38.090 align:start position:0%
um I it's a better vehicle it lasts
longer

01:23:38.090 --> 01:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
longer
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh more more like six to seven years
 
01:23:45.050 --> 01:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
green recognized for a follow-up
 
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
this should pass would you need addition
 
01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
we're not changing business at all
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative Roy
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.490 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

01:24:00.490 --> 01:24:00.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
I think in the general there's a there's
 
01:24:06.290 --> 01:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
a a perception of you know operating
 
01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
during the daytime coming around with a
 
01:24:10.130 --> 01:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
clipboard checking stuff
 
01:24:12.169 --> 01:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
is your job in fact it's sometimes
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
dangerous do you sometimes go into bars
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
late at night in situations that are you
 
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
know not not just your average uh liquor
 
01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
store yeah thank you sir appreciate the
 
01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
question yes um we do work in the
 
01:24:26.570 --> 01:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
evenings our job is to regulate the
 
01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
industry when is most of this industry
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
Oakland late night we are out Thursday
 
01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
Friday Saturday nights we are inside
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
these license establishments we are
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%

do checks during the day absolutely we
 
01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
go in we check we make sure your license
 
01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
is posted that you have the the proper
 
01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
signage for the IDS but there are times
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
at night where we're in these licensed
 
01:24:47.630 --> 01:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
establishments and I can tell you within
 
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
the last four years and just for
 
01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
reference I've been with liquor
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement for 13 years
 
01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
we have been called on by the local
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
agencies to go check the bars at night
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
they have called and said hey we have a
 
01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
report of a minor inside this license
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
establishment can you help us with this
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
hey we have a report that there's
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
um you know there's illegal activity
 
01:25:10.370 --> 01:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
occurring inside this license
 
01:25:12.169 --> 01:25:12.179 align:start position:0%
establishment can you help it help us
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
with this we've also had local
 
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions say hey this place is out
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
of control they're serving you
 
01:25:19.970 --> 01:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
responsibly they're serving to minors
 
01:25:22.189 --> 01:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
can you help us with this and that does
 
01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
involve us going into these licensed
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
establishments and well you know for
 
01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:29.219 align:start position:0%
clarification purposes one example I'd
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
also like to give is we're talking about
 
01:25:33.169 --> 01:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
you know some of these extreme examples
 
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
but even our interactions with patrons
 
01:25:38.630 --> 01:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
tend to to go sideways very quick
 
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
we part of our purpose is looking for
 
01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
over served individuals these are
 
01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
individuals who are intoxicated and who
 
01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
don't always respond the way we would
 
01:25:51.890 --> 01:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
like them to respond so a simple
 
01:25:54.169 --> 01:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
um incident of asking an intoxicated
 
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
individual to leave a licensed
 
01:25:57.890 --> 01:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
establishment can go sideways very quick
 
01:26:00.290 --> 01:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
they become combative they become
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
belligerent they become disorderly and
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
the delay to have to call the local
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
police department especially in a time
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
where many of these agencies are running
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
well below staff as it is to have them
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
come and handle that when we have the
 
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
ability to do that immediately
 
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
immediately safely Rectify that
 
01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.450 align:start position:0%
immediately safely Rectify that
situation

01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
um this is this is the reason for those
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
Powers but ever those incidents of us
 
01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
being inside these late nights they are
 
01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
dangerous we've had investigators who
 
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
have been down the road from a shooting
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
that has occurred inside a licensed
 
01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
establishment we've had recently had
 
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
shootings inside license establishments
 
01:26:39.070 --> 01:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
that it's very likely we could be inside
 
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
so these the reason for this this the
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that we have have is so
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we can deal with those immediately
 
01:26:51.169 --> 01:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
because they do tend to turn into
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
bigger instances
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:57.410 --> 01:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
and if I may representative
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
um uh one of the things that has become
 
01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
very prevalent uh since and and we have
 
01:27:06.410 --> 01:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
changed a lot of business and it would
 
01:27:08.930 --> 01:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
be a laundry list to tell you exactly
 
01:27:11.209 --> 01:27:11.219 align:start position:0%
what we have changed but
 
01:27:13.129 --> 01:27:13.139 align:start position:0%
um there there was a standard of of
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
investigating to our administrative
 
01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.790 align:start position:0%
investigating to our administrative
abilities

01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
abilities
 
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
um and and not so much Beyond A
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Doubt where we would end up
 
01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
in Criminal Court
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
um those instances where since I was
 
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
running an investigative Bureau for the
 
01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
State Police uh which was homicide major
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
crime narcotics and intelligence uh one
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
thing we found very quickly was that the
 
01:27:38.209 --> 01:27:38.219 align:start position:0%
traditional police departments were
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
conceding to our our jurisdiction uh for
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
fatal motor vehicle accidents that
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
pointed to our uh Authority in title 13.
 
01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
so you have probably seen on the news
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
um there have been some very tragic in
 
01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
incidents and and I talked to those
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
parents I I will say at least two three
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
times a week
 
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
um and and assuring them that we will uh
 
01:28:08.810 --> 01:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
really fortify that these these negative
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
incidents don't happen again but
 
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes we don't have control over
 
01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
them we're not investigating the fatal
 
01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:17.990 align:start position:0%
them we're not investigating the fatal
accident

01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
accident
 
01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
that's State Police or the jurisdiction
 
01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
that they're in we're navigating through
 
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
our industry which traditional law
 
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement has has not opted totally
 
01:28:32.689 --> 01:28:32.699 align:start position:0%
out of but but recognizes that this and
 
01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
that this industry has gotten so
 
01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:36.780 align:start position:0%
specialized that it needs a specialized
 
01:28:40.129 --> 01:28:40.139 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency to have oversight
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
um uh three or three different
 
01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions throughout the state
 
01:28:50.649 --> 01:28:50.659 align:start position:0%
geographically way apart from each other
 
01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh at both borders we have been able to
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
navigate through and and they are the
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
the most egregious events that have
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
occurred in those that you've seen on
 
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%
the news and those cases are still open
 
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
right now we're handling them and and we
 
01:29:09.490 --> 01:29:09.500 align:start position:0%
handled them appropriately
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:15.169 --> 01:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
representative Klein Knight
 
01:29:17.689 --> 01:29:17.699 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
01:29:20.090 --> 01:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question apologies if this was
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
already answered as I came in late
 
01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
um these enforcement officers
 
01:29:30.410 --> 01:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
uh would they only be getting involved
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
if there was
 
01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:34.980 align:start position:0%
um some sort of life safety risk as it
 
01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:35.870 align:start position:0%
um some sort of life safety risk as it
says

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
. representative Klein Knight there is a
 
01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
an amendment that
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
although it's not been an introduced or
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
adopted we've been for most part
 
01:29:51.290 --> 01:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
discussing the amendment
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
well I'm just explaining okay
 
01:29:57.050 --> 01:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
I I want to know
 
01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:57.830 align:start position:0%
I I want to know
um

01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
basically what is the jurisdiction on
 
01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
getting involved before then and the
 
01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
ability to put people in sober tanks
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
so the the
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
line that you're referring to is
 
01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:14.270 align:start position:0%
line that you're referring to is
um

01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
in the previous
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
the previous Bill the amendment that has
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
been submitted doesn't change our
 
01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:23.219 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction at all however I can can
 
01:30:25.729 --> 01:30:25.739 align:start position:0%
clarify that a little bit so
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
um much of our purpose inside these
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
licensed establishments is to enforce
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
title 13 in an administrative capacity
 
01:30:33.770 --> 01:30:33.780 align:start position:0%
but there are times when we're
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
investigating those administrative
 
01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
violations that that criminal offenses
 
01:30:40.129 --> 01:30:40.139 align:start position:0%
occur and a small one might be
 
01:30:42.050 --> 01:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
um where they're looking for minors to
 
01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
see if the bar is serving minors and we
 
01:30:45.649 --> 01:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
find a minor in possession of alcohol
 
01:30:47.450 --> 01:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
we would need the ability to
 
01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
appropriately deal with that minor so
 
01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:51.719 align:start position:0%
that they are really safely and in many
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
of these jurisdictions there might not
 
01:30:57.169 --> 01:30:57.179 align:start position:0%
be any law enforcement agencies on or in
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
the other opposition and if you're in
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester or Nashua they're dealing
 
01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
with a incredible a number of calls
 
01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
we're calling them to just simply take
 
01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
custody of the minor to release Superman
 
01:31:12.410 --> 01:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't feasible at that time so the
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction that we have is again
 
01:31:16.970 --> 01:31:16.980 align:start position:0%
within the course it gives us Statewide
 
01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction because there are licenses
 
01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and we need to
 
01:31:21.649 --> 01:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
regulate those licensees but there are
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
instances when we're in the process of
 
01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with our administrative
 
01:31:28.610 --> 01:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
capacity that criminal instances occur
 
01:31:30.169 --> 01:31:30.179 align:start position:0%
in our presence
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
um another example again on a small
 
01:31:34.729 --> 01:31:34.739 align:start position:0%
level would be similar to what I gave
 
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
before is we're there we find an
 
01:31:38.450 --> 01:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
intoxicated Patron we work with the
 
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
establishment to shut that Patron off
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
and get them home safely but sometimes
 
01:31:44.209 --> 01:31:44.219 align:start position:0%
they don't always leave cooperatively so
 
01:31:45.890 --> 01:31:45.900 align:start position:0%
if the establishment is asking them to
 
01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
leave and they start becoming disorderly
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
or disruptive then we have the law
 
01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
enforcement authority to appropriately
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
deal with that individual as we need we
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
do have the ability for protective
 
01:31:58.010 --> 01:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
custody which I think is what you're
 
01:31:59.629 --> 01:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
you're speaking of where if an
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
individual is incapacitated we would
 
01:32:04.970 --> 01:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
have the ability to to take them into
 
01:32:06.649 --> 01:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
custody ensure that they are are then
 
01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:08.699 align:start position:0%
dealt with safely release them to a
 
01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
sober party or bring them to a sober
 
01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
facility or to to we that comes within
 
01:32:15.169 --> 01:32:15.179 align:start position:0%
the authority and we have encountered
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
that at licensed establishments before
 
01:32:19.010 --> 01:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
we have encountered incapacitated
 
01:32:23.209 --> 01:32:23.219 align:start position:0%
patrons that need immediate assistance
 
01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
thank you and if I can just add to that
 
01:32:28.850 --> 01:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
um and this happened just recently and
 
01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
you'd sit back and say how dumb uh we
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
went to do a final inspection on one of
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
our prospective license establishments
 
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
and when the investigator walked in
 
01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
there were two miners at the bar uh
 
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
extremely intoxicated
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
um but but even better than that
 
01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:48.780 align:start position:0%
um because we're talking about a lot of
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
negative here this is probably one of
 
01:32:53.209 --> 01:32:53.219 align:start position:0%
the first times that industry has
 
01:32:56.990 --> 01:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
supported this agency as a whole and and
 
01:33:00.250 --> 01:33:00.260 align:start position:0%
I will say that restaurants and lodging
 
01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:02.709 align:start position:0%
I will say that restaurants and lodging
wholesalers

01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
wholesalers
 
01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
Grocers Association and and also our
 
01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
manufacturers have like the way business
 
01:33:13.010 --> 01:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
is being done because their success a
 
01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
successful business we regulate to the
 
01:33:17.209 --> 01:33:17.219 align:start position:0%
point of industry and Community safety
 
01:33:20.090 --> 01:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
keeping our kids safe our vulnerable age
 
01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:21.780 align:start position:0%
kids safe
 
01:33:25.370 --> 01:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
if a business is successful we are
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
successful if our people write no
 
01:33:31.370 --> 01:33:31.380 align:start position:0%
administrative fines or take criminal
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
action that means our our platform for
 
01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
education is working
 
01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:39.540 align:start position:0%
so so I hope I'm I'm making all of you
 
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
comfortable knowing that there there are
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
management controls that are here that
 
01:33:49.070 --> 01:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
are keeping this this agency this
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you both for your testimony thank
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:20.570 --> 01:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
I I believe you both need to fill out a
 
01:34:27.050 --> 01:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
all right Chief can you can you please
 
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
spell your name for the clerk
 
01:34:33.890 --> 01:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
just just for the clerk for the record
 
01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
can you please spell your name
 
01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's bad enough we can't pronounce we
 
01:34:56.050 --> 01:34:56.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
this time we will now close the public
 
01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:12.709 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
1475.

01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
at this time we'll now open the public
 
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:21.709 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
1031

01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
it might be easier to pass around
 
01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of wires here and
 
01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159 align:start position:0%
I hate to
 
01:35:33.709 --> 01:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
eat this
 
01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
and uh at this time the chair recognized
 
01:35:50.890 --> 01:35:50.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative the floor is yours
 
01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and uh thank you uh
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
house criminal justice and Public Safety
 
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
Committee for having me today
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh my name is representative Tony
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
lebranch and I represent the town of
 
01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:11.159 align:start position:0%
Amherst I'm here today to introduce
 
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1031 which would prohibit
 
01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
police departments from encrypting their
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
Communications unless under exceptional
 
01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:19.310 align:start position:0%
Communications unless under exceptional
situations

01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
situations
 
01:36:20.689 --> 01:36:20.699 align:start position:0%
this actually was the case up until
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
recently Nash was the only city to my
 
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
knowledge but has decided to permanently
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
encrypt their police frequencies doing
 
01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
so only a few years ago
 
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
almost every single community in the
 
01:36:32.689 --> 01:36:32.699 align:start position:0%
state does not encrypt their frequencies
 
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
unless something extraordinary does
 
01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:35.390 align:start position:0%
unless something extraordinary does
occur

01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
occur
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
that was the practice for decades and
 
01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to bring us back to that
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to balance the interests
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
of Public Safety in the interest of the
 
01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
public and government transparency and I
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
believe this bill does that
 
01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
this bill is bipartisan and was already
 
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
common practice up until recently
 
01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
and with that I asked the committee to
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
pass this bill with an aut path
 
01:36:56.209 --> 01:36:56.219 align:start position:0%
recommendation but I did add something
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
at the end that I did find a technical
 
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
error in this bill and I would be
 
01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
putting forth an amendment because it
 
01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
does not State who gets to decide when
 
01:37:07.729 --> 01:37:07.739 align:start position:0%
to increase the encrypt the police
 
01:37:10.729 --> 01:37:10.739 align:start position:0%
frequency so I would like to uh
 
01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
I wanted to hear what the committee uh
 
01:37:15.050 --> 01:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
had to say about that before I sent in
 
01:37:17.209 --> 01:37:17.219 align:start position:0%
an amendment thank you and I'll take any
 
01:37:17.219 --> 01:37:23.750 align:start position:0%
an amendment thank you and I'll take any
questions

01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:28.990 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:37:28.990 --> 01:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
you haven't introduced the amendment yet
 
01:37:34.970 --> 01:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
but uh who should decide who encrypts
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
the records and when
 
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh it was
 
01:37:40.729 --> 01:37:40.739 align:start position:0%
um my intention to uh make it the chief
 
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
of police or his designee uh and then
 
01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
make it so that there is a time limit on
 
01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
how long they can encrypt their
 
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
frequencies before having to go to a
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
judge to uh encrypt their frequency for
 
01:37:53.390 --> 01:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
any longer my intention with an
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
amendment would be probably uh anywhere
 
01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.410 align:start position:0%
amendment would be probably uh anywhere
from

01:37:57.410 --> 01:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:37:59.810 --> 01:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
48 hours to a week that they could
 
01:38:01.129 --> 01:38:01.139 align:start position:0%
increase this frequency because we don't
 
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
know how long these situations might
 
01:38:05.149 --> 01:38:05.159 align:start position:0%
last and then we would have to go to a
 
01:38:07.930 --> 01:38:07.940 align:start position:0%
judge to uh see if we need to continue
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:15.709 --> 01:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
representative testerman
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:38:21.169 --> 01:38:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:24.530 --> 01:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
originally at one time I guess you say
 
01:38:27.410 --> 01:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
all of the frequencies were were open
 
01:38:31.370 --> 01:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
and I know that to be true uh and now
 
01:38:32.930 --> 01:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
that they can't
 
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%
what harm is whether they're encrypted
 
01:38:46.010 --> 01:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
if they were to be open for uh and the
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
if we
 
01:38:54.169 --> 01:38:54.179 align:start position:0%
if we allowed them to be incredible all
 
01:38:54.179 --> 01:38:55.430 align:start position:0%
if we allowed them to be incredible all
encrypted

01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
encrypted
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
are partially encrypted or none I mean
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
what harm if they're all encrypted
 
01:39:06.110 --> 01:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
I believe that would be uh in violation
 
01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
of the people's rights to know what
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
their government is doing I believe it's
 
01:39:11.689 --> 01:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
a matter of public transparency on the
 
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
actions their governments are doing
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to uh law
 
01:39:18.530 --> 01:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
enforcement because uh they they do
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
serve the public and I believe it's the
 
01:39:22.729 --> 01:39:22.739 align:start position:0%
Public's right to know what uh what they
 
01:39:25.610 --> 01:39:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
representative Roy
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
um we've heard and seen uh recently in
 
01:39:37.250 --> 01:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
the last few years incidents of law
 
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement members being ambushed and
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
killed and part of that would be knowing
 
01:39:43.970 --> 01:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
where they are and where they're going
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
do you not feel that it's in the best
 
01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
interest in the safety of officers not
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
to have their exact locations always
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.250 --> 01:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
I believe those would be a extraordinary
 
01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:00.709 align:start position:0%
I believe those would be a extraordinary
circumstances

01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
um and I I would look into a way to
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative the chair May inquire of
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
a question is there any particular
 
01:40:15.110 --> 01:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
incident that occurred in the state of
 
01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that inspired this
 
01:40:18.770 --> 01:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
legislation or at least
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
raise this issue uh mostly discussions
 
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:28.610 --> 01:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you Rob
 
01:40:38.330 --> 01:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:41.590 align:start position:0%
 
ly

01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
fairness a question like that anyone
 
01:40:46.850 --> 01:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
this is a public hearing any one member
 
01:40:49.850 --> 01:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
of the public is allowed to testify to
 
01:40:51.770 --> 01:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
allow to answer speak on behalf of that
 
01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
many individuals I don't think is an
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate question can I clarify I'm
 
01:40:56.990 --> 01:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
going to rule that question out of order
 
01:40:58.490 --> 01:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
you may ask a different question I'd
 
01:41:01.790 --> 01:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
like to know a relative argument that
 
01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
has been a general consensus
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
and as you can speak into as few words
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
as possible as to what you're hearing
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing from my constituents is
 
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
that they have been able to listen to
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
police frequencies uh since forever uh
 
01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
and that this uh one Community uh Nashua
 
01:41:26.450 --> 01:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
is the only one to my knowledge that has
 
01:41:28.189 --> 01:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
decided to permanently encrypt their
 
01:41:30.290 --> 01:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
frequencies so that these individuals
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
can no longer listen to those
 
01:41:34.609 --> 01:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
Communications I know a good few of my
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
constituents listen to the Amherst
 
01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
Police Department uh police
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
Communications and there's no ill intent
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
there it's just good to know what is
 
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:52.010 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:41:52.010 --> 01:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:42:11.229 --> 01:42:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
Shannon recognizes representative
 
01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:16.790 align:start position:0%
Shannon recognizes representative
leightner

01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
so the record I'm a representative Stacy
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
Marie Lawton
 
01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
um I filed this legislation and I want
 
01:42:38.450 --> 01:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
to thank Tony for helping to introduce
 
01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:39.770 align:start position:0%
to thank Tony for helping to introduce
it

01:42:39.770 --> 01:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:42:41.930 --> 01:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
um and this
 
01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
is not a piece of legislation to
 
01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
um to come down on any sort of law
 
01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:49.970 align:start position:0%
um to come down on any sort of law
enforcement

01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
it is more to do with either
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
transparency or
 
01:42:59.590 --> 01:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
um it does these though controversially
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
they some people might feel that they
 
01:43:05.810 --> 01:43:05.820 align:start position:0%
should not be they should be encrypted
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
others you know this also helps folks
 
01:43:12.050 --> 01:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
that are like myself who cover community
 
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
events I do a fair amount of reporting
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
not today but um we do a lot of stuff in
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
Nashville and
 
01:43:24.970 --> 01:43:24.980 align:start position:0%
um using the uh the scanner frequencies
 
01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
helped us to
 
01:43:31.609 --> 01:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
um do our jobs a little better and
 
01:43:34.609 --> 01:43:34.619 align:start position:0%
um and I have received bipartisan
 
01:43:38.570 --> 01:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
support on this legislation and
 
01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:39.169 align:start position:0%
support on this legislation and
um

01:43:39.169 --> 01:43:39.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
you know as far as
 
01:43:44.990 --> 01:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know what's going on as far as you
 
01:43:46.850 --> 01:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
know why we wanted to file this and why
 
01:43:49.129 --> 01:43:49.139 align:start position:0%
I wanted to file it like I said there's
 
01:43:51.169 --> 01:43:51.179 align:start position:0%
nothing specifically against Nashville
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
Police Department we actually respect my
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
local police department a great deal and
 
01:43:58.490 --> 01:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
all police departments across the state
 
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
the idea for this was basically for the
 
01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
people's right to know what's going on
 
01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
in their police departments and also in
 
01:44:08.770 --> 01:44:08.780 align:start position:0%
different instances
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
these communications help people do
 
01:44:13.930 --> 01:44:13.940 align:start position:0%
their jobs whether it's hotel security
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
members of the press so they know what's
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
going on in the community it actually
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
impedes uh the job of some reporters in
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
the city of Nashua and this is something
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
that has been done in other communities
 
01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire but Nashua
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
currently is the only community in the
 
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
state that has encrypted its frequencies
 
01:44:36.239 --> 01:44:38.510 align:start position:0%
state that has encrypted its frequencies
and

01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
the legislation does state that uh
 
01:44:45.229 --> 01:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
it would own the
 
01:44:47.209 --> 01:44:47.219 align:start position:0%
we would encrypt frequencies when it
 
01:44:49.129 --> 01:44:49.139 align:start position:0%
comes to highly sensitive situations
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
such as you know if there's uh an active
 
01:44:55.850 --> 01:44:55.860 align:start position:0%
shooter situation something that's you
 
01:44:59.209 --> 01:44:59.219 align:start position:0%
know that needs to be confidential but
 
01:45:01.609 --> 01:45:01.619 align:start position:0%
these will be just basic
 
01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
um uh Communications you know and if
 
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think it really I've I've heard
 
01:45:11.450 --> 01:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
that it might
 
01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:12.709 align:start position:0%
that it might
um

01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:12.719 --> 01:45:14.750 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
it might cause a safety risk for police
 
01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
officers in the state
 
01:45:22.729 --> 01:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
it really hasn't
 
01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
um I I've noticed in other places it
 
01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
might but New Hampshire that hasn't
 
01:45:30.109 --> 01:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
really been an issue and Nashua didn't
 
01:45:32.810 --> 01:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
really have a reason to encrypt they
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
just did so and so
 
01:45:38.209 --> 01:45:38.219 align:start position:0%
um I I filed this because I feel as
 
01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
though um it's it's our right to know
 
01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
the citizens have a right to know and
 
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
um and it also like I said it it
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
prohibits people from being able to do
 
01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
their job
 
01:45:50.930 --> 01:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
and this is what only pertained to
 
01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:52.430 align:start position:0%
and this is what only pertained to
General

01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
General
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
um Communications you know highly
 
01:45:56.510 --> 01:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
sensitive stuff like I said would be
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
would have to remain encrypted because
 
01:46:00.649 --> 01:46:00.659 align:start position:0%
you know there's certain information the
 
01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:02.820 align:start position:0%
public doesn't need to know but just
 
01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:03.669 align:start position:0%
public doesn't need to know but just
general

01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
Communications that um
 
01:46:10.490 --> 01:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
that that they do every day and uh and
 
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
we're not looking to impede on officer
 
01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:13.970 align:start position:0%
we're not looking to impede on officer
safety

01:46:13.970 --> 01:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
um officer safety is very important but
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much all I have to say and
 
01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
I wanted to thank again uh
 
01:46:23.209 --> 01:46:23.219 align:start position:0%
representative labrench for helping me
 
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
in Manchester I can only speak for
 
01:46:43.609 --> 01:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
Manchester we have very clear
 
01:46:43.619 --> 01:46:45.229 align:start position:0%
Manchester we have very clear
communication

01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
communication
 
01:46:47.149 --> 01:46:47.159 align:start position:0%
um we don't we have encrypted
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
um frequencies but yet we are we have um
 
01:46:52.129 --> 01:46:52.139 align:start position:0%
like Facebook Twitter and all that stuff
 
01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
that actually lets us know what's
 
01:46:55.850 --> 01:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
happening so that's very clear
 
01:46:58.250 --> 01:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
um is that something that you think
 
01:47:00.830 --> 01:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
could be in place just because could you
 
01:47:02.930 --> 01:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
just repeat your question yeah do you
 
01:47:04.910 --> 01:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
think that that could be in place of
 
01:47:06.649 --> 01:47:06.659 align:start position:0%
encrypted frequencies instead just
 
01:47:06.659 --> 01:47:08.689 align:start position:0%
encrypted frequencies instead just
communication

01:47:08.689 --> 01:47:08.699 align:start position:0%
communication
 
01:47:11.629 --> 01:47:11.639 align:start position:0%
you mean to use like social media
 
01:47:13.609 --> 01:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
um I feel like that would be a good
 
01:47:16.250 --> 01:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
option if there was somebody dedicated
 
01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
to updating that information
 
01:47:21.410 --> 01:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
um not always is there someone readily
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
available to do that
 
01:47:26.689 --> 01:47:26.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
the chairman choir
 
01:47:31.729 --> 01:47:31.739 align:start position:0%
suppose this this
 
01:47:34.970 --> 01:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
Bill became law and
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
if you look at the lines three through
 
01:47:40.370 --> 01:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
seven of the bill
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
what would what do you believe the
 
01:47:43.609 --> 01:47:43.619 align:start position:0%
consequence should be if an officer
 
01:47:45.530 --> 01:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
didn't comply with that paragraph it
 
01:47:47.390 --> 01:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
seems to me that whatever would have
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
would that it was a contest if you can
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
test that issue or not it would have
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
already happened I guess so what
 
01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
what happens if that's not followed by
 
01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
um well I mean to say like if an officer
 
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
encrypted and they weren't supposed to
 
01:48:04.129 --> 01:48:04.139 align:start position:0%
encrypt under like if this became law it
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
didn't meet the definition
 
01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
um I guess it would probably I wouldn't
 
01:48:10.370 --> 01:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
think there should be any sort of
 
01:48:12.050 --> 01:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
penalties I mean maybe if they did it
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
and they weren't sure of
 
01:48:16.010 --> 01:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
if they were allowed to or if it
 
01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
qualified for encryption
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
um maybe just a supervisor talking to
 
01:48:23.570 --> 01:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
them but I don't think an officer should
 
01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:24.950 align:start position:0%
them but I don't think an officer should
be

01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
um you know reprimanded for you know for
 
01:48:30.530 --> 01:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
this I mean sometimes things are done in
 
01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:31.430 align:start position:0%
this I mean sometimes things are done in
Era

01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
Era
 
01:48:34.189 --> 01:48:34.199 align:start position:0%
um but uh I don't I don't think there
 
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
should be anything negative that should
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
happen to the officer
 
01:48:39.890 --> 01:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:42.770 --> 01:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
representative Conley
 
01:48:44.090 --> 01:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
taking the question have you asked your
 
01:48:49.129 --> 01:48:49.139 align:start position:0%
home department and your Chief to
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
explain their thought process for why
 
01:48:54.890 --> 01:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
they made this change I have
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
and um under the previous chief who's no
 
01:49:00.050 --> 01:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
longer the chief as of this past Sunday
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
he never returned my phone calls and
 
01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
after also trying to reach out to other
 
01:49:07.010 --> 01:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
people in the department I've I've
 
01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:15.169 --> 01:49:15.179 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
01:49:15.179 --> 01:49:21.770 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
testimony

01:49:21.770 --> 01:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:23.450 --> 01:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognizes Joseph
 
01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:31.669 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognizes Joseph
hobeki

01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.189 --> 01:49:34.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the committee my
 
01:49:36.490 --> 01:49:36.500 align:start position:0%
name is Joseph hobecki
 
01:49:39.050 --> 01:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
h-o-e-b-e-k-e for the record I'm the
 
01:49:40.609 --> 01:49:40.619 align:start position:0%
chief of police in Hollis New Hampshire
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
and I also serve as the current
 
01:49:43.850 --> 01:49:43.860 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire
 
01:49:46.570 --> 01:49:46.580 align:start position:0%
Association of chiefs of police
 
01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
in no deference to representative Lawton
 
01:49:52.430 --> 01:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
I respectfully asked this committee to
 
01:49:53.930 --> 01:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
find this bill and expedient to
 
01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:55.550 align:start position:0%
find this bill and expedient to
legislate

01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:49:58.010 --> 01:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
um I have a few points
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
um I find this fill this bill filled
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
with uh ambig ambiguity uh it's quite
 
01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:04.790 align:start position:0%
with uh ambig ambiguity uh it's quite
ambiguous

01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
ambiguous
 
01:50:07.010 --> 01:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
um it's confusing
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
um in reality
 
01:50:12.169 --> 01:50:12.179 align:start position:0%
um what we need to do as agencies is
 
01:50:14.930 --> 01:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
protect real-time information
 
01:50:17.689 --> 01:50:17.699 align:start position:0%
and with technology and social media
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
there is this constant flow of
 
01:50:22.910 --> 01:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
information to sources like the media
 
01:50:25.609 --> 01:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
that informs them of events as they're
 
01:50:28.609 --> 01:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
happening look in the newspaper turn on
 
01:50:30.770 --> 01:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
the news and you'll see that media
 
01:50:33.590 --> 01:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
sources have very real access real-time
 
01:50:36.590 --> 01:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
access to information as it's occurring
 
01:50:41.209 --> 01:50:41.219 align:start position:0%
encryption provides Public Safety with a
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
mechanism to protect certain information
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
and some of which is defined in the
 
01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
legislation and and some of which is not
 
01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
um when we look at specific instances
 
01:50:53.689 --> 01:50:53.699 align:start position:0%
maybe in New Hampshire this is not a
 
01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
problem yet it might be it wasn't a
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
problem in Boston until the Boston
 
01:51:01.070 --> 01:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
Marathon bombings when they were
 
01:51:02.810 --> 01:51:02.820 align:start position:0%
conveying information about potential
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
suspects over unencrypted channels and
 
01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
that information was then being
 
01:51:10.129 --> 01:51:10.139 align:start position:0%
redistributed by members of the public
 
01:51:12.410 --> 01:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
and it turns out that those persons
 
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
weren't Suspects
 
01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
um so there's a very real danger there
 
01:51:20.090 --> 01:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
um from my knowledge there's at least
 
01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
um two or three other agencies in the
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
state that use encrypted Networks
 
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative Bradley mentioned
 
01:51:29.689 --> 01:51:29.699 align:start position:0%
Manchester they also use encryption on
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
their radio system I know Nashua Nashua
 
01:51:33.950 --> 01:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
has used it for two years Manchester
 
01:51:36.669 --> 01:51:36.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester has used it for four years
 
01:51:40.609 --> 01:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
and in the interest of disseminating
 
01:51:43.010 --> 01:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
information into timely manner I know
 
01:51:45.770 --> 01:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
for example Nashua what they will do is
 
01:51:48.169 --> 01:51:48.179 align:start position:0%
they will communicate information on
 
01:51:51.169 --> 01:51:51.179 align:start position:0%
their website about specific calls even
 
01:51:53.330 --> 01:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
though Communications are encrypted on a
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
website that's available between 20 and
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
30 minutes after the call occurs
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
so that the argument that people don't
 
01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
have access that there's a lack of
 
01:52:07.129 --> 01:52:07.139 align:start position:0%
transparency I don't believe is an
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
accurate representation of what is
 
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
actually occurring I would also mention
 
01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
that to encrypt the radio system is
 
01:52:16.850 --> 01:52:16.860 align:start position:0%
quite expensive
 
01:52:18.530 --> 01:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
um and so what do we do if this bill
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
passes are we to say that these agencies
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
now have to unencrypt their radios which
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
requires money to do that it there's a
 
01:52:28.370 --> 01:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
cost that would require all these radios
 
01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
to be reprogrammed which in fact is is a
 
01:52:35.629 --> 01:52:35.639 align:start position:0%
you know comes down to funding and
 
01:52:37.490 --> 01:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
really is an unfunded mandate on these
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions to to then unencrypt their
 
01:52:42.649 --> 01:52:42.659 align:start position:0%
Radio Systems that have been in place uh
 
01:52:44.330 --> 01:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
for a number of years
 
01:52:46.609 --> 01:52:46.619 align:start position:0%
additionally I think we need to be very
 
01:52:50.090 --> 01:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
careful about eroding local control so
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
as a chief I don't operate in an agency
 
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
with encrypted channels if I had the
 
01:52:55.970 --> 01:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
money I would probably do that at least
 
01:52:58.609 --> 01:52:58.619 align:start position:0%
have one encrypted channel for sensitive
 
01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
information as it stands now I would
 
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
have to switch to a uh like a federal
 
01:53:06.169 --> 01:53:06.179 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security channel to have
 
01:53:06.179 --> 01:53:08.629 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security channel to have
interoperability

01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
interoperability
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
um but I think that as a chief of police
 
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
that decision should be my choice along
 
01:53:16.010 --> 01:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
with the governing body who are my
 
01:53:18.649 --> 01:53:18.659 align:start position:0%
bosses as you know so with that I ask
 
01:53:20.689 --> 01:53:20.699 align:start position:0%
you to find this bill and expedient to
 
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
legislate and I'll answer any questions
 
01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
that you may have
 
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes
 
01:53:27.950 --> 01:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
and Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:53:30.530 --> 01:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
question thank you we heard testimony
 
01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:32.470 align:start position:0%
question thank you we heard testimony
that

01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:34.090 align:start position:0%
that
encryption

01:53:34.090 --> 01:53:34.100 align:start position:0%
encryption
 
01:53:37.970 --> 01:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
hindered the media from being able to do
 
01:53:41.930 --> 01:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:44.570 --> 01:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding or is it true
 
01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
that you know if if local media
 
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
were to call a police station and ask
 
01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:53.270 align:start position:0%
were to call a police station and ask
questions

01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
that information is available right so
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
it really would have nothing to do with
 
01:53:59.290 --> 01:53:59.300 align:start position:0%
whether or not the information
 
01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
if you're if you were had encrypted
 
01:54:04.129 --> 01:54:04.139 align:start position:0%
information going over the radio
 
01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
that's correct and and again I think the
 
01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
intent of encryption
 
01:54:10.850 --> 01:54:10.860 align:start position:0%
in a world where technology is so
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
readily available I mean you can
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
download an app on your smart device
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
that allows you to scan unencrypted
 
01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
channels there was a problem with people
 
01:54:21.229 --> 01:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
showing up to calls before police
 
01:54:23.629 --> 01:54:23.639 align:start position:0%
arrived on scene and I'm not saying that
 
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
happens in every jurisdiction but
 
01:54:27.770 --> 01:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
certainly that was a consideration in
 
01:54:29.810 --> 01:54:29.820 align:start position:0%
terms of radio encryption additionally
 
01:54:31.609 --> 01:54:31.619 align:start position:0%
we have to look at it's not just law
 
01:54:34.490 --> 01:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
enforcement that has information that
 
01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
might necessarily require protection
 
01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
think about fire service right do they
 
01:54:43.010 --> 01:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
not have information that they could
 
01:54:44.810 --> 01:54:44.820 align:start position:0%
communicate to their dispatch centers
 
01:54:48.530 --> 01:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
that might be protected Say by HIPAA so
 
01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
I think those are additional
 
01:54:52.129 --> 01:54:52.139 align:start position:0%
considerations but I do believe that
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
the public has access to this
 
01:54:56.810 --> 01:54:56.820 align:start position:0%
information the media has access to this
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
information to me this is a non-issue
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
and and I don't think we need to do this
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
I just don't see the intent and the
 
01:55:05.209 --> 01:55:05.219 align:start position:0%
purpose of the legislation
 
01:55:09.649 --> 01:55:09.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:12.169 --> 01:55:12.179 align:start position:0%
representative Borden you're recognized
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you I'm a
 
01:55:18.290 --> 01:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
little concerned if if the police
 
01:55:21.410 --> 01:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
encrypt their Communications how do they
 
01:55:24.290 --> 01:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
coordinate with Eminence and fire
 
01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:26.629 align:start position:0%
coordinate with Eminence and fire
departments

01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
departments
 
01:55:29.149 --> 01:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
well typically with encrypted
 
01:55:31.609 --> 01:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
um radio communications the jurisdiction
 
01:55:33.169 --> 01:55:33.179 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
um would would also have the capability
 
01:55:37.850 --> 01:55:37.860 align:start position:0%
for interoperability with encrypted
 
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:40.679 align:start position:0%
channels save if a police department in
 
01:55:42.890 --> 01:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
Hollis decides to have an encrypted
 
01:55:46.609 --> 01:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
radio system we would be ensure that
 
01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
um fire and EMS and even DPW would have
 
01:55:53.209 --> 01:55:53.219 align:start position:0%
the capability to interoper for
 
01:55:55.970 --> 01:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
interoperability with our agencies in
 
01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:57.060 align:start position:0%
addition to that when we're talking
 
01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
about outside jurisdictions there are
 
01:56:02.209 --> 01:56:02.219 align:start position:0%
means in in ways to do that through
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
different radio channels that are common
 
01:56:08.570 --> 01:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
use not encrypted like the vtac channels
 
01:56:11.450 --> 01:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
the v-law channels as well as through
 
01:56:13.250 --> 01:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
dispatch centers to communicate
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
information as well
 
01:56:17.629 --> 01:56:17.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:56:20.090 --> 01:56:20.100 align:start position:0%
representative Newman you're recognized
 
01:56:22.189 --> 01:56:22.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:56:22.199 --> 01:56:23.570 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

01:56:23.570 --> 01:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
um and Hollis are your Communications
 
01:56:29.290 --> 01:56:29.300 align:start position:0%
encrypted and if not how do you handle
 
01:56:31.850 --> 01:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
situations where you need to encrypt
 
01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:33.770 align:start position:0%
situations where you need to encrypt
information

01:56:33.770 --> 01:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
representative so we are not and it's
 
01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
certainly it's costly to do it we've
 
01:56:42.530 --> 01:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
talked about it it's just the funding
 
01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:43.609 align:start position:0%
talked about it it's just the funding
source

01:56:43.609 --> 01:56:43.619 align:start position:0%
source
 
01:56:45.950 --> 01:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
to find the appropriate funding to do it
 
01:56:48.709 --> 01:56:48.719 align:start position:0%
in a responsible manner how we would do
 
01:56:50.209 --> 01:56:50.219 align:start position:0%
that in terms of sensitive information
 
01:56:50.219 --> 01:56:51.350 align:start position:0%
that in terms of sensitive information
is

01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
we would do our best obviously not to
 
01:56:54.890 --> 01:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
communicate that information over the
 
01:56:58.250 --> 01:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
Airways we could try and use other means
 
01:57:01.609 --> 01:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
such as mobile data Terminals and cars
 
01:57:04.250 --> 01:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
um we we urge the officers not to use
 
01:57:06.590 --> 01:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
their personal cell phone devices just
 
01:57:08.270 --> 01:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
because they are discoverable in many
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
cases and you know we don't want that
 
01:57:12.290 --> 01:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
information there you them using their
 
01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
personal cell phone devices to
 
01:57:15.910 --> 01:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
communicate police related matters
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%
slippery slope
 
01:57:21.290 --> 01:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
um so we try our best to handle that
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
appropriately uh and to protect privacy
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
and tactics and such but the reality is
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
is in these rapidly evolving situations
 
01:57:32.270 --> 01:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
we may not necessarily have that option
 
01:57:34.729 --> 01:57:34.739 align:start position:0%
there might be specific information that
 
01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
needs to be communicated the officer
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
might not be near their car they may not
 
01:57:40.490 --> 01:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
have the ability to communicate in some
 
01:57:43.550 --> 01:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
alternative uh medium and so they have
 
01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.729 --> 01:57:55.739 align:start position:0%
not understanding how many channels you
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
have access to and things like that the
 
01:58:01.330 --> 01:58:01.340 align:start position:0%
technical capabilities that you have
 
01:58:04.189 --> 01:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
would would with that the kind of
 
01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:05.639 align:start position:0%
capabilities that you may have or other
 
01:58:07.129 --> 01:58:07.139 align:start position:0%
police departments may have could you
 
01:58:09.410 --> 01:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
have one frequency that was not
 
01:58:11.089 --> 01:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
encrypted for your general calls and
 
01:58:12.890 --> 01:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
then when you needed in to encrypt
 
01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:14.149 align:start position:0%
then when you needed in to encrypt
something

01:58:14.149 --> 01:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:58:16.250 --> 01:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
could you then go to your encrypted
 
01:58:19.729 --> 01:58:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.490 --> 01:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
yes short answer yes so in our previous
 
01:58:25.010 --> 01:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
lifetime at my previous Department we
 
01:58:26.770 --> 01:58:26.780 align:start position:0%
had that so we had an encrypted Channel
 
01:58:29.810 --> 01:58:29.820 align:start position:0%
but again it is cost prohibitive it's
 
01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
very expensive
 
01:58:33.970 --> 01:58:33.980 align:start position:0%
um and then it's not just the cost to
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
have a encrypted Channel
 
01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:38.350 align:start position:0%
have a encrypted Channel
um

01:58:38.350 --> 01:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
frequency it's the cost uh program all
 
01:58:44.330 --> 01:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
the radio it's portable radios dispatch
 
01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
radios mobile radios which are in the
 
01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:48.709 align:start position:0%
radios mobile radios which are in the
Cruisers

01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
Cruisers
 
01:58:48.719 --> 01:58:52.310 align:start position:0%
Cruisers
foreign

01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:55.310 --> 01:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative Bert you were recognized
 
01:58:57.229 --> 01:58:57.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:58:58.850 --> 01:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
um I heard a word that made my ears fly
 
01:59:03.649 --> 01:59:03.659 align:start position:0%
up about
 
01:59:03.659 --> 01:59:06.649 align:start position:0%
up about
um

01:59:06.649 --> 01:59:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:08.689 --> 01:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
uh HIPAA
 
01:59:11.149 --> 01:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
some situations are in HIPAA could you
 
01:59:11.159 --> 01:59:12.770 align:start position:0%
some situations are in HIPAA could you
explain

01:59:12.770 --> 01:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
explain
 
01:59:16.609 --> 01:59:16.619 align:start position:0%
who is responsible
 
01:59:20.570 --> 01:59:20.580 align:start position:0%
for keeping HIPAA information private
 
01:59:24.169 --> 01:59:24.179 align:start position:0%
and who is not responsible in a public
 
01:59:24.179 --> 01:59:27.169 align:start position:0%
and who is not responsible in a public
setting

01:59:27.169 --> 01:59:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
well I think we all have a
 
01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility to keep you know medical
 
01:59:32.689 --> 01:59:32.699 align:start position:0%
information private I I used it in
 
01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
context of the fire service in speaking
 
01:59:37.490 --> 01:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
with some folks about encryption
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
I know that's a very real concern for
 
01:59:43.129 --> 01:59:43.139 align:start position:0%
the fire uh in EMS side of of the house
 
01:59:43.139 --> 01:59:44.149 align:start position:0%
the fire uh in EMS side of of the house
and

01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:44.159 --> 01:59:44.810 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
and they're very concerned about having
 
01:59:49.609 --> 01:59:49.619 align:start position:0%
to put information out via the radio if
 
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
they may not have access to one of those
 
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
alternative mediums like I spoke to so
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
that was one of the things that I spoke
 
02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
I when I had a conversation with kind of
 
02:00:03.169 --> 02:00:03.179 align:start position:0%
a technical expert in this area which
 
02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
clearly I am not um he mentioned that
 
02:00:07.490 --> 02:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
that there was concerns for hipper
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
particularly from the Fire EMS side and
 
02:00:10.689 --> 02:00:10.699 align:start position:0%
I hope I answered your question
 
02:00:13.010 --> 02:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
representative all right thank you thank
 
02:00:13.020 --> 02:00:18.589 align:start position:0%
representative all right thank you thank
you

02:00:18.589 --> 02:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
02:00:29.089 --> 02:00:29.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and uh thank you
 
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
Chief Becky for taking my question
 
02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
can you give me an idea how if a town or
 
02:00:37.490 --> 02:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
city had encrypted and not encrypted
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
radios would it just be a like a two two
 
02:00:45.530 --> 02:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
button issue over they change to a
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:49.850 --> 02:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
from my understanding the bands would
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
stay the same it's just an encrypted
 
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
Channel Through the programming of the
 
02:00:55.609 --> 02:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
radio so it would depend on what radio
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
systems being used
 
02:00:59.330 --> 02:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
I would imagine for a portable radio
 
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
from my experience when we operated with
 
02:01:03.890 --> 02:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
an encrypted Channel it you basically
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
turned the dial to try and find the
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
encrypted Channel
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
mobile radios in the car same situation
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
just maybe a different button
 
02:01:14.209 --> 02:01:14.219 align:start position:0%
uh Dispatch they would have to find the
 
02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate frequency for encryption on
 
02:01:17.629 --> 02:01:17.639 align:start position:0%
their radio system but typically when
 
02:01:19.510 --> 02:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
you switch to an encrypted Channel
 
02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
dispatch really doesn't need to do
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
anything from there into the house other
 
02:01:25.310 --> 02:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
than listen to the transmission coming
 
02:01:27.649 --> 02:01:27.659 align:start position:0%
to the station
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:33.109 --> 02:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you chief for your testimony thank
 
02:01:33.119 --> 02:01:35.629 align:start position:0%
thank you chief for your testimony thank
you

02:01:35.629 --> 02:01:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:37.970 --> 02:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
this time the chair recognizes
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
hi good morning members of the committee
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
chairman uh it's good to be back before
 
02:01:57.070 --> 02:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
you in person my name is Joe Ebert it's
 
02:01:59.629 --> 02:01:59.639 align:start position:0%
eb-e-r-t and I'm a captain with the
 
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
state police I oversee the Investigative
 
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
Services Bureau which is the detectives
 
02:02:06.290 --> 02:02:06.300 align:start position:0%
within the agency
 
02:02:08.810 --> 02:02:08.820 align:start position:0%
so I am here today to oppose this bill
 
02:02:11.629 --> 02:02:11.639 align:start position:0%
uh I won't go over the points that Chief
 
02:02:14.270 --> 02:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
obecki has brought up but I did want to
 
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
emphasize a few things I think there I
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
was hoping to thank the sponsor of the
 
02:02:20.450 --> 02:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
bill because I do think that there was
 
02:02:22.490 --> 02:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
an effort made to really take into
 
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
consideration the safety of law
 
02:02:26.930 --> 02:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
enforcement here I I just in our opinion
 
02:02:28.189 --> 02:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
it fell short
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
um there is a
 
02:02:32.330 --> 02:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
there is the ability to switch
 
02:02:35.089 --> 02:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
Communications to encrypt it as I think
 
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
was just the discussion that was being
 
02:02:39.649 --> 02:02:39.659 align:start position:0%
had our concern with that is that
 
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
situations unfold so rapidly that it it
 
02:02:47.689 --> 02:02:47.699 align:start position:0%
is difficult to either make an incumbent
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
upon the trooper or the officer or the
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
deputy who's in that uh rapidly
 
02:02:54.050 --> 02:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
unfolding uh situation to switch over to
 
02:02:55.370 --> 02:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
an encrypted Channel
 
02:02:58.609 --> 02:02:58.619 align:start position:0%
or to ask somebody who's in dispatch who
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
may be receiving 911 phone calls about
 
02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:01.860 align:start position:0%
it trying to dispatch emergency
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
Personnel other than law enforcement uh
 
02:03:06.770 --> 02:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
to a scene and trying to hear the law
 
02:03:09.229 --> 02:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh traffic it's it's a lot
 
02:03:11.689 --> 02:03:11.699 align:start position:0%
to ask for that in that moment to say
 
02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
okay where and I also want you to switch
 
02:03:15.770 --> 02:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
to the encrypted Channel
 
02:03:18.649 --> 02:03:18.659 align:start position:0%
the other concern that I have uh on
 
02:03:21.649 --> 02:03:21.659 align:start position:0%
behalf of the division is that uh the uh
 
02:03:23.089 --> 02:03:23.099 align:start position:0%
the notion that
 
02:03:23.099 --> 02:03:24.410 align:start position:0%
the notion that
um

02:03:24.410 --> 02:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:26.689 --> 02:03:26.699 align:start position:0%
all law enforcement agencies within the
 
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
the state would have to have an
 
02:03:29.930 --> 02:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
encrypted channel is concerning only
 
02:03:31.550 --> 02:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
because I'm not sure how that would be
 
02:03:34.129 --> 02:03:34.139 align:start position:0%
applicable to our federal Partners many
 
02:03:36.109 --> 02:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
of whom have encrypted uh frequencies
 
02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
that they operate on so you know I I
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
think that uh uh the last point I want
 
02:03:44.330 --> 02:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
to make is you
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
you can't always be sure uh one of the
 
02:03:49.370 --> 02:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
prior speakers said well we we just want
 
02:03:50.930 --> 02:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
to hear kind of the mundane things we
 
02:03:53.330 --> 02:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
want to hear what's going on uh in the
 
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
day-to-day things we're not looking for
 
02:03:57.709 --> 02:03:57.719 align:start position:0%
what is the significant action that's
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
taking place the problem is that you
 
02:04:01.850 --> 02:04:01.860 align:start position:0%
don't always know what that significant
 
02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
action is going to be something as
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
simple as being dispatched to uh
 
02:04:07.729 --> 02:04:07.739 align:start position:0%
domestic disturbance call when you're
 
02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
when you're signing off there that can
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
be an indicator to somebody on the
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
inside that you're there and and they
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
can take preparation and what to do uh
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
based on that so ideally uh to be able
 
02:04:20.209 --> 02:04:20.219 align:start position:0%
to have the option to encrypt your
 
02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
channel and have an encrypted
 
02:04:23.810 --> 02:04:23.820 align:start position:0%
communication for safety purposes is
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
something that we would absolutely
 
02:04:28.250 --> 02:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
support uh and and as a result of that
 
02:04:30.530 --> 02:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
we would oppose this bill having said
 
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
all that I am more than willing to take
 
02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt
 
02:04:40.129 --> 02:04:40.139 align:start position:0%
owner Federal agency comes into your
 
02:04:41.689 --> 02:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
area and they're encrypted doesn't that
 
02:04:43.370 --> 02:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
leave you at a disadvantage to try to
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
not be able to hear what they're doing
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
sure so uh yeah that's a 100 true that
 
02:04:52.370 --> 02:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
um if there is an agency that you're
 
02:04:53.629 --> 02:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
working with that has an encrypted
 
02:04:56.089 --> 02:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
Channel it makes it difficult uh we have
 
02:04:57.950 --> 02:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
a workaround for that to work off of
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
frequencies that are non-encrypted but
 
02:05:03.050 --> 02:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
that's really not ideal uh ideally what
 
02:05:04.850 --> 02:05:04.860 align:start position:0%
would uh what you would have and I think
 
02:05:08.089 --> 02:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
Chief hobecki referred to this is uh you
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
would have everyone have the ability to
 
02:05:11.810 --> 02:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
have the encrypted law enforcement
 
02:05:13.790 --> 02:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
Communications unfortunately that's very
 
02:05:15.950 --> 02:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
cost prohibitive but yes that's that's
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely something that um you know I
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
weighed out in terms of our support or
 
02:05:23.870 --> 02:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
not support of this bill but it's to me
 
02:05:26.470 --> 02:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
the uh the notion that you may have
 
02:05:28.430 --> 02:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
interoperability or inner communication
 
02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
that is somewhat hindered uh is
 
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
outweighed by the officer safety issue
 
02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
involved with the bill what up
 
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a follow-up okay
 
02:05:40.490 --> 02:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the 911 Commission
 
02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh study of the 9-1-1 situation where
 
02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
none of the organizations are able to
 
02:05:47.089 --> 02:05:47.099 align:start position:0%
talk to each other and that's the reason
 
02:05:49.070 --> 02:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
for the federal mandate to come up with
 
02:05:51.050 --> 02:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
all the money for all the radios that
 
02:05:53.209 --> 02:05:53.219 align:start position:0%
you all have now so you can talk to each
 
02:05:53.219 --> 02:05:53.870 align:start position:0%
you all have now so you can talk to each
other

02:05:53.870 --> 02:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:05:55.609 --> 02:05:55.619 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the uh the question sir
 
02:05:58.070 --> 02:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
and I what I can say is uh I don't want
 
02:05:59.390 --> 02:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
to come across as saying hey I'm an
 
02:06:01.070 --> 02:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
expert on that that was an incredibly
 
02:06:03.470 --> 02:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
large document uh what I can say is I'm
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with the notion that there were
 
02:06:07.970 --> 02:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
interoperability uh issues with that and
 
02:06:09.950 --> 02:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
it's something we struggle with uh and
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's there's no doubt that that's a
 
02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
real concern I don't want to uh Fufu
 
02:06:15.530 --> 02:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
that and uh come across to the committee
 
02:06:17.149 --> 02:06:17.159 align:start position:0%
that I don't think that inner
 
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
communication or inter-department
 
02:06:21.229 --> 02:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
communication isn't an issue I'm just
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
saying from my perspective and from the
 
02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
division of State Police perspective uh
 
02:06:28.189 --> 02:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
a a competing harm is that uh giving up
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
the position of law enforcement uh is
 
02:06:34.209 --> 02:06:34.219 align:start position:0%
also a of Paramount concern
 
02:06:36.050 --> 02:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
one more time
 
02:06:38.330 --> 02:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh tax channels you have multiple tax
 
02:06:39.770 --> 02:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
channels is it possible to have one
 
02:06:42.410 --> 02:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
channel for a bad situation and regular
 
02:06:43.850 --> 02:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
channels for your regular day operation
 
02:06:46.910 --> 02:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
I I so yes uh thank you for that
 
02:06:48.050 --> 02:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
question sir
 
02:06:50.570 --> 02:06:50.580 align:start position:0%
do I think that's possible yes uh I
 
02:06:53.330 --> 02:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
think that's uh cost prohibitive uh
 
02:06:54.649 --> 02:06:54.659 align:start position:0%
there's there's no doubt about it that
 
02:06:56.209 --> 02:06:56.219 align:start position:0%
that would be difficult for many
 
02:06:57.649 --> 02:06:57.659 align:start position:0%
agencies throughout the state I think
 
02:06:59.270 --> 02:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's probably something better for the
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
the Chiefs to speak on than necessarily
 
02:07:01.199 --> 02:07:02.330 align:start position:0%
the Chiefs to speak on than necessarily
me

02:07:02.330 --> 02:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:07:05.089 --> 02:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
um do I have uh could we have that
 
02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
capability yes we actually have we do
 
02:07:08.930 --> 02:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
have an encrypted channel that we could
 
02:07:09.950 --> 02:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
go to
 
02:07:13.129 --> 02:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
I just can't express you enough the
 
02:07:15.470 --> 02:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
rapid nature of which a call changes
 
02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:16.190 align:start position:0%
rapid nature of which a call changes
from

02:07:16.190 --> 02:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:17.390 align:start position:0%
from
[Music]

02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:07:19.609 --> 02:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
um somewhat mundane to an emergency
 
02:07:22.729 --> 02:07:22.739 align:start position:0%
situation and asking somebody to do
 
02:07:24.910 --> 02:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
something in that moment of pure stress
 
02:07:28.250 --> 02:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh like uh switch over on their portable
 
02:07:30.770 --> 02:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
or switch over on their their car radio
 
02:07:34.430 --> 02:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
I I believe is is asking too much of
 
02:07:36.530 --> 02:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
that individual who's who really should
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
be concentrated on uh the danger that's
 
02:07:41.149 --> 02:07:41.159 align:start position:0%
presented to them just one last question
 
02:07:44.030 --> 02:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh is State Police presently on
 
02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:47.030 align:start position:0%
uh is State Police presently on
narrowband

02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:49.310 --> 02:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately sir that is not a
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
question that I'm uh capable of uh
 
02:07:54.050 --> 02:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
answering however if that is something
 
02:07:55.550 --> 02:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
you're truly interested in I can get you
 
02:07:56.510 --> 02:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
that answer
 
02:07:58.850 --> 02:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
okay I believe that uh most State Police
 
02:08:00.709 --> 02:08:00.719 align:start position:0%
are now on narrow ban in digital
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
frequency and that's very difficult to
 
02:08:05.450 --> 02:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
scan with a scanner so these people that
 
02:08:06.530 --> 02:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
just want to listen to what you're doing
 
02:08:08.209 --> 02:08:08.219 align:start position:0%
or even a criminal is very difficult
 
02:08:09.890 --> 02:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
unless they pay an expensive radio buy
 
02:08:11.930 --> 02:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
an expensive radio like the ones you use
 
02:08:13.729 --> 02:08:13.739 align:start position:0%
understood so it's hard to scan yeah
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's hard to listen to none of your
 
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:16.070 align:start position:0%
it's hard to listen to none of your
business

02:08:16.070 --> 02:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:26.810 --> 02:08:26.820 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:31.370 --> 02:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
I I just want to understand when you
 
02:08:33.129 --> 02:08:33.139 align:start position:0%
talked about State Police having
 
02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
encrypted channels and non-encrypted
 
02:08:39.410 --> 02:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
channels could you just explain what you
 
02:08:42.109 --> 02:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
use each one of those four currently so
 
02:08:44.689 --> 02:08:44.699 align:start position:0%
I could just have understanding about
 
02:08:46.850 --> 02:08:46.860 align:start position:0%
what what you all do
 
02:08:48.649 --> 02:08:48.659 align:start position:0%
sure I
 
02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
absolutely so the uh as I was getting
 
02:08:53.689 --> 02:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
ready in prep for this uh hearing today
 
02:08:56.030 --> 02:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
I wanted to know uh well I assumed the
 
02:08:57.169 --> 02:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
first question that somebody might ask
 
02:08:59.149 --> 02:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
me is what does the State Police operate
 
02:09:01.609 --> 02:09:01.619 align:start position:0%
on an encrypted frequency what we have
 
02:09:04.850 --> 02:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
now is uh what was it presented to me is
 
02:09:07.790 --> 02:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
less than ideal in terms of our primary
 
02:09:10.550 --> 02:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
channel can be encrypted but it takes
 
02:09:12.350 --> 02:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
several steps with which to encrypt that
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
communication and that's why I really
 
02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to emphasize the notion that in a
 
02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
scenario where you have seconds to deal
 
02:09:21.169 --> 02:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
with something
 
02:09:23.089 --> 02:09:23.099 align:start position:0%
um you're it's asking a tremendous
 
02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
amount to ask at that moment that you
 
02:09:27.169 --> 02:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
also manipulate your radio to an
 
02:09:29.629 --> 02:09:29.639 align:start position:0%
encrypted fashion in terms of actual
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
channels there primarily encrypted that
 
02:09:33.530 --> 02:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of we have one primarily
 
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
encrypted Channel and that is used by
 
02:09:38.990 --> 02:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:43.129 --> 02:09:43.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:45.290 --> 02:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony excellent
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:53.390 --> 02:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
and this time we will now close the
 
02:10:37.669 --> 02:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:43.790 --> 02:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:44.049 --> 02:16:44.059 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:46.730 --> 02:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
at this time we will now open the public
 
02:16:49.730 --> 02:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 16
 
02:16:49.740 --> 02:16:52.190 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 16
82

02:16:52.190 --> 02:16:52.200 align:start position:0%

02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:54.240 align:start position:0%

and and before the before the
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative Begins for the members on
 
02:17:11.330 --> 02:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm gonna excise my
 
02:17:13.730 --> 02:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
discretion and limit each member to two
 
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:22.849 --> 02:17:22.859 align:start position:0%
representative you may begin
 
02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
all right for the record on
 
02:17:26.570 --> 02:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
representative David Welch I represent
 
02:17:29.389 --> 02:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 13.
 
02:17:32.750 --> 02:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
to give you just a brief introduction to
 
02:17:34.129 --> 02:17:34.139 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
uh I was asked by the speaker to sit on
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
a commission as prepared to Lee act
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
commission that was put together
 
02:17:45.169 --> 02:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
earlier on House Bill 2 created this
 
02:17:45.179 --> 02:17:46.549 align:start position:0%
earlier on House Bill 2 created this
Commission

02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
02:17:49.669 --> 02:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
it was a commission to develop
 
02:17:55.310 --> 02:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations for legislation to
 
02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
establish a single neutral and
 
02:18:00.110 --> 02:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
independent Statewide identity to
 
02:18:02.389 --> 02:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
receive complaints alleging misconduct
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
regarding all sworn and elected law
 
02:18:06.669 --> 02:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers
 
02:18:10.250 --> 02:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
pursuant the recommendation number 16 in
 
02:18:12.110 --> 02:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
the final report issued by the New
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Commission on law enforcement
 
02:18:16.190 --> 02:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
accountability community and
 
02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:18.709 align:start position:0%
accountability community and
transparency

02:18:18.709 --> 02:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
02:18:20.690 --> 02:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
the members of the commission are here
 
02:18:23.509 --> 02:18:23.519 align:start position:0%
they know the details so I would rather
 
02:18:23.519 --> 02:18:24.530 align:start position:0%
they know the details so I would rather
not

02:18:24.530 --> 02:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:18:27.169 --> 02:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
bore you with my interpretation of what
 
02:18:29.150 --> 02:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
I did on that commission I basically sat
 
02:18:31.610 --> 02:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
and listened
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
the only other elected member on that
 
02:18:37.370 --> 02:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
commission was Senator Carson
 
02:18:40.669 --> 02:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
and she elected so far as I know not to
 
02:18:43.730 --> 02:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
file legislation so I filed it
 
02:18:47.450 --> 02:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
and with that I have a uh the final
 
02:18:50.750 --> 02:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
report which I'll turn into the clerk
 
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
and I would defer any questions to The
 
02:18:56.870 --> 02:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:11.150 --> 02:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:13.009 --> 02:19:13.019 align:start position:0%
this time the chair now recognizes Eddie
 
02:19:13.019 --> 02:19:26.410 align:start position:0%
this time the chair now recognizes Eddie
Edwards

02:19:26.410 --> 02:19:26.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
it's been a moment for me
 
02:19:34.849 --> 02:19:34.859 align:start position:0%
so uh good morning chairman honorable
 
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
committee members if I could reserve my
 
02:19:40.370 --> 02:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
testimony to after director John skipper
 
02:19:41.629 --> 02:19:41.639 align:start position:0%
is the director of the police academy
 
02:19:43.129 --> 02:19:43.139 align:start position:0%
we'll kind of walk you through the
 
02:19:46.969 --> 02:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
entire piece of legislation that's fine
 
02:19:46.979 --> 02:19:58.429 align:start position:0%
entire piece of legislation that's fine
thank you

02:19:58.429 --> 02:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:59.870 --> 02:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try with the pronunciation
 
02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:00.830 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try with the pronunciation
here

02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:20:06.710 --> 02:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:16.490 --> 02:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:16.500 --> 02:20:17.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
good morning chair my name is Anthony
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
skullenbriti I'm here on behalf of nhaj
 
02:20:24.110 --> 02:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
I'm a lawyer I own my own firm with a
 
02:20:26.510 --> 02:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
former prosecutor in Nashua at Gillen
 
02:20:29.330 --> 02:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
scholombrini first of all I want to say
 
02:20:32.570 --> 02:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
that NHA supports this bill
 
02:20:33.889 --> 02:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
because we believe that everybody
 
02:20:36.349 --> 02:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
deserves due process
 
02:20:39.469 --> 02:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
the bill gives rise to a committee that
 
02:20:41.090 --> 02:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
or a council that would
 
02:20:43.250 --> 02:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
provide officers accused of Ron doing
 
02:20:45.429 --> 02:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
due process and it would also give
 
02:20:48.110 --> 02:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
victims of police misconduct recourse
 
02:20:51.050 --> 02:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
finally and importantly if the bill is
 
02:20:53.090 --> 02:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
made into law it would create a resource
 
02:20:54.410 --> 02:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
that would Aid both plaintiffs and
 
02:20:55.670 --> 02:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
defendants and cases involving
 
02:20:55.680 --> 02:20:57.230 align:start position:0%
defendants and cases involving
misconduct

02:20:57.230 --> 02:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
misconduct
 
02:20:59.570 --> 02:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
helping to preclude frivolous lawsuits
 
02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
and ensure that ligands are dealing with
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
what real well-vetted information
 
02:21:07.610 --> 02:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
while 1983 claims are a small part of
 
02:21:10.130 --> 02:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
what my firm does in 1983 is just this
 
02:21:12.290 --> 02:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
federal statute that allows people
 
02:21:15.290 --> 02:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
to sue in court for police uh misconduct
 
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
they are by far the most common intake
 
02:21:20.570 --> 02:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
topic that we have most of the people
 
02:21:23.570 --> 02:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
feel aggrieved by police misconduct and
 
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
strongly believe that something illegal
 
02:21:26.210 --> 02:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
has happened
 
02:21:28.670 --> 02:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
as it stands now researching prior
 
02:21:30.349 --> 02:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
conduct of officers is limited to
 
02:21:33.469 --> 02:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
unreliable sources lawsuits filed in
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
court but settled out of court the EES
 
02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
or what's called Lori list and internet
 
02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
sources when a person calls about the
 
02:21:42.469 --> 02:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
case one of the first things that I do
 
02:21:44.990 --> 02:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
is research about the officers involved
 
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
I've been a lawyer in New Hampshire for
 
02:21:49.190 --> 02:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
almost 20 years and I've been mostly a
 
02:21:51.710 --> 02:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
criminal defense lawyer so oftentimes I
 
02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
know the police officers by name
 
02:21:56.090 --> 02:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
uh but sometimes they don't and when it
 
02:21:57.889 --> 02:21:57.899 align:start position:0%
comes to finding information out about
 
02:22:00.650 --> 02:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
what happened it's very difficult a case
 
02:22:02.450 --> 02:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
that I had recently proves this point
 
02:22:06.170 --> 02:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
and why this Council would be helpful we
 
02:22:08.450 --> 02:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
had a case involving an officer who was
 
02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
arrested and the arrest was reported but
 
02:22:13.010 --> 02:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
the conclusion of the case just sort of
 
02:22:15.349 --> 02:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
disappeared Into The Ether and so the
 
02:22:18.050 --> 02:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
police log was appeared on the internet
 
02:22:19.490 --> 02:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
and we were able to find out that he was
 
02:22:22.370 --> 02:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
arrested but nothing else and so I have
 
02:22:24.410 --> 02:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
a duty to my client to use this
 
02:22:26.570 --> 02:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
information to their advantage and the
 
02:22:28.010 --> 02:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
other side had a duty to sort of
 
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
mitigate that information when we
 
02:22:31.849 --> 02:22:31.859 align:start position:0%
presented it to the judge because there
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
was no well-vetted facts there was no
 
02:22:35.990 --> 02:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
conclusion the judge had a hard time
 
02:22:38.570 --> 02:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
figuring out what to do and if this com
 
02:22:40.849 --> 02:22:40.859 align:start position:0%
this Council exists and the bill is made
 
02:22:42.110 --> 02:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
into law
 
02:22:44.210 --> 02:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
everyone would be playing with the same
 
02:22:46.670 --> 02:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
information we'd all have the same cards
 
02:22:48.889 --> 02:22:48.899 align:start position:0%
to go from when we're playing poker it
 
02:22:50.510 --> 02:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be you know one person using a
 
02:22:51.889 --> 02:22:51.899 align:start position:0%
regular deck of cards and somebody else
 
02:22:54.110 --> 02:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
using an Uno deck and that's really what
 
02:22:57.070 --> 02:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
it is right now we just don't have
 
02:22:59.570 --> 02:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
well-vetted information about police
 
02:23:02.809 --> 02:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
misconduct and we don't have
 
02:23:05.030 --> 02:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
conclusions about what happens a lot of
 
02:23:07.670 --> 02:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
the time and so that's important the one
 
02:23:08.990 --> 02:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
thing that I would point out is that
 
02:23:10.490 --> 02:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
there are two tweaks that we would like
 
02:23:12.830 --> 02:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
to see the first involves the
 
02:23:14.510 --> 02:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
transparency provisions and that
 
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
involves when the allegations are
 
02:23:18.590 --> 02:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
disclosed to the public
 
02:23:20.929 --> 02:23:20.939 align:start position:0%
under the law is currently written it
 
02:23:22.490 --> 02:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
would not be disclosed until the time of
 
02:23:24.889 --> 02:23:24.899 align:start position:0%
the hearing and we would like to see the
 
02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
disclosure time push back to when the
 
02:23:30.650 --> 02:23:30.660 align:start position:0%
charges are docketed we'd like to see
 
02:23:32.270 --> 02:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
this for two reasons number one it
 
02:23:35.150 --> 02:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
parallels the ethics rules that exist
 
02:23:38.570 --> 02:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
for judges and lawyers and those claims
 
02:23:40.429 --> 02:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
are docketed or made public when they're
 
02:23:43.190 --> 02:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
docketed and second it allows the public
 
02:23:45.650 --> 02:23:45.660 align:start position:0%
to be made aware of what's going on
 
02:23:48.050 --> 02:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
in a criminal case the charges are made
 
02:23:49.730 --> 02:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
public when they're docketed just like
 
02:23:51.230 --> 02:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
with these two ethics bodies that
 
02:23:53.330 --> 02:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
regulate lawyers and judges
 
02:23:55.309 --> 02:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
and one of the benefits of that is
 
02:23:57.530 --> 02:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
people that have information related to
 
02:23:59.750 --> 02:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
the incident but may not know that an
 
02:24:01.849 --> 02:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
official proceeding is started can come
 
02:24:03.710 --> 02:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
forward and by pushing back the
 
02:24:06.110 --> 02:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
disclosure date and making the process
 
02:24:08.570 --> 02:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
more transparent it allows people that
 
02:24:10.070 --> 02:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
have been aggrieved
 
02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
notice and time to get involved
 
02:24:15.170 --> 02:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
the second tweak that we would like to
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
see is we would like to change the
 
02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
constituency of the panel as it is now
 
02:24:22.190 --> 02:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
according to the bill there are 17
 
02:24:24.770 --> 02:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
members of the uh 17 people on the
 
02:24:27.950 --> 02:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
council of those 10 are explicitly
 
02:24:30.410 --> 02:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
related to law enforcement either as
 
02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
police or prosecutors
 
02:24:35.330 --> 02:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why this panel came
 
02:24:37.730 --> 02:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
about is because of the liac commission
 
02:24:39.230 --> 02:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
and the liac commission came about
 
02:24:42.110 --> 02:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
because of an outcry in the public if we
 
02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
want this commission this Council to be
 
02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
successful its appearance of fair and
 
02:24:49.969 --> 02:24:49.979 align:start position:0%
balanced approaches to problems is
 
02:24:52.790 --> 02:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
necessary and as it stands now there's
 
02:24:56.210 --> 02:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
no representative on the panel for for
 
02:24:58.250 --> 02:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
example criminal defense lawyers or the
 
02:25:00.889 --> 02:25:00.899 align:start position:0%
ACLU and so we'd asked to have the bill
 
02:25:04.010 --> 02:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
tweak to allow one of those people
 
02:25:06.650 --> 02:25:06.660 align:start position:0%
on the panel as a representative to give
 
02:25:09.190 --> 02:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
it some sort of balance
 
02:25:12.110 --> 02:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
basically it's 10 people who are law
 
02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:13.190 align:start position:0%
basically it's 10 people who are law
enforcement

02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:25:16.429 --> 02:25:16.439 align:start position:0%
seven people who have no connection one
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
way or the other and no one who has
 
02:25:21.410 --> 02:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
experience dealing with the law from the
 
02:25:23.090 --> 02:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
perspective of a criminal defense lawyer
 
02:25:25.370 --> 02:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
or a civil rights litigator and I think
 
02:25:28.010 --> 02:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
that having one person on the panel that
 
02:25:30.650 --> 02:25:30.660 align:start position:0%
does those things would give the public
 
02:25:32.450 --> 02:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
confidence that this is not something
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
where the status stacked the deck in
 
02:25:36.469 --> 02:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
favor of the police
 
02:25:37.969 --> 02:25:37.979 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your time and I'm
 
02:25:42.950 --> 02:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:45.889 --> 02:25:45.899 align:start position:0%
representative Platt thank you thank you
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:25:49.730 --> 02:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
what would prevent
 
02:25:52.130 --> 02:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
a criminal defense attorney
 
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
filing charges against a police officer
 
02:25:57.710 --> 02:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
just to dismourge the name going through
 
02:25:59.090 --> 02:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
this process it's public information
 
02:26:00.950 --> 02:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
meanwhile you've got another case going
 
02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
on involving that officer I mean how
 
02:26:05.270 --> 02:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
could it be abused I mean that's a
 
02:26:06.770 --> 02:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
really good point you know the one that
 
02:26:09.050 --> 02:26:09.060 align:start position:0%
the way that it's currently set up sort
 
02:26:12.530 --> 02:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
of mimics the process for lawyer ethics
 
02:26:14.210 --> 02:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
complaints and judge ethics complaints
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
and that there's a vetting process
 
02:26:19.190 --> 02:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
before the item is docketed so if it's
 
02:26:21.469 --> 02:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
truly a frivolous claim or a claim that
 
02:26:22.849 --> 02:26:22.859 align:start position:0%
even if true wouldn't result in
 
02:26:25.070 --> 02:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
misconduct there's a weed out provision
 
02:26:26.630 --> 02:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
in the bill right now that would prevent
 
02:26:28.490 --> 02:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
that from going forward and that that's
 
02:26:29.809 --> 02:26:29.819 align:start position:0%
a good point and it's an important
 
02:26:31.610 --> 02:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
important thing to have that weed out
 
02:26:31.620 --> 02:26:35.809 align:start position:0%
important thing to have that weed out
provision

02:26:35.809 --> 02:26:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:37.550 --> 02:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
there's no other questions I'm gonna
 
02:26:45.710 --> 02:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:05.510 --> 02:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:08.330 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:27:08.330 --> 02:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:10.670 --> 02:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognizes Matt
 
02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:20.450 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognizes Matt
Broadhead

02:27:20.450 --> 02:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:22.250 --> 02:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
 
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Matt Broadhead I'm
 
02:27:25.550 --> 02:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
a senior Assistant Attorney General for
 
02:27:27.290 --> 02:27:27.300 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire I'm the
 
02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
bureau chief of the transportation and
 
02:27:30.530 --> 02:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
construction Bureau which represents the
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
state police I've had the fortunate
 
02:27:37.610 --> 02:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
honor to help with the legislative
 
02:27:39.710 --> 02:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
component of the liac commission the
 
02:27:42.650 --> 02:27:42.660 align:start position:0%
governor's liac commission and also the
 
02:27:44.030 --> 02:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
study commission that was formed to
 
02:27:46.370 --> 02:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
establish this legislation um
 
02:27:48.590 --> 02:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm pleased to testify here today on
 
02:27:50.090 --> 02:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
behalf of Attorney General John from
 
02:27:51.830 --> 02:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
Ella and the entire department of
 
02:27:53.570 --> 02:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
justice we strongly support this bill
 
02:27:56.630 --> 02:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
especially the important concept that it
 
02:27:58.990 --> 02:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
embodies which is to establish three
 
02:28:02.050 --> 02:28:02.060 align:start position:0%
things and balancing them with
 
02:28:05.210 --> 02:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
important interests from law enforcement
 
02:28:08.210 --> 02:28:08.220 align:start position:0%
so first it provides oversight and
 
02:28:09.710 --> 02:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
accountability and investigations into
 
02:28:12.410 --> 02:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
police misconduct it increases the
 
02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
transparency for confirmed violation uh
 
02:28:17.570 --> 02:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
violations of police misconduct and it
 
02:28:19.550 --> 02:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
promotes consistency and uniformity
 
02:28:21.530 --> 02:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
among police departments as to what
 
02:28:24.770 --> 02:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
actually constitutes misconduct and it
 
02:28:27.950 --> 02:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
balances these important interests while
 
02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
maintaining the Privacy interests of
 
02:28:32.210 --> 02:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
individual police officers who do have
 
02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
frivolous complaints levied against them
 
02:28:37.370 --> 02:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
and it allows local police Chiefs to
 
02:28:39.170 --> 02:28:39.180 align:start position:0%
maintain local control over their
 
02:28:41.389 --> 02:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
employees discipline
 
02:28:43.790 --> 02:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
um and so we strongly urge you to pass
 
02:28:46.250 --> 02:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
this as written by way of background I
 
02:28:49.309 --> 02:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
think not to to go over what has already
 
02:28:52.010 --> 02:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
been said but the concepts of this bill
 
02:28:53.570 --> 02:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
were first envisioned by the liac
 
02:28:55.130 --> 02:28:55.140 align:start position:0%
commission as was said
 
02:28:57.410 --> 02:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
um but however last year the legislature
 
02:28:59.690 --> 02:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
through hb2 created a study commission
 
02:29:03.250 --> 02:29:03.260 align:start position:0%
and it met weekly during the fall
 
02:29:06.650 --> 02:29:06.660 align:start position:0%
and tackled some really important and
 
02:29:10.250 --> 02:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
and tough issues that were raised by
 
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
unions representatives from police
 
02:29:16.150 --> 02:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
unions police Chiefs Association
 
02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
director skippa and his organization the
 
02:29:20.690 --> 02:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
police standards and training Council
 
02:29:24.590 --> 02:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
the ACLU public defender's office and of
 
02:29:25.849 --> 02:29:25.859 align:start position:0%
course the Department of Safety in our
 
02:29:25.859 --> 02:29:26.889 align:start position:0%
course the Department of Safety in our
office

02:29:26.889 --> 02:29:26.899 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:29:30.410 --> 02:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
this strikes a consensus balance from
 
02:29:32.090 --> 02:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
all of these diverse
 
02:29:33.849 --> 02:29:33.859 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders
 
02:29:37.250 --> 02:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
and it was a unanimous report that was
 
02:29:37.260 --> 02:29:38.870 align:start position:0%
and it was a unanimous report that was
filed

02:29:38.870 --> 02:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
filed
 
02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
um and so that is the text of the bill
 
02:29:42.889 --> 02:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
that is before you today is the work of
 
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
that commission which had a lot of hard
 
02:29:45.240 --> 02:29:46.730 align:start position:0%
that commission which had a lot of hard
conversations

02:29:46.730 --> 02:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
02:29:46.740 --> 02:29:47.270 align:start position:0%
conversations
um

02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:49.370 --> 02:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:29:51.410 --> 02:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest frustrations we heard
 
02:29:54.170 --> 02:29:54.180 align:start position:0%
from local police officers and Chiefs is
 
02:29:56.809 --> 02:29:56.819 align:start position:0%
the lack of uniformity specifically with
 
02:29:58.370 --> 02:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
when to report
 
02:30:00.650 --> 02:30:00.660 align:start position:0%
types of misconduct when to report
 
02:30:02.150 --> 02:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
conduct to the Attorney General's office
 
02:30:03.710 --> 02:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
when to report conduct to police
 
02:30:05.570 --> 02:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
standards and training what even
 
02:30:08.450 --> 02:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
constitutes a basis for discipline and
 
02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
what um you know what the standards are
 
02:30:13.550 --> 02:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
this bill also addresses that by
 
02:30:16.010 --> 02:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
creating in-statute a definition of
 
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
misconduct that will apply uniformly to
 
02:30:20.210 --> 02:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
all law enforcement officers it also
 
02:30:23.270 --> 02:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
clarifies and corrects a gap in who is
 
02:30:26.330 --> 02:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
subject to the police standards and
 
02:30:28.910 --> 02:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
training Council uh purview for for the
 
02:30:31.130 --> 02:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
purposes of defining the law enforcement
 
02:30:33.530 --> 02:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
officer itself
 
02:30:35.510 --> 02:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
um it creates technical changes that
 
02:30:37.910 --> 02:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
allows more flexibility on the part of
 
02:30:40.130 --> 02:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
police standards and training to not
 
02:30:42.170 --> 02:30:42.180 align:start position:0%
just take a look at somebody's whether
 
02:30:45.710 --> 02:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
to revoke or suspend uh an officer
 
02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
certification but also to provide
 
02:30:49.910 --> 02:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
additional training to give warnings to
 
02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
do some more of the soft approach to
 
02:30:55.610 --> 02:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
things that actually encourages officers
 
02:30:58.790 --> 02:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
to improve not just to cut bait
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
um so it has a lot of Concepts it's
 
02:31:03.410 --> 02:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
wide-ranging I'm happy to answer any
 
02:31:05.809 --> 02:31:05.819 align:start position:0%
questions I do want to say just a couple
 
02:31:06.910 --> 02:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
more things
 
02:31:09.849 --> 02:31:09.859 align:start position:0%
that about what this bill does
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
it creates that Review Committee and
 
02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
that Review Committee reviews complaints
 
02:31:17.210 --> 02:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
and it can access invest internal
 
02:31:19.130 --> 02:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
investigative files but all of that
 
02:31:21.650 --> 02:31:21.660 align:start position:0%
process is under seal only when it rises
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
to an a uh there's a standard in there
 
02:31:26.630 --> 02:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
that says you know if it meets a
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
sustained or appears to to meet a
 
02:31:31.550 --> 02:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
sustained finding of misconduct then
 
02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
they can make a referral to police
 
02:31:34.429 --> 02:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
standards in training which now holds
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
its hearings in public so they'll public
 
02:31:38.570 --> 02:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
can see the process but the vast
 
02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
majority of the complaints I'm sure
 
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
would be remain sealed in those
 
02:31:45.290 --> 02:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
complaints until there is actually a
 
02:31:48.469 --> 02:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
founding a finding so if there's a fear
 
02:31:51.170 --> 02:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
or concern that there'd be you know uh
 
02:31:52.610 --> 02:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
just making an allegation out there
 
02:31:55.190 --> 02:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
would result in in this publicly public
 
02:31:58.150 --> 02:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
shaming and it's unsustained that still
 
02:32:00.650 --> 02:32:00.660 align:start position:0%
protected under this stat under this
 
02:32:03.889 --> 02:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
proposed statute and then again if it
 
02:32:05.450 --> 02:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
does rise to the level of seriousness
 
02:32:07.429 --> 02:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
then there is a public process then that
 
02:32:09.290 --> 02:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
increases transparency and IT addresses
 
02:32:12.110 --> 02:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
a gap in our system which is when law
 
02:32:14.030 --> 02:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies investigate their
 
02:32:16.370 --> 02:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
own employees there's typically no
 
02:32:19.550 --> 02:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
publicly available document that reports
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
what the results of that investigation
 
02:32:22.849 --> 02:32:22.859 align:start position:0%
are and there's very good reasons for
 
02:32:24.050 --> 02:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
that there's collective bargaining
 
02:32:26.210 --> 02:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
agreements there's things like that
 
02:32:29.809 --> 02:32:29.819 align:start position:0%
um and it may not be a major uh incident
 
02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
of misconduct that rises to the level of
 
02:32:35.330 --> 02:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
public disclosure however what this does
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
is it it's a system in a process that
 
02:32:40.070 --> 02:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
once a complaint is filed there is uh
 
02:32:42.230 --> 02:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
transparency when needed there's a
 
02:32:44.809 --> 02:32:44.819 align:start position:0%
review when needed and then there can be
 
02:32:47.330 --> 02:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
a subsequent investigation in limited
 
02:32:49.670 --> 02:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances if if there is something
 
02:32:51.290 --> 02:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
that just doesn't
 
02:32:53.270 --> 02:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
seem right about the way that the
 
02:32:55.150 --> 02:32:55.160 align:start position:0%
investigation was conducted
 
02:32:58.130 --> 02:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
so this bill is two years in the making
 
02:33:00.590 --> 02:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
um and uh I would it would put New
 
02:33:02.330 --> 02:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on the map in terms of one of
 
02:33:05.030 --> 02:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
the leading States in this area of
 
02:33:08.990 --> 02:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
police reform and I urge its adoption
 
02:33:11.150 --> 02:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
um and again I'm happy to take any
 
02:33:13.490 --> 02:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
questions on this
 
02:33:16.130 --> 02:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
representative Roy you were recognized
 
02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:33:19.730 --> 02:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
taking my question what is the Attorney
 
02:33:23.570 --> 02:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
General's position on the suggestion by
 
02:33:24.790 --> 02:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
the previous
 
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
witness who questioned the makeup of the
 
02:33:31.190 --> 02:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
committee with regard towards a bias
 
02:33:32.750 --> 02:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
towards police
 
02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:33.530 align:start position:0%
towards police
um

02:33:33.530 --> 02:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:36.230 --> 02:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
so I think I'd defer much of that I will
 
02:33:37.730 --> 02:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
answer the question I think director
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
skippa probably would have a more
 
02:33:41.929 --> 02:33:41.939 align:start position:0%
nuanced answer to that because it is his
 
02:33:41.939 --> 02:33:43.370 align:start position:0%
nuanced answer to that because it is his
counsel

02:33:43.370 --> 02:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
02:33:45.650 --> 02:33:45.660 align:start position:0%
um we considered that in the commission
 
02:33:49.250 --> 02:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
ex there was a proposal to expand it
 
02:33:52.210 --> 02:33:52.220 align:start position:0%
um to more than what was proposed here
 
02:33:54.889 --> 02:33:54.899 align:start position:0%
and that was rejected by the commission
 
02:33:57.830 --> 02:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
who had done again adopted this
 
02:33:59.870 --> 02:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
unanimously ultimately
 
02:34:02.469 --> 02:34:02.479 align:start position:0%
um the original Lee act commission
 
02:34:04.750 --> 02:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
envisioned an agency that would review
 
02:34:07.910 --> 02:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
complaints of misconduct with a board
 
02:34:10.130 --> 02:34:10.140 align:start position:0%
that was slightly weighted towards law
 
02:34:11.809 --> 02:34:11.819 align:start position:0%
enforcement that was the that was the
 
02:34:15.410 --> 02:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
original Vision that is embodied in the
 
02:34:18.889 --> 02:34:18.899 align:start position:0%
conduct Review Committee it is it is
 
02:34:21.950 --> 02:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
nearly 50 50 but it is 51 law
 
02:34:24.230 --> 02:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement the police standards and
 
02:34:26.270 --> 02:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
training Council it tied to their
 
02:34:28.809 --> 02:34:28.819 align:start position:0%
certification I don't know if any
 
02:34:30.530 --> 02:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
organization in the state of New
 
02:34:32.090 --> 02:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that has a certification or a
 
02:34:34.370 --> 02:34:34.380 align:start position:0%
license that doesn't that isn't a
 
02:34:37.070 --> 02:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
majority staff with respect to
 
02:34:38.570 --> 02:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
the people who are employed by that
 
02:34:40.730 --> 02:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
profession attorneys oversee attorneys
 
02:34:43.969 --> 02:34:43.979 align:start position:0%
doctors oversee a doctors and certainly
 
02:34:46.250 --> 02:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
there's room here for improvement in
 
02:34:48.349 --> 02:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
terms of the public but this was the
 
02:34:49.670 --> 02:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
balance that the commission thought was
 
02:34:52.429 --> 02:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:56.510 --> 02:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:58.969 --> 02:34:58.979 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
02:35:00.590 --> 02:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you point to me
 
02:35:04.969 --> 02:35:04.979 align:start position:0%
where in the bill there's the uh the
 
02:35:07.250 --> 02:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
vetting of frivolous claims to so
 
02:35:08.450 --> 02:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
02:35:29.690 --> 02:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:32.090 --> 02:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
it if the information's in the bill the
 
02:35:34.250 --> 02:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
witness does not need to locate it's
 
02:35:36.230 --> 02:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
02:35:38.510 --> 02:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
there's a section on accessibility and
 
02:35:41.330 --> 02:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
confidentiality it's on page nine and so
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
I'd commit uh section 106 L 22 to your
 
02:35:48.110 --> 02:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
reading and it sets forth what records
 
02:35:49.370 --> 02:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
are accessed
 
02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:58.790 align:start position:0%
are accessed
yep

02:35:58.790 --> 02:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:00.770 --> 02:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for doing this is
 
02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:08.090 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for doing this is
excused

02:36:08.090 --> 02:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
at this time the channel recognizes John
 
02:36:10.080 --> 02:36:21.889 align:start position:0%
at this time the channel recognizes John
skippa

02:36:21.889 --> 02:36:21.899 align:start position:0%

standards and training is to shape
 
02:37:01.370 --> 02:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
sustain and strengthen the competency
 
02:37:03.650 --> 02:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
and professionalism of New Hampshire law
 
02:37:05.570 --> 02:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
enforcement and that is in service to
 
02:37:07.490 --> 02:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
our state
 
02:37:10.370 --> 02:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
we accomplished this through our dual
 
02:37:12.410 --> 02:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of developing and
 
02:37:14.210 --> 02:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
providing initial and ongoing police
 
02:37:14.220 --> 02:37:15.469 align:start position:0%
providing initial and ongoing police
training

02:37:15.469 --> 02:37:15.479 align:start position:0%
training
 
02:37:17.150 --> 02:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
and that's to all New Hampshire law
 
02:37:19.309 --> 02:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers and also by
 
02:37:21.469 --> 02:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
establishing and enforcing standards for
 
02:37:24.590 --> 02:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
the hiring training and conduct of all
 
02:37:27.469 --> 02:37:27.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement officers
 
02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
I appear uh
 
02:37:32.750 --> 02:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
in front of all of you today to voice my
 
02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:33.889 align:start position:0%
in front of all of you today to voice my
support

02:37:33.889 --> 02:37:33.899 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:37:35.690 --> 02:37:35.700 align:start position:0%
for the proposed legislation that you
 
02:37:38.210 --> 02:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
consider today
 
02:37:40.370 --> 02:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
the impetus of this bill was born during
 
02:37:43.309 --> 02:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
the work of Governor sununu's liac
 
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
commission and that acronym stands for
 
02:37:48.469 --> 02:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
the commission on law enforcement
 
02:37:50.510 --> 02:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
accountability community and
 
02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
transparency which was established and
 
02:37:56.210 --> 02:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
worked through 2020.
 
02:37:58.610 --> 02:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
and it reflects
 
02:38:01.610 --> 02:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
the efforts of many people that were
 
02:38:03.469 --> 02:38:03.479 align:start position:0%
part of that commission and then
 
02:38:05.630 --> 02:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately part of this last committee
 
02:38:07.429 --> 02:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
to work on this legislation
 
02:38:09.469 --> 02:38:09.479 align:start position:0%
each person they are bringing a very
 
02:38:11.690 --> 02:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
different perspective to that overall
 
02:38:15.110 --> 02:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:17.990 --> 02:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately all of us acted in
 
02:38:19.730 --> 02:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
furtherance of the liac recommendation
 
02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
16 that provided really a vision of how
 
02:38:25.429 --> 02:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
police misconduct should be addressed
 
02:38:27.770 --> 02:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
and I think it's important to to uh you
 
02:38:33.889 --> 02:38:33.899 align:start position:0%
know thank uh representative Welch and
 
02:38:36.650 --> 02:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson uh the AG's office and
 
02:38:39.050 --> 02:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
really attorney Matt Broadhead uh for
 
02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
their stewardship uh as we worked
 
02:38:44.270 --> 02:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
through uh some really tough uh
 
02:38:47.870 --> 02:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
conversations uh as we built this uh
 
02:38:51.050 --> 02:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
legislation as proposed
 
02:38:53.929 --> 02:38:53.939 align:start position:0%
the bill as you see it today addresses
 
02:38:55.969 --> 02:38:55.979 align:start position:0%
each of the recommendations that were
 
02:38:58.790 --> 02:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
set forth by the liat commission on this
 
02:38:58.800 --> 02:38:59.929 align:start position:0%
set forth by the liat commission on this
topic

02:38:59.929 --> 02:38:59.939 align:start position:0%
topic
 
02:39:03.349 --> 02:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
specifically under recommendation 16.
 
02:39:06.349 --> 02:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
this bill contemporizes the process for
 
02:39:07.969 --> 02:39:07.979 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement and New
 
02:39:09.889 --> 02:39:09.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police standards and training
 
02:39:12.710 --> 02:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
on how allegations of misconduct would
 
02:39:14.450 --> 02:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
be investigated and presented for
 
02:39:17.030 --> 02:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
hearings and disposition
 
02:39:19.490 --> 02:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
this bill has written clearly defines
 
02:39:22.670 --> 02:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
what police misconduct is
 
02:39:25.670 --> 02:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
this bill has written provides a balance
 
02:39:28.370 --> 02:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
between local control with regulatory
 
02:39:30.590 --> 02:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
oversight and review
 
02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
of allegations of police misconduct
 
02:39:37.250 --> 02:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
it provides due process
 
02:39:39.530 --> 02:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
provides for an open and transparent
 
02:39:42.110 --> 02:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
process with regard to hearings and
 
02:39:42.120 --> 02:39:43.849 align:start position:0%
process with regard to hearings and
dispositions

02:39:43.849 --> 02:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
dispositions
 
02:39:47.330 --> 02:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
it increases the public participation in
 
02:39:48.710 --> 02:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
the process
 
02:39:51.050 --> 02:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
it provides clearly defined expectations
 
02:39:54.590 --> 02:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
of what a valid investigation is
 
02:39:57.170 --> 02:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
and it provides for a central repository
 
02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
of sustained findings of misconduct
 
02:40:03.830 --> 02:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
with public disclosure
 
02:40:06.650 --> 02:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
I would ask for one minor amendment to
 
02:40:09.889 --> 02:40:09.899 align:start position:0%
be made just to correct a just a very
 
02:40:14.809 --> 02:40:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:14.819 --> 02:40:17.090 align:start position:0%
 
request

02:40:17.090 --> 02:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:40:19.670 --> 02:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
I would ask each of you to refer to page
 
02:40:23.389 --> 02:40:23.399 align:start position:0%
10 line 29.
 
02:40:28.490 --> 02:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
and on page 10 line 29 uh
 
02:40:33.290 --> 02:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
I would ask that Roman numeral eight
 
02:40:36.710 --> 02:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
I I be changed to Roman numeral
 
02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:38.389 align:start position:0%
I I be changed to Roman numeral
5V

02:40:38.389 --> 02:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
5V
 
02:40:41.270 --> 02:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
and that they do duplicative verbiage
 
02:40:43.190 --> 02:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
that follows that
 
02:40:45.290 --> 02:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
quote relating to an officer's
 
02:40:48.889 --> 02:40:48.899 align:start position:0%
trustworthiness or credibility be struck
 
02:40:51.730 --> 02:40:51.740 align:start position:0%
so that the entire sentence would read
 
02:40:54.170 --> 02:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding paragraph two any
 
02:40:57.469 --> 02:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
grievance alleging misconduct under RSA
 
02:41:02.450 --> 02:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
106 L2 Roman numeral five B may be filed
 
02:41:03.830 --> 02:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
at any time
 
02:41:07.130 --> 02:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
again this is just minor housekeeping it
 
02:41:09.290 --> 02:41:09.300 align:start position:0%
cleans the language up it strikes the
 
02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
duplicative language and it's and it uh
 
02:41:14.389 --> 02:41:14.399 align:start position:0%
refers back to really what we wanted to
 
02:41:16.250 --> 02:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
make sure we were addressing which was
 
02:41:18.590 --> 02:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh if there is ever a time where a
 
02:41:21.889 --> 02:41:21.899 align:start position:0%
police officer lies uh
 
02:41:23.870 --> 02:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
commits any kind of misconduct with
 
02:41:26.389 --> 02:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
regard to uh their official duties
 
02:41:29.630 --> 02:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
whether that be uh evidence the handling
 
02:41:32.270 --> 02:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
of evidence testimony the way they treat
 
02:41:35.030 --> 02:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
um Witnesses and victims we want to make
 
02:41:37.370 --> 02:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
sure that we can address that regardless
 
02:41:41.929 --> 02:41:41.939 align:start position:0%
of of when uh those allegations come to
 
02:41:43.610 --> 02:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
light and the investigation can be
 
02:41:43.620 --> 02:41:46.309 align:start position:0%
light and the investigation can be
conducted

02:41:46.309 --> 02:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:48.170 --> 02:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
I think it's important also to recognize
 
02:41:51.469 --> 02:41:51.479 align:start position:0%
that some of the requests that were made
 
02:41:54.469 --> 02:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
by the trial attorneys
 
02:41:57.590 --> 02:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
please understand that as we worked
 
02:42:00.410 --> 02:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
through this to build the this bill for
 
02:42:03.230 --> 02:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
your consideration uh the two requests
 
02:42:07.730 --> 02:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
that were made those were two uh
 
02:42:10.849 --> 02:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
requests that were discussed very very
 
02:42:15.469 --> 02:42:15.479 align:start position:0%
deeply during our work and ultimately as
 
02:42:17.870 --> 02:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
a committee we we felt it was very
 
02:42:20.210 --> 02:42:20.220 align:start position:0%
important for us to speak with one voice
 
02:42:23.150 --> 02:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
and unanimously support what was brought
 
02:42:24.889 --> 02:42:24.899 align:start position:0%
before you today
 
02:42:26.809 --> 02:42:26.819 align:start position:0%
and so to that end please understand
 
02:42:28.670 --> 02:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
that those requests that were made today
 
02:42:31.849 --> 02:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
were part of the discussion and uh very
 
02:42:36.110 --> 02:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
deeply uh discussed and ultimately uh
 
02:42:38.510 --> 02:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
they were not accepted as part of our
 
02:42:41.270 --> 02:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
unanimous uh position moving this bill
 
02:42:41.280 --> 02:42:42.650 align:start position:0%
unanimous uh position moving this bill
forward

02:42:42.650 --> 02:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:42:45.770 --> 02:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
again uh I would I would ask that uh
 
02:42:47.450 --> 02:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
with the amendment that I've requested
 
02:42:50.330 --> 02:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
and again that's just a housekeeping uh
 
02:42:50.340 --> 02:42:51.650 align:start position:0%
and again that's just a housekeeping uh
request

02:42:51.650 --> 02:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:42:54.050 --> 02:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
I would ask that this bill be supported
 
02:42:57.050 --> 02:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
and I stand ready for any questions that
 
02:43:00.650 --> 02:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:02.270 --> 02:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative Roy
 
02:43:04.250 --> 02:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:43:05.570 --> 02:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:43:08.389 --> 02:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
over here oh thank you uh if you could
 
02:43:09.770 --> 02:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
just answer the question I asked the
 
02:43:12.469 --> 02:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
previous speaker regarding the the
 
02:43:15.170 --> 02:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
concerns of the other witness that the
 
02:43:17.570 --> 02:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
commission might appear to be biased
 
02:43:20.150 --> 02:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
based on its makeup a little bit too
 
02:43:22.670 --> 02:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
much towards police thank you so I think
 
02:43:25.610 --> 02:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
that um it's a it's a terrific question
 
02:43:28.070 --> 02:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
and it was something that uh candidly
 
02:43:32.690 --> 02:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
was really a point of um some pretty uh
 
02:43:35.510 --> 02:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
Lively debate as we as we put this
 
02:43:35.520 --> 02:43:36.530 align:start position:0%
Lively debate as we as we put this
together

02:43:36.530 --> 02:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:43:36.540 --> 02:43:37.790 align:start position:0%
together
uh

02:43:37.790 --> 02:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:43:40.849 --> 02:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
it was felt across the the group
 
02:43:45.710 --> 02:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
ultimately that to allow uh any one
 
02:43:48.889 --> 02:43:48.899 align:start position:0%
organization to be representative
 
02:43:52.070 --> 02:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
as part of the Review Committee uh or
 
02:43:54.349 --> 02:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
part of police standards and training
 
02:43:56.630 --> 02:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
would in essence exclude
 
02:43:59.210 --> 02:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
other groups that that may want to also
 
02:44:02.450 --> 02:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
have a seat at that Council whether it's
 
02:44:03.950 --> 02:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
the Review Committee or the actual
 
02:44:08.570 --> 02:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
Council and so to that end uh it was
 
02:44:10.309 --> 02:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
felt from from an objective point of
 
02:44:14.150 --> 02:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
view that we increased a number of uh
 
02:44:16.250 --> 02:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
civilian positions
 
02:44:18.469 --> 02:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
on the council
 
02:44:21.530 --> 02:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
in the first instance and and not put
 
02:44:24.230 --> 02:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
limitations on
 
02:44:26.870 --> 02:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
those civilians with regard to whether
 
02:44:29.570 --> 02:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
they have any membership in any uh
 
02:44:32.090 --> 02:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
organization whether that be the ACLU or
 
02:44:34.550 --> 02:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
any other group we just felt that it was
 
02:44:38.330 --> 02:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
more objective and it allowed for
 
02:44:38.340 --> 02:44:38.929 align:start position:0%
more objective and it allowed for
um

02:44:38.929 --> 02:44:38.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:41.570 --> 02:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
really it didn't close the door on any
 
02:44:43.910 --> 02:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
group and that's the reason that we we
 
02:44:45.950 --> 02:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately decided that we would leave
 
02:44:49.130 --> 02:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
it kind of objective and open
 
02:44:49.140 --> 02:44:50.690 align:start position:0%
it kind of objective and open
yeah

02:44:50.690 --> 02:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:44:54.050 --> 02:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
so just for clarity a member of the
 
02:44:56.330 --> 02:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
defense bar a member of the ACLU a
 
02:44:59.389 --> 02:44:59.399 align:start position:0%
member of any other organization is able
 
02:45:02.450 --> 02:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
to sit on this board if they're
 
02:45:02.460 --> 02:45:04.490 align:start position:0%
to sit on this board if they're
appointed

02:45:04.490 --> 02:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
02:45:11.389 --> 02:45:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:13.610 --> 02:45:13.620 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt
 
02:45:15.590 --> 02:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
hello good morning
 
02:45:17.870 --> 02:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
um after an investigation is done by a
 
02:45:19.250 --> 02:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
local police department has turned over
 
02:45:21.050 --> 02:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement conduct Review
 
02:45:23.510 --> 02:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
Committee uh how soon would the
 
02:45:25.010 --> 02:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
investigation take place it looks like
 
02:45:26.990 --> 02:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
you meet quarterly
 
02:45:29.210 --> 02:45:29.220 align:start position:0%
I believe that we wanted to make sure
 
02:45:31.790 --> 02:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:45:34.010 --> 02:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
conduct Review Committee met at least
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
quarterly but certainly
 
02:45:38.330 --> 02:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
you know because this is something new
 
02:45:40.910 --> 02:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
we just don't know uh what the what the
 
02:45:43.429 --> 02:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
workflow will be and whether they would
 
02:45:47.030 --> 02:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
need to meet more often than that so uh
 
02:45:50.270 --> 02:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
you know depending on the the
 
02:45:52.730 --> 02:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
information that's brought and uh
 
02:45:55.969 --> 02:45:55.979 align:start position:0%
whether there's a need to to look into
 
02:45:57.830 --> 02:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
something sooner than later would would
 
02:46:00.590 --> 02:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
dictate how that goes okay one more
 
02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:01.550 align:start position:0%
dictate how that goes okay one more
follow-up

02:46:01.550 --> 02:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:46:04.610 --> 02:46:04.620 align:start position:0%
so I can ask for follow-up would the
 
02:46:06.349 --> 02:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
credentialing be suspended while the
 
02:46:09.530 --> 02:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
investigation is ongoing yes part of uh
 
02:46:10.969 --> 02:46:10.979 align:start position:0%
part of
 
02:46:13.730 --> 02:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
what is written in this bill allows for
 
02:46:16.849 --> 02:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
uh myself to act in very narrow
 
02:46:20.090 --> 02:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
circumstances to suspend
 
02:46:24.830 --> 02:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
upon arrest immediately do an
 
02:46:26.929 --> 02:46:26.939 align:start position:0%
administrative suspension of that
 
02:46:29.270 --> 02:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
certification until such time that the
 
02:46:31.730 --> 02:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
officer can be brought before the the
 
02:46:34.150 --> 02:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
council to be heard on the matter
 
02:46:37.250 --> 02:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
otherwise the allegation would need to
 
02:46:41.870 --> 02:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
be uh in essence sustained and then that
 
02:46:44.690 --> 02:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
would again be brought to the council's
 
02:46:46.550 --> 02:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
attention through hearing and then
 
02:46:48.410 --> 02:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
that's where the action would would be
 
02:46:48.420 --> 02:46:49.610 align:start position:0%
that's where the action would would be
taken

02:46:49.610 --> 02:46:49.620 align:start position:0%
taken
 
02:46:51.590 --> 02:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
so would they be would they be able to
 
02:46:51.600 --> 02:46:52.429 align:start position:0%
so would they be would they be able to
work

02:46:52.429 --> 02:46:52.439 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:46:54.530 --> 02:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
and with uh suspended credentials could
 
02:46:56.090 --> 02:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
they do some kind of work are they going
 
02:46:58.250 --> 02:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
to be suspended from work no presently
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
as it stands now any any officer that
 
02:47:03.410 --> 02:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
has their certification suspended in
 
02:47:05.570 --> 02:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
fact has lost their license to work as a
 
02:47:07.429 --> 02:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
police officer and they cannot act in
 
02:47:11.690 --> 02:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
any capacity wear uniform or even you
 
02:47:13.270 --> 02:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
know remotely
 
02:47:15.770 --> 02:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
kind of put out the notion that they are
 
02:47:18.050 --> 02:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
acting as a law enforcement officer okay
 
02:47:20.150 --> 02:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome sir
 
02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:23.809 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome sir
okay

02:47:23.809 --> 02:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:27.530 --> 02:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:30.050 --> 02:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
at one point in your testimony you
 
02:47:32.630 --> 02:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
referred to local control which can
 
02:47:34.670 --> 02:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes be a contentious issue what
 
02:47:35.870 --> 02:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
that means
 
02:47:38.090 --> 02:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
so could you clarify that because it
 
02:47:39.469 --> 02:47:39.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear that the appointment's a
 
02:47:41.450 --> 02:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
local control what what exactly were you
 
02:47:43.370 --> 02:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
referring to when you said it has local
 
02:47:45.410 --> 02:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
control for something
 
02:47:49.070 --> 02:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you sir uh for that question
 
02:47:52.610 --> 02:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
as we were fashioning this uh what we
 
02:47:56.330 --> 02:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure was that if any
 
02:47:59.090 --> 02:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
allegation of misconduct is made
 
02:48:01.730 --> 02:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
against a police officer
 
02:48:03.710 --> 02:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
the initial responsibility of
 
02:48:06.469 --> 02:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
investigating that allegation would be
 
02:48:08.030 --> 02:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
left to the chief law enforcement
 
02:48:10.010 --> 02:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
officer of that agency
 
02:48:12.650 --> 02:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
that chief law enforcement officer will
 
02:48:17.389 --> 02:48:17.399 align:start position:0%
need to adhere to a valid investigation
 
02:48:20.809 --> 02:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
and then subsequent to that valid
 
02:48:23.330 --> 02:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
investigation it would be turned into
 
02:48:25.849 --> 02:48:25.859 align:start position:0%
the Review Committee for review
 
02:48:28.429 --> 02:48:28.439 align:start position:0%
if in fact the Review Committee felt
 
02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
that the investigation did not meet a
 
02:48:32.990 --> 02:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
valid investigation or that there was
 
02:48:36.170 --> 02:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
defects in that investigation this
 
02:48:37.910 --> 02:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
legislation would give power to the
 
02:48:40.730 --> 02:48:40.740 align:start position:0%
Review Committee to direct
 
02:48:44.929 --> 02:48:44.939 align:start position:0%
either a de novo investigation or to
 
02:48:48.050 --> 02:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
augment the investigation and work
 
02:48:51.650 --> 02:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
independently of that that local entity
 
02:48:53.870 --> 02:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
that did the the initial investigation
 
02:48:57.349 --> 02:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
so there's kind of a uh
 
02:49:00.530 --> 02:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
an overview of or an oversight of how
 
02:49:02.570 --> 02:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
these things will be conducted and then
 
02:49:04.730 --> 02:49:04.740 align:start position:0%
kind of maintaining consistency across
 
02:49:06.590 --> 02:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
the state as to how they're conducted in
 
02:49:08.330 --> 02:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
the findings thereof
 
02:49:15.889 --> 02:49:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:18.170 --> 02:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
representative Conley thank you and
 
02:49:19.730 --> 02:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question it's
 
02:49:22.070 --> 02:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
quite clear that a tremendous amount of
 
02:49:24.349 --> 02:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
effort and foresight went into the
 
02:49:26.150 --> 02:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and the makeup of the
 
02:49:29.450 --> 02:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
committee uh my concern and I'm getting
 
02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
to the question is about perception
 
02:49:35.030 --> 02:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
public perception of the work of this
 
02:49:37.790 --> 02:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
body and by waiting the membership in
 
02:49:39.830 --> 02:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
the way that it is weighted such that
 
02:49:42.469 --> 02:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
law enforcement is given those uh for
 
02:49:45.469 --> 02:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
better 10 members versus seven with the
 
02:49:47.030 --> 02:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
non-law enforcement connection are you
 
02:49:48.830 --> 02:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
concerned at all that the findings of
 
02:49:50.990 --> 02:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
this body would not be considered
 
02:49:52.910 --> 02:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
legitimate by a good person a good
 
02:49:55.030 --> 02:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
percentage of our state
 
02:49:58.670 --> 02:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh it's an excellent question and uh and
 
02:50:00.650 --> 02:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
it brings to light maybe
 
02:50:00.660 --> 02:50:04.190 align:start position:0%
it brings to light maybe
um

02:50:04.190 --> 02:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:06.170 --> 02:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for me to kind of explain
 
02:50:08.389 --> 02:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
the two sides of the house in the first
 
02:50:11.330 --> 02:50:11.340 align:start position:0%
instance uh this bill establishes a
 
02:50:13.250 --> 02:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
conduct Review Committee which is
 
02:50:15.889 --> 02:50:15.899 align:start position:0%
weighted about 51 percent to law
 
02:50:18.110 --> 02:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement and in fact we would have a
 
02:50:20.510 --> 02:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
prosecutor that oversees that committee
 
02:50:22.309 --> 02:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the investigations are
 
02:50:23.630 --> 02:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
done correctly
 
02:50:30.410 --> 02:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:34.070 --> 02:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
sustained finding then they will uh that
 
02:50:36.349 --> 02:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
attorney will bring it to police
 
02:50:38.510 --> 02:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
standards and training Council
 
02:50:38.520 --> 02:50:40.070 align:start position:0%
standards and training Council
uh

02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:50:41.809 --> 02:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
I think I'm understanding you uh
 
02:50:44.450 --> 02:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
representative Conley that um
 
02:50:47.809 --> 02:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
the question is whether the council make
 
02:50:47.819 --> 02:50:48.849 align:start position:0%
the question is whether the council make
up

02:50:48.849 --> 02:50:48.859 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:50:51.590 --> 02:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
does not provide legitimacy because of
 
02:50:53.210 --> 02:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
the the way it's weighted do I
 
02:50:56.450 --> 02:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:58.429 --> 02:50:58.439 align:start position:0%
you do and just the concern that
 
02:51:01.010 --> 02:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
somebody would presume correctly or
 
02:51:04.730 --> 02:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
incorrectly that a finding was made in a
 
02:51:06.710 --> 02:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
certain way based on the makeup of that
 
02:51:08.330 --> 02:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
board not based on the facts of a
 
02:51:09.650 --> 02:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
certain incident
 
02:51:13.309 --> 02:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
yeah we do we as we presently operate
 
02:51:15.170 --> 02:51:15.180 align:start position:0%
um that
 
02:51:18.050 --> 02:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
that does not appear to be a concern
 
02:51:20.210 --> 02:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
um and and please understand that this
 
02:51:22.490 --> 02:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
process that we're talking about now
 
02:51:24.650 --> 02:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
really does happen it's not nearly as
 
02:51:28.070 --> 02:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
contemporized as it happens or will
 
02:51:31.130 --> 02:51:31.140 align:start position:0%
happen if this bill goes to law
 
02:51:31.140 --> 02:51:31.849 align:start position:0%
happen if this bill goes to law
um

02:51:31.849 --> 02:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:34.429 --> 02:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
the ultimately you know we have judges
 
02:51:36.170 --> 02:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
we have the attorney general that sits
 
02:51:37.969 --> 02:51:37.979 align:start position:0%
on this board we do have some some
 
02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
civilians that sit on the board of
 
02:51:39.840 --> 02:51:41.210 align:start position:0%
civilians that sit on the board of
council

02:51:41.210 --> 02:51:41.220 align:start position:0%
council
 
02:51:44.090 --> 02:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
as it stands now uh we wanted to
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
increase the number of of uh citizens
 
02:51:46.560 --> 02:51:48.349 align:start position:0%
increase the number of of uh citizens
and

02:51:48.349 --> 02:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:51:51.050 --> 02:51:51.060 align:start position:0%
um and we did uh within this bill but
 
02:51:54.590 --> 02:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
that the council would act as the the
 
02:51:56.510 --> 02:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
Arbiter in the
 
02:52:00.290 --> 02:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
um in this case so the Review Committee
 
02:52:02.809 --> 02:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
would bring the case for hearing in
 
02:52:04.790 --> 02:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
front of the council and that's a that's
 
02:52:05.889 --> 02:52:05.899 align:start position:0%
a public
 
02:52:09.410 --> 02:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
event that's open to the public and with
 
02:52:12.290 --> 02:52:12.300 align:start position:0%
very very minor exceptions uh
 
02:52:15.230 --> 02:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
we cannot do things in in uh non-public
 
02:52:17.630 --> 02:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
session any longer so I I just think
 
02:52:20.570 --> 02:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
that it is you know objectively it is
 
02:52:22.969 --> 02:52:22.979 align:start position:0%
arranged in a way that will certainly
 
02:52:25.910 --> 02:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
allow everyone to see you know the
 
02:52:28.250 --> 02:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
process understand the process hear the
 
02:52:31.309 --> 02:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
deliberation as they uh you know try to
 
02:52:34.130 --> 02:52:34.140 align:start position:0%
reach a resolution I don't think that
 
02:52:36.170 --> 02:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
the Optics of it
 
02:52:36.180 --> 02:52:36.830 align:start position:0%
the Optics of it
um

02:52:36.830 --> 02:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:40.969 --> 02:52:40.979 align:start position:0%
are are something that would cause the
 
02:52:44.210 --> 02:52:44.220 align:start position:0%
average citizen to be concerned about
 
02:52:47.269 --> 02:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:49.250 --> 02:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
and if the chair May inquire and thank
 
02:52:52.269 --> 02:52:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:54.349 --> 02:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
your testimony may have covered some of
 
02:52:55.910 --> 02:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
this but perhaps you could maybe explain
 
02:52:57.590 --> 02:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
to the committee the procedure from the
 
02:52:59.450 --> 02:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
beginning to the end what would occur if
 
02:53:02.030 --> 02:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
a complaint or was made
 
02:53:04.910 --> 02:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:07.309 --> 02:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
the way we uh Envision this and the way
 
02:53:09.469 --> 02:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
it's been written is that if there is an
 
02:53:12.590 --> 02:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
allegation of misconduct as defined
 
02:53:14.349 --> 02:53:14.359 align:start position:0%
within this bill
 
02:53:18.050 --> 02:53:18.060 align:start position:0%
uh the if if the allegation is made at
 
02:53:20.269 --> 02:53:20.279 align:start position:0%
the local level and that happens quite
 
02:53:22.190 --> 02:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
often uh and it's important to know that
 
02:53:23.929 --> 02:53:23.939 align:start position:0%
I've I've spent 35 years in law
 
02:53:25.730 --> 02:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
enforcement and I was a chief of police
 
02:53:28.969 --> 02:53:28.979 align:start position:0%
on the Seacoast for a number of years
 
02:53:31.670 --> 02:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
when an allegation like that comes in
 
02:53:34.849 --> 02:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
uh generally uh it is just handled at
 
02:53:36.170 --> 02:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
that local level
 
02:53:38.630 --> 02:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
and uh there's no
 
02:53:38.640 --> 02:53:39.670 align:start position:0%
and uh there's no
um

02:53:39.670 --> 02:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:42.050 --> 02:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
there's no consistency across the state
 
02:53:44.150 --> 02:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
as to how that happens so the way we
 
02:53:45.830 --> 02:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
envision it is if there's a local
 
02:53:47.990 --> 02:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
complaint that comes in alleging
 
02:53:50.450 --> 02:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
misconduct uh then that chief law
 
02:53:51.950 --> 02:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer would let police
 
02:53:54.110 --> 02:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
standards and training know that hey we
 
02:53:57.170 --> 02:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
just received this complaint and we are
 
02:53:59.510 --> 02:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
investigating it or
 
02:54:02.389 --> 02:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
we have an outside agency investigating
 
02:54:06.950 --> 02:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
it or we're not sure if we can do this
 
02:54:09.110 --> 02:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
ourselves and we're asking for police
 
02:54:11.570 --> 02:54:11.580 align:start position:0%
standards and training to come down and
 
02:54:12.830 --> 02:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
investigate it
 
02:54:16.250 --> 02:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh once the investigation is complete it
 
02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
would be uh all of all the documents
 
02:54:21.050 --> 02:54:21.060 align:start position:0%
would go to the conduct Review Committee
 
02:54:23.570 --> 02:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
they would review that investigation to
 
02:54:26.450 --> 02:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
ensure that it was done correctly that
 
02:54:28.130 --> 02:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
there's no follow-up that needs to be
 
02:54:30.530 --> 02:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
done and then ultimately they would
 
02:54:34.610 --> 02:54:34.620 align:start position:0%
decide whether uh they could sustain a
 
02:54:38.750 --> 02:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
finding or or move that forward in a
 
02:54:41.269 --> 02:54:41.279 align:start position:0%
hearing in front of the council if they
 
02:54:43.370 --> 02:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
felt that that was something that should
 
02:54:44.870 --> 02:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
be brought before the council that it
 
02:54:47.330 --> 02:54:47.340 align:start position:0%
sustained a finding of misconduct then
 
02:54:49.389 --> 02:54:49.399 align:start position:0%
the staff attorney
 
02:54:52.610 --> 02:54:52.620 align:start position:0%
acting as a prosecutor and in an
 
02:54:56.590 --> 02:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
adversarial way would bring that
 
02:55:00.170 --> 02:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
complaint forward to the council they
 
02:55:03.050 --> 02:55:03.060 align:start position:0%
would prosecute the case the officer
 
02:55:06.230 --> 02:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
would be entitled to defend the case if
 
02:55:08.510 --> 02:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
they wanted to and then the police
 
02:55:10.849 --> 02:55:10.859 align:start position:0%
standards and training Council in
 
02:55:14.170 --> 02:55:14.180 align:start position:0%
essence would act as the judge and uh
 
02:55:17.929 --> 02:55:17.939 align:start position:0%
reach a a verdict on on whether it was
 
02:55:20.570 --> 02:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
proven Beyond a preponderance and then
 
02:55:26.690 --> 02:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:29.150 --> 02:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you sir
 
02:55:38.090 --> 02:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:41.330 --> 02:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:44.030 --> 02:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
does this piece of legislation
 
02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:46.250 align:start position:0%
does this piece of legislation
preclude

02:55:46.250 --> 02:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
preclude
 
02:55:49.849 --> 02:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
criminals courts set up where the the
 
02:55:52.910 --> 02:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
officer would be criminally charged
 
02:55:56.210 --> 02:55:56.220 align:start position:0%
does this eliminate that
 
02:55:58.190 --> 02:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question uh
 
02:56:00.469 --> 02:56:00.479 align:start position:0%
representative and it does not and in
 
02:56:02.269 --> 02:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
fact uh
 
02:56:05.050 --> 02:56:05.060 align:start position:0%
within this bill it very clearly defines
 
02:56:09.469 --> 02:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
uh that this bill would not in any way
 
02:56:12.889 --> 02:56:12.899 align:start position:0%
get uh impede the local authority to
 
02:56:15.290 --> 02:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
impose their own sanctions if if
 
02:56:18.769 --> 02:56:18.779 align:start position:0%
necessary and it's certainly also allows
 
02:56:18.779 --> 02:56:20.410 align:start position:0%
necessary and it's certainly also allows
for

02:56:20.410 --> 02:56:20.420 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:56:24.410 --> 02:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
prosecution in criminal events again we
 
02:56:25.969 --> 02:56:25.979 align:start position:0%
envision that if somebody makes an
 
02:56:28.690 --> 02:56:28.700 align:start position:0%
allegation of misconduct and it reflects
 
02:56:31.790 --> 02:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
unlawful or criminal activity that was
 
02:56:34.010 --> 02:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
committed by a police officer while
 
02:56:35.769 --> 02:56:35.779 align:start position:0%
they're on duty
 
02:56:38.210 --> 02:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
that would go directly to the public
 
02:56:40.190 --> 02:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
Integrity unit of the AG's office
 
02:56:43.130 --> 02:56:43.140 align:start position:0%
because the criminal case certainly
 
02:56:45.950 --> 02:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
would take precedence over the
 
02:56:48.230 --> 02:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
misconduct case and so we would let them
 
02:56:50.690 --> 02:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
work the criminal side first
 
02:56:55.090 --> 02:56:55.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:58.250 --> 02:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony Mr chairman
 
02:57:09.769 --> 02:57:09.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
this time that you're now recognizes
 
02:57:17.750 --> 02:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:20.510 --> 02:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
I think I got the process now
 
02:57:23.150 --> 02:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
good morning uh honorable chairman and
 
02:57:24.710 --> 02:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members for the
 
02:57:26.630 --> 02:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
record my name is Eddie Edwards I am the
 
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner at the department
 
02:57:30.650 --> 02:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
of safety my parents here today is in
 
02:57:33.230 --> 02:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
support of this bill on the on behalf of
 
02:57:35.690 --> 02:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety we believe that
 
02:57:37.130 --> 02:57:37.140 align:start position:0%
this bill provides the necessary
 
02:57:40.610 --> 02:57:40.620 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability and due
 
02:57:42.050 --> 02:57:42.060 align:start position:0%
process necessarily whole police
 
02:57:45.230 --> 02:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
officers accountable it as a original
 
02:57:48.050 --> 02:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
member of the liac commission
 
02:57:52.610 --> 02:57:52.620 align:start position:0%
I supported the process there I I don't
 
02:57:54.410 --> 02:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
think we can lose sight of the fact that
 
02:57:56.030 --> 02:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation really does
 
02:57:59.349 --> 02:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
put New Hampshire on a map of his own
 
02:58:02.809 --> 02:58:02.819 align:start position:0%
very few states have taken this uh
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
process going from the liac commission
 
02:58:07.910 --> 02:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
to a commission to study misconduct and
 
02:58:10.429 --> 02:58:10.439 align:start position:0%
now producing a product like this I I've
 
02:58:12.349 --> 02:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
traveled uh throughout the United States
 
02:58:13.849 --> 02:58:13.859 align:start position:0%
training law enforcement officers in
 
02:58:15.290 --> 02:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
probably 21 different states over the
 
02:58:17.929 --> 02:58:17.939 align:start position:0%
course of my career and this is a pretty
 
02:58:20.030 --> 02:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
robust piece of legislation that allows
 
02:58:21.950 --> 02:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
us to hold people accountable in the
 
02:58:22.969 --> 02:58:22.979 align:start position:0%
proper way
 
02:58:26.269 --> 02:58:26.279 align:start position:0%
so uh I do want to point out because I
 
02:58:29.929 --> 02:58:29.939 align:start position:0%
think um assistant AG Broadhead pointed
 
02:58:30.889 --> 02:58:30.899 align:start position:0%
this out
 
02:58:33.889 --> 02:58:33.899 align:start position:0%
on the issue of weighted the committee
 
02:58:35.389 --> 02:58:35.399 align:start position:0%
being weighted towards law enforcement
 
02:58:38.210 --> 02:58:38.220 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make sure that the this uh
 
02:58:40.370 --> 02:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
Review Committee was set up and
 
02:58:43.210 --> 02:58:43.220 align:start position:0%
structured like all other professional
 
02:58:45.790 --> 02:58:45.800 align:start position:0%
licensed Professionals in the state
 
02:58:48.410 --> 02:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
where they are weighted towards the
 
02:58:51.290 --> 02:58:51.300 align:start position:0%
Professionals in that occupation this
 
02:58:54.070 --> 02:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
was modeled after the attorney
 
02:58:56.809 --> 02:58:56.819 align:start position:0%
disciplinary board
 
02:59:00.469 --> 02:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
an employee attorney disciplinary board
 
02:59:02.950 --> 02:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
this is the model they have for judges
 
02:59:05.809 --> 02:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and other attorneys so we
 
02:59:08.090 --> 02:59:08.100 align:start position:0%
want to make sure this was consistent
 
02:59:10.070 --> 02:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much uh and I'm happy
 
02:59:16.429 --> 02:59:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:22.670 --> 02:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:24.590 --> 02:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
it's time to train our recognizes Joseph

support of HB 1682 I will also be
 
02:59:53.819 --> 02:59:55.010 align:start position:0%
support of HB 1682 I will also be
speaking

02:59:55.010 --> 02:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
02:59:56.929 --> 02:59:56.939 align:start position:0%
um as a commission member I did serve on
 
02:59:58.670 --> 02:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
the original liak commission that came
 
03:00:00.590 --> 03:00:00.600 align:start position:0%
up with this recommendation as well as
 
03:00:02.590 --> 03:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
the study commission that worked on
 
03:00:04.969 --> 03:00:04.979 align:start position:0%
drafting this language
 
03:00:07.070 --> 03:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
one of the first things that I just want
 
03:00:09.590 --> 03:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
to speak on is the fact that this bill
 
03:00:12.830 --> 03:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
right here is um the work of many
 
03:00:14.630 --> 03:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
different perspectives the community
 
03:00:17.510 --> 03:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
perspective that I will be representing
 
03:00:17.520 --> 03:00:21.290 align:start position:0%
perspective that I will be representing
uh

03:00:21.290 --> 03:00:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:25.370 --> 03:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
agrees and supports this bill this
 
03:00:26.690 --> 03:00:26.700 align:start position:0%
created something where there was
 
03:00:29.150 --> 03:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
nothing if if this existed we wouldn't
 
03:00:31.670 --> 03:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
have had to write this legislation so in
 
03:00:35.030 --> 03:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
in that sense that there is a new body
 
03:00:36.889 --> 03:00:36.899 align:start position:0%
that will hopefully be coming to the
 
03:00:38.750 --> 03:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
state that will address the concerns
 
03:00:40.849 --> 03:00:40.859 align:start position:0%
that many community members have voiced
 
03:00:42.290 --> 03:00:42.300 align:start position:0%
and and that's one of the first things
 
03:00:44.570 --> 03:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
it does is it creates a uniform
 
03:00:46.790 --> 03:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
definition of misconduct that was a
 
03:00:49.250 --> 03:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
concern before that uh we had different
 
03:00:51.410 --> 03:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
departments that would have different
 
03:00:53.809 --> 03:00:53.819 align:start position:0%
definitions of misconduct it wasn't the
 
03:00:56.630 --> 03:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
same and so having this Universal
 
03:00:59.450 --> 03:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
definition is um is a benefit for the
 
03:01:00.830 --> 03:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
state and for the for our community
 
03:01:00.840 --> 03:01:02.030 align:start position:0%
state and for the for our community
members

03:01:02.030 --> 03:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
members
 
03:01:05.750 --> 03:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
one of the original Three uh reasons
 
03:01:07.910 --> 03:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
that leak uh came up with this
 
03:01:10.490 --> 03:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
recommendation was it for it to be a
 
03:01:12.110 --> 03:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
investigatory body
 
03:01:14.090 --> 03:01:14.100 align:start position:0%
it would also be neutral and independent
 
03:01:17.090 --> 03:01:17.100 align:start position:0%
and it would have public members
 
03:01:19.610 --> 03:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
and so uh
 
03:01:23.150 --> 03:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
speaking on the investatory part uh I do
 
03:01:24.889 --> 03:01:24.899 align:start position:0%
believe that some of that those Powers
 
03:01:27.290 --> 03:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
have been shifted down from what the
 
03:01:29.269 --> 03:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
original recommendation was being that
 
03:01:32.750 --> 03:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
this body could just independently do an
 
03:01:34.910 --> 03:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
investigation but that still now is in
 
03:01:38.690 --> 03:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
this bill uh where you can where they
 
03:01:41.210 --> 03:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
have this power after receiving a valid
 
03:01:44.269 --> 03:01:44.279 align:start position:0%
complaint to investigate and review
 
03:01:46.670 --> 03:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
um review invest the investigations and
 
03:01:48.889 --> 03:01:48.899 align:start position:0%
reports that they have received
 
03:01:51.590 --> 03:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
the public member access to this uh
 
03:01:53.809 --> 03:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
Council and committee is extremely
 
03:01:56.389 --> 03:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
important because it speaks to again uh
 
03:01:58.309 --> 03:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
the validity that representative Conley
 
03:01:59.870 --> 03:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
was speaking about and I believe that
 
03:02:01.750 --> 03:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
03:02:04.670 --> 03:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
has spoken to that
 
03:02:07.670 --> 03:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
believing and making sure that this body
 
03:02:09.469 --> 03:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
is acting in the interest of community
 
03:02:13.190 --> 03:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
members and transparency is their
 
03:02:14.389 --> 03:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
um we will be speaking more about
 
03:02:17.510 --> 03:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
transparency uh Henry uh Mr clementonas
 
03:02:19.250 --> 03:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
will be talking about that but again
 
03:02:21.050 --> 03:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
this is
 
03:02:25.070 --> 03:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
um this is a bill that will answer the
 
03:02:26.809 --> 03:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
community concerns
 
03:02:28.969 --> 03:02:28.979 align:start position:0%
um with at the same time balancing law
 
03:02:30.889 --> 03:02:30.899 align:start position:0%
enforcement's concerns about uh due
 
03:02:32.809 --> 03:02:32.819 align:start position:0%
process rights one of the things I do
 
03:02:34.309 --> 03:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
want to just point out quickly because I
 
03:02:37.610 --> 03:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
did speak to director skippa was on page
 
03:02:37.620 --> 03:02:38.990 align:start position:0%
did speak to director skippa was on page
four

03:02:38.990 --> 03:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
four
 
03:02:40.550 --> 03:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
um on page four when we're talking about
 
03:02:42.349 --> 03:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
the public members
 
03:02:45.050 --> 03:02:45.060 align:start position:0%
uh it it is saying that they're they're
 
03:02:47.150 --> 03:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
that the public members could not be an
 
03:02:49.370 --> 03:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
officer lawyer or judge and and I just
 
03:02:50.990 --> 03:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to clear to clarify that which
 
03:02:53.630 --> 03:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
which I spoke with uh uh attorney
 
03:02:56.630 --> 03:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
general Broadhead and skippa that it
 
03:02:58.849 --> 03:02:58.859 align:start position:0%
wasn't that a person couldn't be a
 
03:03:01.010 --> 03:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
lawyer or judge that they on this it was
 
03:03:02.570 --> 03:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
that you couldn't represent an
 
03:03:02.580 --> 03:03:04.010 align:start position:0%
that you couldn't represent an
organization

03:03:04.010 --> 03:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
organization
 
03:03:05.870 --> 03:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
um an advocacy or organization or
 
03:03:08.090 --> 03:03:08.100 align:start position:0%
something of that nature so and that
 
03:03:10.849 --> 03:03:10.859 align:start position:0%
comes from one of the potential
 
03:03:13.130 --> 03:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
recommendations in this was that a
 
03:03:15.590 --> 03:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative of law enforcement who
 
03:03:17.330 --> 03:03:17.340 align:start position:0%
was at the rank of lieutenant and Below
 
03:03:20.389 --> 03:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
representing a a union
 
03:03:22.429 --> 03:03:22.439 align:start position:0%
um could could be on this and so to
 
03:03:24.830 --> 03:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
balance that concern that you know that
 
03:03:27.349 --> 03:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
it we need to be objective that was
 
03:03:28.969 --> 03:03:28.979 align:start position:0%
where it was that there wouldn't be an
 
03:03:31.250 --> 03:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization attached but that
 
03:03:33.710 --> 03:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
didn't mean that a person couldn't be a
 
03:03:35.690 --> 03:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
lawyer a judge so I would just be that
 
03:03:36.769 --> 03:03:36.779 align:start position:0%
is one thing I would just want to flag
 
03:03:38.510 --> 03:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
about the language that that that needed
 
03:03:39.830 --> 03:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
to be corrected it wasn't the fact that
 
03:03:42.290 --> 03:03:42.300 align:start position:0%
a person could be couldn't be a lawyer a
 
03:03:43.190 --> 03:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
judge it was just that they weren't
 
03:03:45.590 --> 03:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
representing an organization in an
 
03:03:47.630 --> 03:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
official capacity
 
03:03:49.309 --> 03:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
with that I am happy to take any
 
03:03:50.330 --> 03:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have at the end
 
03:03:51.889 --> 03:03:51.899 align:start position:0%
and I want to turn it over to um Mr
 
03:03:54.050 --> 03:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
clementon's to talk about transparency I
 
03:03:55.730 --> 03:03:55.740 align:start position:0%
saw a lot of some confused looks on the
 
03:03:57.950 --> 03:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
committee are you
 
03:04:00.469 --> 03:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
so under on page four with what you were
 
03:04:02.389 --> 03:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
just referring to trade four line 17
 
03:04:07.610 --> 03:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
lines 16 17 and 18. correct are you
 
03:04:09.889 --> 03:04:09.899 align:start position:0%
suggesting that that is intended to read
 
03:04:13.309 --> 03:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
that an attorney or a lawyer could serve
 
03:04:14.750 --> 03:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
as a member of the public provided
 
03:04:15.769 --> 03:04:15.779 align:start position:0%
they're not representing any
 
03:04:18.290 --> 03:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
organization if they're yes they're not
 
03:04:19.969 --> 03:04:19.979 align:start position:0%
they're not representing an official
 
03:04:21.710 --> 03:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
organization yes
 
03:04:23.570 --> 03:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
because I
 
03:04:26.330 --> 03:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
that's in does that doesn't say that so
 
03:04:29.030 --> 03:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is
 
03:04:31.130 --> 03:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
was that the intent of the the committee
 
03:04:32.750 --> 03:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
or the commission I met over the
 
03:04:34.849 --> 03:04:34.859 align:start position:0%
summertime yes and that's what I was
 
03:04:36.349 --> 03:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
that's what I was double checking this
 
03:04:36.359 --> 03:04:38.210 align:start position:0%
that's what I was double checking this
morning

03:04:38.210 --> 03:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
morning
 
03:04:40.969 --> 03:04:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:42.170 --> 03:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
it that's what I that's what I was
 
03:04:43.849 --> 03:04:43.859 align:start position:0%
double choking with um
 
03:04:45.290 --> 03:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
director skip
 
03:04:47.330 --> 03:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
PA and Broadhead but yes that was the
 
03:04:49.250 --> 03:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
original intent it wasn't that it that
 
03:04:50.630 --> 03:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
they couldn't be those functions that
 
03:04:53.330 --> 03:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be doing it in an official
 
03:04:53.340 --> 03:04:55.190 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be doing it in an official
capacity

03:04:55.190 --> 03:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
03:04:57.429 --> 03:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:05:00.170 --> 03:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
03:05:02.030 --> 03:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Henry clementowicz
 
03:05:04.969 --> 03:05:04.979 align:start position:0%
I'm also I'm a senior staff attorney at
 
03:05:07.070 --> 03:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
the ACLU of New Hampshire I wanted to
 
03:05:08.630 --> 03:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about the transparency
 
03:05:13.130 --> 03:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
Provisions in uh this legislation ACLU
 
03:05:15.110 --> 03:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is generally supportive
 
03:05:19.130 --> 03:05:19.140 align:start position:0%
of the language as drafted however we
 
03:05:20.929 --> 03:05:20.939 align:start position:0%
felt at the end of the study commission
 
03:05:22.610 --> 03:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
that there wasn't quite enough time to
 
03:05:24.410 --> 03:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
fully reach complete agreement on the
 
03:05:26.630 --> 03:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
transparency and so we reserved our
 
03:05:29.210 --> 03:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
rights to propose further language
 
03:05:32.450 --> 03:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
changes so in our written testimony we
 
03:05:34.370 --> 03:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
submitted a proposed amendment that
 
03:05:37.250 --> 03:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
would secure our full support around the
 
03:05:39.650 --> 03:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
transparency process and I just want to
 
03:05:39.660 --> 03:05:41.510 align:start position:0%
transparency process and I just want to
briefly

03:05:41.510 --> 03:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
03:05:43.849 --> 03:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
um make those points if I may
 
03:05:45.530 --> 03:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
there's just a couple changes I think
 
03:05:47.389 --> 03:05:47.399 align:start position:0%
that they're pretty modest
 
03:05:51.290 --> 03:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
um for example on page 9 lines 25
 
03:05:53.750 --> 03:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
through 28.
 
03:05:57.190 --> 03:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
um the the language as written
 
03:05:59.510 --> 03:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
provides that
 
03:05:59.520 --> 03:06:01.190 align:start position:0%
provides that
um

03:06:01.190 --> 03:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:04.910 --> 03:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes uh
 
03:06:04.920 --> 03:06:06.349 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes uh
um

03:06:06.349 --> 03:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:09.710 --> 03:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
on page 10 I'm sorry lines two through
 
03:06:11.809 --> 03:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
nine the language is currently written
 
03:06:13.990 --> 03:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
provides that the records of the public
 
03:06:16.490 --> 03:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
of the police standards and training
 
03:06:18.590 --> 03:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
Council will be made public at the time
 
03:06:20.929 --> 03:06:20.939 align:start position:0%
of the hearing our view is that that
 
03:06:22.610 --> 03:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
should be changed
 
03:06:24.290 --> 03:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
um to just make clear that once the
 
03:06:26.210 --> 03:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
complaint screening committee determines
 
03:06:27.769 --> 03:06:27.779 align:start position:0%
that there's sufficient evidence to move
 
03:06:30.530 --> 03:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
forward the evidence shall be made
 
03:06:32.330 --> 03:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
public and so it's really just a timing
 
03:06:35.090 --> 03:06:35.100 align:start position:0%
issue it wouldn't create a new category
 
03:06:37.910 --> 03:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
of cases that would be made public it's
 
03:06:40.250 --> 03:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
just designed to one sort of the formal
 
03:06:42.110 --> 03:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
charges are brought and as
 
03:06:44.150 --> 03:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative Platt had suggested the
 
03:06:44.160 --> 03:06:45.469 align:start position:0%
representative Platt had suggested the
the

03:06:45.469 --> 03:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:06:48.530 --> 03:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
um frivolous or legally insufficient
 
03:06:50.090 --> 03:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
charges have been weeded out by the
 
03:06:52.190 --> 03:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
complaint screening committee at that
 
03:06:53.630 --> 03:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
point things could be made public and
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have to wait between the
 
03:06:57.710 --> 03:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
docketing of that of that finding and
 
03:06:59.809 --> 03:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
the hearing itself so that's really just
 
03:07:03.469 --> 03:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
a timing change that we suggest
 
03:07:05.870 --> 03:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
the second change just
 
03:07:09.110 --> 03:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
um is a change to the purpose section
 
03:07:10.790 --> 03:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:07:13.370 --> 03:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
um which is on page nine lines 25
 
03:07:16.370 --> 03:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
through 28 that says it's the perfect of
 
03:07:18.170 --> 03:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the section both to
 
03:07:19.429 --> 03:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
protect the reputation of law
 
03:07:20.870 --> 03:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers from public
 
03:07:22.670 --> 03:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
disclosure of unwarranted complaints
 
03:07:24.889 --> 03:07:24.899 align:start position:0%
against them and to fulfill the public
 
03:07:26.330 --> 03:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
right to know of any action taken
 
03:07:28.490 --> 03:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
against a law enforcement officer when
 
03:07:29.990 --> 03:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
that action is based on a sustained
 
03:07:32.210 --> 03:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
finding misconduct our view is that that
 
03:07:35.389 --> 03:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
purpose section is unnecessary and may
 
03:07:38.389 --> 03:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
have the unintended I think effect of
 
03:07:40.969 --> 03:07:40.979 align:start position:0%
changing the current status quo of right
 
03:07:45.349 --> 03:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
to no laws against local departments uh
 
03:07:46.670 --> 03:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
right to no actions against local
 
03:07:49.849 --> 03:07:49.859 align:start position:0%
departments or other agencies when
 
03:07:52.849 --> 03:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
um there's a an investigation of high
 
03:07:55.370 --> 03:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
public interest but the there's an
 
03:07:57.830 --> 03:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
unsustained finding against an officer
 
03:07:59.990 --> 03:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
right now uh the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
03:08:01.610 --> 03:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the Valley News has the
 
03:08:02.809 --> 03:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
case pending before the New Hampshire
 
03:08:05.870 --> 03:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court uh seeking records into an
 
03:08:08.269 --> 03:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
investigation that ended up ultimately
 
03:08:11.150 --> 03:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
clearing an officer of misconduct but
 
03:08:12.769 --> 03:08:12.779 align:start position:0%
the argument that the trial court found
 
03:08:14.929 --> 03:08:14.939 align:start position:0%
persuasive and that I'm hopeful the New
 
03:08:16.429 --> 03:08:16.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court will recognize
 
03:08:19.429 --> 03:08:19.439 align:start position:0%
on appeal as courts and other states
 
03:08:20.929 --> 03:08:20.939 align:start position:0%
have done is that there's also a public
 
03:08:22.849 --> 03:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
interest in knowing that the
 
03:08:25.969 --> 03:08:25.979 align:start position:0%
investigation is comprehensive
 
03:08:27.830 --> 03:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
um and fair and thorough and I think
 
03:08:29.630 --> 03:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
that that will happen it certainly is
 
03:08:30.950 --> 03:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
our belief that that will happen under
 
03:08:34.250 --> 03:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
the this proposal as passed we just
 
03:08:37.130 --> 03:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
think that this change and removing the
 
03:08:38.269 --> 03:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
statement of purpose and there's one
 
03:08:40.429 --> 03:08:40.439 align:start position:0%
other change to that effect would would
 
03:08:42.889 --> 03:08:42.899 align:start position:0%
remove the possibility of these
 
03:08:44.750 --> 03:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
unintended con um
 
03:08:46.670 --> 03:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
changes to the right to no law then
 
03:08:50.210 --> 03:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
finally our last suggested change and
 
03:08:52.730 --> 03:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
again these are all uh in your inbox and
 
03:08:55.969 --> 03:08:55.979 align:start position:0%
writing is to just make clear that ptsc
 
03:08:55.979 --> 03:08:57.010 align:start position:0%
writing is to just make clear that ptsc
t

03:08:57.010 --> 03:08:57.020 align:start position:0%
t
 
03:08:59.990 --> 03:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
ptsc should maintain a public website
 
03:09:03.710 --> 03:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
that has the reports of sustained
 
03:09:05.809 --> 03:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
findings of misconduct after the process
 
03:09:08.330 --> 03:09:08.340 align:start position:0%
has concluded and that was
 
03:09:10.190 --> 03:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
um a recommendation made by Lee act and
 
03:09:12.290 --> 03:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
it's also consistent with the attorney
 
03:09:13.849 --> 03:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
discipline office for example if you
 
03:09:16.510 --> 03:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
were to go to NH
 
03:09:18.469 --> 03:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
attreg.org that's the website of the
 
03:09:20.510 --> 03:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
attorney discipline office you can look
 
03:09:22.429 --> 03:09:22.439 align:start position:0%
up online and read all of the
 
03:09:24.050 --> 03:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
disciplinary decisions that have been
 
03:09:26.269 --> 03:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
sustained against any lawyer in the
 
03:09:28.550 --> 03:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
state going back like I think like 15
 
03:09:31.849 --> 03:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
years and so those are the three changes
 
03:09:34.190 --> 03:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
that we would put to this committee to
 
03:09:37.130 --> 03:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
ensure our full support for the bill as
 
03:09:38.510 --> 03:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
I said we are already generally
 
03:09:39.950 --> 03:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
supportive those are just some changes
 
03:09:41.870 --> 03:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
that we think could really improve what
 
03:09:44.150 --> 03:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
is a what is a really comprehensive
 
03:09:45.650 --> 03:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
piece of legis isolation that we're
 
03:09:48.170 --> 03:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
pleased and proud to support we also
 
03:09:49.370 --> 03:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
want to thank the other members of the
 
03:09:51.290 --> 03:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
commission who worked with us on this in
 
03:09:53.389 --> 03:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
particular director skippa and Senior
 
03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General Matt
 
03:09:54.960 --> 03:09:56.330 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General Matt
Broadhead

03:09:56.330 --> 03:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
Broadhead
 
03:09:58.730 --> 03:09:58.740 align:start position:0%
um who did just incredible amounts of
 
03:10:00.769 --> 03:10:00.779 align:start position:0%
work to to try to reach consensus on
 
03:10:02.450 --> 03:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
these hard issues
 
03:10:04.190 --> 03:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'm happy to take any
 
03:10:04.200 --> 03:10:05.510 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'm happy to take any
questions

03:10:05.510 --> 03:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:10:07.849 --> 03:10:07.859 align:start position:0%
the chair May inquire and thank you for
 
03:10:10.370 --> 03:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
taking my question you referenced page
 
03:10:13.309 --> 03:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
nine lines 25 to 28. can you explain to
 
03:10:15.650 --> 03:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
the committee how exactly that that
 
03:10:16.910 --> 03:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
would have a negative impact on the
 
03:10:20.330 --> 03:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
right to know laws sure so if I may I'm
 
03:10:22.130 --> 03:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
just calling up my computer to get the
 
03:10:23.990 --> 03:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill so it's
 
03:10:26.750 --> 03:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
um it is that purpose section and it is
 
03:10:30.650 --> 03:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
also uh the language
 
03:10:30.660 --> 03:10:32.389 align:start position:0%
also uh the language
um

03:10:32.389 --> 03:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:35.330 --> 03:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
so our view is that that surplusage in
 
03:10:37.670 --> 03:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
light of the language that says that the
 
03:10:39.349 --> 03:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
hearing shall be conducted in accordance
 
03:10:43.849 --> 03:10:43.859 align:start position:0%
with RSA 106 L 5 Roman 3 which generally
 
03:10:46.730 --> 03:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:48.469 --> 03:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
and so the Surplus which I think could
 
03:10:50.269 --> 03:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
just be read to
 
03:10:50.279 --> 03:10:51.590 align:start position:0%
just be read to
um

03:10:51.590 --> 03:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:53.690 --> 03:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
the direct answer to your question Mr
 
03:10:56.690 --> 03:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
chairman is that public records requests
 
03:10:58.550 --> 03:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
are generally interpreted consistent
 
03:11:00.110 --> 03:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
with the preamble to the right to know
 
03:11:02.210 --> 03:11:02.220 align:start position:0%
statute which provides that open
 
03:11:04.070 --> 03:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
government is the foundation of
 
03:11:06.349 --> 03:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
democracy and so the case law that has
 
03:11:09.050 --> 03:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
evolved in those cases is that documents
 
03:11:10.730 --> 03:11:10.740 align:start position:0%
in the possession of a public body are
 
03:11:12.349 --> 03:11:12.359 align:start position:0%
presumed to be public in accordance with
 
03:11:15.830 --> 03:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
that purpose and the burden rests on the
 
03:11:17.929 --> 03:11:17.939 align:start position:0%
entity-resisting disclosure to prove
 
03:11:19.429 --> 03:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
that a document is exempt from the right
 
03:11:21.650 --> 03:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
to no law putting a different purpose
 
03:11:24.889 --> 03:11:24.899 align:start position:0%
here could sort of change the the I
 
03:11:26.929 --> 03:11:26.939 align:start position:0%
think the Court's potentially I don't
 
03:11:28.250 --> 03:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
know if it would but it's possible and
 
03:11:29.450 --> 03:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
that's why we're suggesting it be
 
03:11:32.630 --> 03:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
removed could change the underpaid the
 
03:11:34.309 --> 03:11:34.319 align:start position:0%
underpinnings of that presumption of
 
03:11:34.319 --> 03:11:39.349 align:start position:0%
underpinnings of that presumption of
openness

03:11:39.349 --> 03:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:41.870 --> 03:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative testerman
 
03:11:45.050 --> 03:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
um you've made several suggestions and
 
03:11:47.750 --> 03:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm assuming most of them are fairly
 
03:11:50.269 --> 03:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
good you're not the only one who's come
 
03:11:52.490 --> 03:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
up to the stable who's made several
 
03:11:57.290 --> 03:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:00.050 --> 03:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
I don't yeah I'll leave it up to the the
 
03:12:02.690 --> 03:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
chair to write this decision but
 
03:12:05.210 --> 03:12:05.220 align:start position:0%
we need these things to come back to us
 
03:12:08.030 --> 03:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
as one document
 
03:12:11.929 --> 03:12:11.939 align:start position:0%
you know that that you all agree to uh
 
03:12:14.750 --> 03:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
rather than us try to represent them
 
03:12:17.389 --> 03:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
Testament my okay my question is we
 
03:12:19.309 --> 03:12:19.319 align:start position:0%
don't debate the witness we ask
 
03:12:21.950 --> 03:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
questions okay my question is have you
 
03:12:23.809 --> 03:12:23.819 align:start position:0%
got a single document of all these
 
03:12:23.819 --> 03:12:24.950 align:start position:0%
got a single document of all these
changes

03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
changes
 
03:12:29.210 --> 03:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
that's just yours not just ours no sir
 
03:12:32.090 --> 03:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
um uh As I understood it there was a
 
03:12:34.309 --> 03:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
change proposed from The Trial Lawyers
 
03:12:36.230 --> 03:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
there was a small housekeeping change
 
03:12:38.210 --> 03:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
proposed from
 
03:12:40.130 --> 03:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
um commissioner skippa which I think has
 
03:12:42.170 --> 03:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
been read into the record of then our
 
03:12:44.330 --> 03:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
changes were emailed to you but but the
 
03:12:49.130 --> 03:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:51.050 --> 03:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
but if I if I may I'm sorry
 
03:12:53.210 --> 03:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
representative testerman
 
03:12:54.950 --> 03:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
um I will say that a ton of work has
 
03:12:57.469 --> 03:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
been reached into into
 
03:12:59.150 --> 03:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
um working on this product and if you
 
03:13:01.309 --> 03:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
had been at the commission meetings when
 
03:13:03.050 --> 03:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
they started you would see how far apart
 
03:13:04.969 --> 03:13:04.979 align:start position:0%
everyone has come and it's our belief
 
03:13:04.979 --> 03:13:06.590 align:start position:0%
everyone has come and it's our belief
that

03:13:06.590 --> 03:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:13:08.570 --> 03:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
um that that
 
03:13:10.490 --> 03:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
a ton of work and compromise has been
 
03:13:12.050 --> 03:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
made to reach a final product and that
 
03:13:14.210 --> 03:13:14.220 align:start position:0%
this is ready for prime time yeah my
 
03:13:18.950 --> 03:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
question is I is it's not my job
 
03:13:20.870 --> 03:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
try to undo those
 
03:13:24.830 --> 03:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
and I and I'm asking you
 
03:13:26.290 --> 03:13:26.300 align:start position:0%
to come forward
 
03:13:29.389 --> 03:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
representative testman
 
03:13:32.030 --> 03:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
it has to be a question and I think we
 
03:13:34.190 --> 03:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
the committee all we all prefer bills
 
03:13:36.530 --> 03:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
arrive here in perfect shape it makes
 
03:13:38.630 --> 03:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
our makes our responsibility easier but
 
03:13:39.830 --> 03:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't always happen as we can
 
03:13:41.210 --> 03:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
tell but we don't need to discuss that
 
03:13:44.690 --> 03:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
anymore one question I I do do really
 
03:13:44.700 --> 03:13:45.530 align:start position:0%
anymore one question I I do do really
have

03:13:45.530 --> 03:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:13:49.070 --> 03:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
are all the suggestions you you've come
 
03:13:51.230 --> 03:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
forward with for changes have they been
 
03:13:53.389 --> 03:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
vetted with the rest of your committee I
 
03:13:56.150 --> 03:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
think the answer to that is probably no
 
03:13:57.230 --> 03:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
um we've shared them with the Attorney
 
03:13:58.550 --> 03:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
General's office but they haven't been
 
03:14:05.210 --> 03:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:07.250 --> 03:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
representative Byrd
 
03:14:08.990 --> 03:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:14:11.570 --> 03:14:11.580 align:start position:0%

it got shut off sorry uh
 
03:14:28.370 --> 03:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
page four line 16 to 18 you spoke of
 
03:14:34.790 --> 03:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:34.800 --> 03:14:39.710 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:14:39.710 --> 03:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:42.950 --> 03:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
is your mic on oh my mic had shut off I
 
03:14:45.170 --> 03:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
apologize for that it should be on now
 
03:14:47.570 --> 03:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
um I was not on the study commission Mr
 
03:14:49.190 --> 03:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
lascaz was the representative from the
 
03:14:50.809 --> 03:14:50.819 align:start position:0%
ACLU of New Hampshire but what I
 
03:14:53.090 --> 03:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
understand him to be saying is that the
 
03:14:54.349 --> 03:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
intent of
 
03:14:57.110 --> 03:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
this language was to prohibit a
 
03:14:59.630 --> 03:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
representative of like a group of
 
03:15:00.950 --> 03:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
lawyers like there wouldn't be a
 
03:15:02.330 --> 03:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
representative from the bar or the
 
03:15:05.030 --> 03:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
criminal defense attorneys Association I
 
03:15:07.070 --> 03:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
agree that the language as currently
 
03:15:09.230 --> 03:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
written probably does prohibit any
 
03:15:10.790 --> 03:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
lawyer from serving on the commission
 
03:15:13.309 --> 03:15:13.319 align:start position:0%
and from Mr lascaze I understand that
 
03:15:16.910 --> 03:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
that to be not in keeping with
 
03:15:19.070 --> 03:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
um the what the recommendation intended
 
03:15:20.809 --> 03:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
so perhaps there should be a change to
 
03:15:23.450 --> 03:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
that I will leave it to to to
 
03:15:23.460 --> 03:15:23.990 align:start position:0%
that I will leave it to to to
um

03:15:23.990 --> 03:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:26.210 --> 03:15:26.220 align:start position:0%
to director skippa and to assistant
 
03:15:27.590 --> 03:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
senior Assistant Attorney General
 
03:15:29.090 --> 03:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
Broadhead to confirm that that's their
 
03:15:31.670 --> 03:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
understanding too yeah
 
03:15:34.730 --> 03:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
follow well you know yeah I never got to
 
03:15:36.110 --> 03:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
my question but so what the question is
 
03:15:37.610 --> 03:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
I apologize
 
03:15:37.620 --> 03:15:40.070 align:start position:0%
I apologize
um

03:15:40.070 --> 03:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:44.990 --> 03:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
in Goffstown we have you cannot be a
 
03:15:47.389 --> 03:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
policeman fireman to be a segment
 
03:15:50.929 --> 03:15:50.939 align:start position:0%
but we do have a retired fireman
 
03:15:53.570 --> 03:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
and so what my concern was is and I
 
03:15:55.309 --> 03:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
think you've cleared it up and and so if
 
03:15:58.309 --> 03:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
you can explain it again just briefly um
 
03:16:00.769 --> 03:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
you know I wouldn't want that with this
 
03:16:03.769 --> 03:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
if you're a retired lawyer
 
03:16:07.610 --> 03:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh policeman a judge you know it's it
 
03:16:09.530 --> 03:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
you have that blood for the rest of your
 
03:16:12.230 --> 03:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
life so you're always going to side with
 
03:16:12.240 --> 03:16:13.250 align:start position:0%
life so you're always going to side with
that

03:16:13.250 --> 03:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:16.130 --> 03:16:16.140 align:start position:0%
you know I don't think our retired
 
03:16:19.010 --> 03:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh firemen should be on the select board
 
03:16:20.929 --> 03:16:20.939 align:start position:0%
because he always votes for that so I'm
 
03:16:23.269 --> 03:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
just curious if so you're telling me
 
03:16:23.279 --> 03:16:24.230 align:start position:0%
just curious if so you're telling me
that

03:16:24.230 --> 03:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:26.809 --> 03:16:26.819 align:start position:0%
currently the way this is written they
 
03:16:29.510 --> 03:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
cannot serve
 
03:16:32.570 --> 03:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
yes which I support so yes the answer to
 
03:16:34.849 --> 03:16:34.859 align:start position:0%
answer your question yes the way this is
 
03:16:36.650 --> 03:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
written they would not be able to
 
03:16:39.410 --> 03:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
support but thank you so what this goes
 
03:16:43.070 --> 03:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
back to addressing them on line 11 it
 
03:16:45.110 --> 03:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
says a law enforcement officer of a town
 
03:16:46.730 --> 03:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
or city employed at a rank below
 
03:16:49.250 --> 03:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant originally
 
03:16:51.590 --> 03:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
um that that language had stated that it
 
03:16:53.630 --> 03:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
would be a representative of a specific
 
03:16:57.830 --> 03:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
police Union and we had discussions on
 
03:17:00.050 --> 03:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
that where they could see that because
 
03:17:02.809 --> 03:17:02.819 align:start position:0%
of the intent of this overall agency is
 
03:17:04.730 --> 03:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
to be independent and neutral and
 
03:17:04.740 --> 03:17:05.990 align:start position:0%
to be independent and neutral and
objective

03:17:05.990 --> 03:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
objective
 
03:17:07.910 --> 03:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
the public and the community wouldn't
 
03:17:10.309 --> 03:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
see it as being objective or independent
 
03:17:12.650 --> 03:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
if you have a representative that
 
03:17:15.170 --> 03:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
sitting there that is that represents an
 
03:17:17.630 --> 03:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
organization or an advocacy group that's
 
03:17:19.429 --> 03:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
what it was it wasn't the fact that we
 
03:17:22.490 --> 03:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
that there should be a police officer on
 
03:17:25.429 --> 03:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
this Council right that can rep that can
 
03:17:27.590 --> 03:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
bring that perspective of
 
03:17:29.450 --> 03:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
of a police officer that's not that's
 
03:17:31.670 --> 03:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
not that doesn't have rank that can go
 
03:17:33.530 --> 03:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
back to other police officers to be like
 
03:17:34.849 --> 03:17:34.859 align:start position:0%
hey this is what's coming down the line
 
03:17:36.230 --> 03:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
this is what happened but he's not
 
03:17:38.690 --> 03:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
representing a police Union representing
 
03:17:40.790 --> 03:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
a police Union on the council is
 
03:17:42.469 --> 03:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
different than having a police officer
 
03:17:44.269 --> 03:17:44.279 align:start position:0%
there and so it was with that same
 
03:17:46.550 --> 03:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
mindset that it was like you can have an
 
03:17:48.349 --> 03:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
individual who's a lawyer or a judge but
 
03:17:50.690 --> 03:17:50.700 align:start position:0%
they're not there representing
 
03:17:53.269 --> 03:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
um a specific community group where that
 
03:17:56.750 --> 03:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
is what they advocate for yeah but Mr
 
03:17:58.969 --> 03:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
chairman if I may yes yeah uh thank you
 
03:18:01.910 --> 03:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
but but the way this is written they
 
03:18:04.790 --> 03:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
cannot if they are a lawyer policeman or
 
03:18:07.429 --> 03:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
judge be part of that for in line 16
 
03:18:10.250 --> 03:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
four of the public members correct okay
 
03:18:12.050 --> 03:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
yep that's perfect that's what I want
 
03:18:15.650 --> 03:18:15.660 align:start position:0%

this time the chair will recognize
 
04:12:23.929 --> 04:12:23.939 align:start position:0%
representative testerman to make a

04:12:30.349 --> 04:12:30.359 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a motion uh
 
04:12:35.349 --> 04:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:39.650 --> 04:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
2022.0006 for house bill 1475. is there
 
04:12:42.530 --> 04:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
second I'll second that motion motioned

do I have to pass an offer an amendment
 
04:12:46.130 --> 04:12:46.140 align:start position:0%

representative Greene
 
04:12:50.870 --> 04:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative testman do you wish to
 
04:12:52.790 --> 04:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
speak to your emotion
 
04:12:56.450 --> 04:12:56.460 align:start position:0%
just very quickly uh it basically cleans
 
04:13:00.530 --> 04:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
up uh some words and allows the the
 
04:13:04.550 --> 04:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
ability of the liquor people to uh
 
04:13:22.370 --> 04:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:24.729 --> 04:13:24.739 align:start position:0%
I don't have it
 
04:13:28.490 --> 04:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
representative borne you recognize
 
04:13:30.530 --> 04:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:13:34.490 --> 04:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
I want to oppose the amendment I am not
 
04:13:36.189 --> 04:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
in favor of it because it basically
 
04:13:40.250 --> 04:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
gives Liquor Commission
 
04:13:42.590 --> 04:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
Law Officers
 
04:13:46.189 --> 04:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
the leeway to enforce all state laws
 
04:13:50.150 --> 04:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
across all jurisdictions uh
 
04:13:54.650 --> 04:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
and the original Bill limited uh
 
04:13:58.729 --> 04:13:58.739 align:start position:0%
those abilities to only three conditions
 
04:14:01.130 --> 04:14:01.140 align:start position:0%
and I
 
04:14:05.630 --> 04:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
I like the idea of limiting those uh law
 
04:14:08.689 --> 04:14:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:14.349 --> 04:14:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:18.110 --> 04:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:20.689 --> 04:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair
 
04:14:25.429 --> 04:14:25.439 align:start position:0%
I I uh specifically asked to ask
 
04:14:27.110 --> 04:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh chief
 
04:14:29.809 --> 04:14:29.819 align:start position:0%
I'm a Ganon gainian
 
04:14:32.630 --> 04:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
and he said
 
04:14:35.750 --> 04:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
they are it's that's already in the law
 
04:14:38.570 --> 04:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
the the amendment or the bill
 
04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
does not give
 
04:14:44.269 --> 04:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:46.969 --> 04:14:46.979 align:start position:0%
police Authority
 
04:14:50.210 --> 04:14:50.220 align:start position:0%
they already have
 
04:14:51.889 --> 04:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
police authorities just like a state
 
04:14:51.899 --> 04:14:52.910 align:start position:0%
police authorities just like a state
police

04:14:52.910 --> 04:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
police
 
04:14:56.090 --> 04:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
in the incumbent law
 
04:14:59.389 --> 04:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
so so it's not I don't like that I'm
 
04:15:02.090 --> 04:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
surprised that that exists
 
04:15:02.100 --> 04:15:03.469 align:start position:0%
surprised that that exists
but

04:15:03.469 --> 04:15:03.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:15:05.389 --> 04:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
this this amendment is not giving them
 
04:15:07.309 --> 04:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
that Authority they already have it if
 
04:15:11.090 --> 04:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
if we kill both of these they still have
 
04:15:12.889 --> 04:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
police Authority throughout the state
 
04:15:14.689 --> 04:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
representative boarding May respond to
 
04:15:18.950 --> 04:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
that thank you uh the bill as presented
 
04:15:22.490 --> 04:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
to us does limit The Liquor Commission
 
04:15:24.490 --> 04:15:24.500 align:start position:0%
uh enforcement
 
04:15:30.590 --> 04:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:35.389 --> 04:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
if we adopt the amendment it goes back
 
04:15:38.330 --> 04:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
to what it is today and regardless of
 
04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not the liquor commissioner
 
04:15:44.990 --> 04:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
says that the protocols are in place now
 
04:15:47.689 --> 04:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
that will basically make them operate
 
04:15:50.929 --> 04:15:50.939 align:start position:0%
like the event the bill as presented to
 
04:15:50.939 --> 04:15:51.830 align:start position:0%
like the event the bill as presented to
us

04:15:51.830 --> 04:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:15:54.530 --> 04:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
those Protocols are subject to change at
 
04:15:57.290 --> 04:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
the willm of the Liquor Commission
 
04:16:02.809 --> 04:16:02.819 align:start position:0%
so I would like to see in law uh
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
them have the authority that they are
 
04:16:09.590 --> 04:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
say they're doing today
 
04:16:14.269 --> 04:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
so I am going to oppose this amendment
 
04:16:16.250 --> 04:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:16:18.650 --> 04:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify there
 
04:16:20.990 --> 04:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
under existing law there are some rules
 
04:16:23.929 --> 04:16:23.939 align:start position:0%
that are in policies that the Liquor
 
04:16:26.450 --> 04:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
Commission has for its invest its liquor
 
04:16:28.969 --> 04:16:28.979 align:start position:0%
investigators it does limit the scope of
 
04:16:31.729 --> 04:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
the authority but the underlying bill
 
04:16:34.010 --> 04:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
would have done although yes through an
 
04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
act of legislation we could supersede
 
04:16:37.429 --> 04:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
those rules or
 
04:16:40.130 --> 04:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
the problem is the way as written if
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
let's say there was an armed robbery
 
04:16:45.170 --> 04:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
at a convenience store that didn't have
 
04:16:46.130 --> 04:16:46.140 align:start position:0%
any liquor
 
04:16:49.729 --> 04:16:49.739 align:start position:0%
well the liquor investigator
 
04:16:51.769 --> 04:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
Would we not have the authority to
 
04:16:51.779 --> 04:16:53.450 align:start position:0%
Would we not have the authority to
intervene

04:16:53.450 --> 04:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
intervene
 
04:16:54.889 --> 04:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
And when they see what is otherwise a
 
04:16:56.510 --> 04:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
violent criminal act they could also
 
04:17:00.530 --> 04:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
walk by a issue of the domestic violence
 
04:17:03.050 --> 04:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
situation and have no
 
04:17:06.530 --> 04:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
uh jurisdiction or authority to act so
 
04:17:08.689 --> 04:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
the underlying Bill although well
 
04:17:11.349 --> 04:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
intended to me perhaps narrow the
 
04:17:13.010 --> 04:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
authority of the of a liquor
 
04:17:15.170 --> 04:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
investigator it may went too far when
 
04:17:17.689 --> 04:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
many of the rules are and procedures for
 
04:17:19.610 --> 04:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
the liquor investigators already in
 
04:17:21.469 --> 04:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
place so what this is doing
 
04:17:23.150 --> 04:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
the primary purpose of what the
 
04:17:25.610 --> 04:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
amendment is is just changing
 
04:17:27.889 --> 04:17:27.899 align:start position:0%
the language that references Authority
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
similar to that of the county sheriff
 
04:17:30.889 --> 04:17:30.899 align:start position:0%
because that's a constitutionally
 
04:17:33.290 --> 04:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
elected position and just changing the
 
04:17:34.729 --> 04:17:34.739 align:start position:0%
Statewide jurisdiction which is more of
 
04:17:36.170 --> 04:17:36.180 align:start position:0%
a housekeeping matter
 
04:17:39.290 --> 04:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
so I understand the point being made but
 
04:17:41.630 --> 04:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
by going down that road we are would be
 
04:17:43.070 --> 04:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
needing to
 
04:17:45.110 --> 04:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
understand we are then narrowing what
 
04:17:46.729 --> 04:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
they can do and at when acting in
 
04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:51.349 --> 04:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative borne
 
04:17:52.809 --> 04:17:52.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:17:55.269 --> 04:17:55.279 align:start position:0%
and if you will look at the original
 
04:17:58.729 --> 04:17:58.739 align:start position:0%
bill you see that liquor investigators
 
04:18:01.010 --> 04:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
shall have limited powers and enforce
 
04:18:02.389 --> 04:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
the following
 
04:18:04.309 --> 04:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
these are actually three different cases
 
04:18:07.250 --> 04:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
the first one being other statues of
 
04:18:11.870 --> 04:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
criminal law only to extend or to stop
 
04:18:14.450 --> 04:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
the immediate threat of bodily injury
 
04:18:17.570 --> 04:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
our death if immediate action is not
 
04:18:20.090 --> 04:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
taken so the example that you just
 
04:18:22.670 --> 04:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
presented to us they now
 
04:18:26.510 --> 04:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
under the the bill as it presented to us
 
04:18:29.510 --> 04:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
they would have that Authority
 
04:18:33.410 --> 04:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
but pointing if we go
 
04:18:36.410 --> 04:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
defeat the bill or overrided with this
 
04:18:36.420 --> 04:18:37.790 align:start position:0%
defeat the bill or overrided with this
amendment

04:18:37.790 --> 04:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:18:40.370 --> 04:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
the liquor investigators would have the
 
04:18:43.010 --> 04:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
authority to uh
 
04:18:47.090 --> 04:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
stop people if they run a stop sign
 
04:18:48.530 --> 04:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
red light
 
04:18:51.110 --> 04:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
or even cross a yellow line
 
04:18:55.309 --> 04:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
so I have to say I don't want my my
 
04:18:58.910 --> 04:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
liquor investigators pursuing a general
 
04:19:03.050 --> 04:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
crime I want them to concentrate on a
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
liquor issues
 
04:19:07.790 --> 04:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
I believe that that example is against
 
04:19:09.950 --> 04:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
the policy of the liquor
 
04:19:09.960 --> 04:19:12.769 align:start position:0%
the policy of the liquor
investigators

04:19:12.769 --> 04:19:12.779 align:start position:0%
investigators
 
04:19:14.929 --> 04:19:14.939 align:start position:0%
specifically making stops for civil
 
04:19:14.939 --> 04:19:16.429 align:start position:0%
specifically making stops for civil
infractions

04:19:16.429 --> 04:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
infractions
 
04:19:19.130 --> 04:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
I understand that you are talking about
 
04:19:22.429 --> 04:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
policy within the Liquor Commission but
 
04:19:25.189 --> 04:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
policy within the Liquor Commission
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
are is changeable by The Liquor
 
04:19:29.990 --> 04:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
Commission itself
 
04:19:34.010 --> 04:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
this it would be statute driven and they
 
04:19:35.389 --> 04:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
could only
 
04:19:38.330 --> 04:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
exert that Authority if we gave them
 
04:19:40.849 --> 04:19:40.859 align:start position:0%
additional Authority
 
04:19:40.859 --> 04:19:42.229 align:start position:0%
additional Authority
so

04:19:42.229 --> 04:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:19:45.410 --> 04:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
I am going to still vote against the
 
04:19:48.830 --> 04:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
amendment I'd like the bill as presented
 
04:19:50.150 --> 04:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
to us
 
04:19:51.650 --> 04:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:19:56.450 --> 04:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
I have a couple of questions based just
 
04:20:03.889 --> 04:20:03.899 align:start position:0%
to clarify maybe your explanation of The
 
04:20:05.330 --> 04:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission and what
 
04:20:05.340 --> 04:20:09.170 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission and what
representative

04:20:09.170 --> 04:20:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:11.870 --> 04:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
was just talking about
 
04:20:15.050 --> 04:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
these it appears that one two and three
 
04:20:19.429 --> 04:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
they in fact do limit the abilities of
 
04:20:21.769 --> 04:20:21.779 align:start position:0%
the liquid commissioners
 
04:20:24.830 --> 04:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
from what they are now is that would
 
04:20:26.809 --> 04:20:26.819 align:start position:0%
that be correct or not
 
04:20:29.330 --> 04:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
it it does the point that I was making
 
04:20:31.429 --> 04:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
is is that there are several rules in
 
04:20:33.650 --> 04:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
place for liquor investigators to follow
 
04:20:34.969 --> 04:20:34.979 align:start position:0%
and I'm just
 
04:20:38.630 --> 04:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
suggesting as to the committee that
 
04:20:40.790 --> 04:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps reviewing all those rules in
 
04:20:42.590 --> 04:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
detail before we start taking away
 
04:20:44.210 --> 04:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
certain authorities it may already be
 
04:20:47.090 --> 04:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
the case with involving the rules
 
04:20:49.070 --> 04:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
because all I'm suggesting all right
 
04:20:51.170 --> 04:20:51.180 align:start position:0%
this is the primary purpose
 
04:20:54.170 --> 04:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
is from the sponsor of the bill was to
 
04:20:56.990 --> 04:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
Simply clarify the language that was
 
04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
really referencing the county sheriff
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
where it shouldn't have been I I
 
04:21:03.590 --> 04:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
understand that also and I think he may
 
04:21:04.809 --> 04:21:04.819 align:start position:0%
have in
 
04:21:07.370 --> 04:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
misunderstood how limiting these are so
 
04:21:09.950 --> 04:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
it appears like in section one
 
04:21:13.550 --> 04:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
that on on if there enforces another
 
04:21:16.849 --> 04:21:16.859 align:start position:0%
statute but only to stop immediate
 
04:21:19.070 --> 04:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
threat of bodily injury or death is a
 
04:21:21.650 --> 04:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
pretty severe limitation
 
04:21:24.830 --> 04:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
and I I wouldn't agree with that kind of
 
04:21:26.510 --> 04:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
limitation I just wanted to make sure
 
04:21:28.849 --> 04:21:28.859 align:start position:0%
that it was a limitation as I understand
 
04:21:28.859 --> 04:21:29.809 align:start position:0%
that it was a limitation as I understand
it

04:21:29.809 --> 04:21:29.819 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:21:31.790 --> 04:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
well I'll give you an example if
 
04:21:33.889 --> 04:21:33.899 align:start position:0%
someone's breaking into a house or a
 
04:21:36.710 --> 04:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
store that the store is closed there's
 
04:21:38.809 --> 04:21:38.819 align:start position:0%
no real threat of bodily injury right
 
04:21:41.030 --> 04:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
but a liquor investigator is driving by
 
04:21:43.250 --> 04:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
sees it happening they would have no
 
04:21:44.570 --> 04:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
authority to act
 
04:21:47.150 --> 04:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
they are alarm there are otherwise a law
 
04:21:48.410 --> 04:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer who went through
 
04:21:50.870 --> 04:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
same training as a state trooper but
 
04:21:53.689 --> 04:21:53.699 align:start position:0%
because we passed this bill as
 
04:21:55.550 --> 04:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
originally filed they would have no
 
04:21:57.110 --> 04:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
authority to act in that case because
 
04:21:59.210 --> 04:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
there's no threat to any bodily injury
 
04:22:00.710 --> 04:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
and they would have to get permission
 
04:22:03.889 --> 04:22:03.899 align:start position:0%
from local offices which by the way in a
 
04:22:05.030 --> 04:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
scenario like that they're likely going
 
04:22:07.490 --> 04:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
to call it in in local offices would
 
04:22:09.349 --> 04:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
also respond to it but
 
04:22:10.550 --> 04:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
they would have to wait and get
 
04:22:12.650 --> 04:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
permission first that's that's the
 
04:22:12.660 --> 04:22:13.490 align:start position:0%
permission first that's that's the
difference

04:22:13.490 --> 04:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
difference
 
04:22:17.389 --> 04:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
and my concern is that they are officers
 
04:22:20.269 --> 04:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
I assume they're armed I assume that
 
04:22:21.889 --> 04:22:21.899 align:start position:0%
they're well that they've been well
 
04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
trained in in dealing with those other
 
04:22:28.790 --> 04:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
statues I I personally would not agree
 
04:22:32.269 --> 04:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
with that limitation on enforcing
 
04:22:32.279 --> 04:22:34.490 align:start position:0%
with that limitation on enforcing
statutes

04:22:34.490 --> 04:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
04:22:35.990 --> 04:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:22:44.349 --> 04:22:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:46.550 --> 04:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
well we were talking about the amendment
 
04:22:48.670 --> 04:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
but it's very clear here that the liquor
 
04:22:51.170 --> 04:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
investigators shall have statewide
 
04:22:53.809 --> 04:22:53.819 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction with reference to
 
04:22:57.110 --> 04:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement of all laws either in
 
04:23:00.710 --> 04:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
cooperation with or independently of the
 
04:23:03.469 --> 04:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
offices of any County or town that's
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
pretty heavy
 
04:23:07.610 --> 04:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
and I so for me I would definitely be
 
04:23:09.950 --> 04:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
against this amendment
 
04:23:12.290 --> 04:23:12.300 align:start position:0%
and and if they want to be policemen
 
04:23:13.610 --> 04:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
then they should
 
04:23:16.790 --> 04:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
go to the academy for police they do go
 
04:23:18.590 --> 04:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
to the academy they don't get the full
 
04:23:20.929 --> 04:23:20.939 align:start position:0%
police they get a partial a portion of
 
04:23:24.469 --> 04:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
it or based on alcohol
 
04:23:26.929 --> 04:23:26.939 align:start position:0%
so I believe the representative from
 
04:23:29.210 --> 04:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
representative true said this sorry I
 
04:23:30.710 --> 04:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
forgot you tell him
 
04:23:32.870 --> 04:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
the representative true said this that
 
04:23:35.570 --> 04:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
they already have the Statewide
 
04:23:38.269 --> 04:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that's an existing law the
 
04:23:40.490 --> 04:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
issue with the existing law is not what
 
04:23:43.010 --> 04:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
the the bills actually addressing it's
 
04:23:45.170 --> 04:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
it's housekeeping the language the
 
04:23:48.110 --> 04:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
concern was was again the constitutional
 
04:23:50.510 --> 04:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
appointed position of a sheriff is
 
04:23:52.929 --> 04:23:52.939 align:start position:0%
elected so the reference in elected
 
04:23:55.189 --> 04:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
official they didn't find was
 
04:23:56.630 --> 04:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate in the changing the language
 
04:23:59.090 --> 04:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
to say Statewide jurisdiction
 
04:24:01.370 --> 04:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
by saying you have the jurisdiction of
 
04:24:03.950 --> 04:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
every County Sheriff it's what I believe
 
04:24:05.870 --> 04:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
the original intent was it just this
 
04:24:07.429 --> 04:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
clarifies that
 
04:24:09.170 --> 04:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
so whether
 
04:24:11.150 --> 04:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
we want to discuss the the you know
 
04:24:12.769 --> 04:24:12.779 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of liquor enforcement
 
04:24:14.750 --> 04:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
another day that's just not what this
 
04:24:16.670 --> 04:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
bill is intended to do at least what the
 
04:24:17.750 --> 04:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
amendment would do
 
04:24:19.790 --> 04:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative Welch
 
04:24:22.550 --> 04:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
yes uh the the amendment
 
04:24:25.849 --> 04:24:25.859 align:start position:0%
changes none of their duties at all it
 
04:24:28.370 --> 04:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
just changes where their Authority comes
 
04:24:30.590 --> 04:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
from it doesn't come from the the
 
04:24:30.600 --> 04:24:31.790 align:start position:0%
from it doesn't come from the the
sheriff's

04:24:31.790 --> 04:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
sheriff's
 
04:24:36.110 --> 04:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:37.610 --> 04:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
and there's to me it's a simple
 
04:24:39.769 --> 04:24:39.779 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I and I think the
 
04:24:43.670 --> 04:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:45.830 --> 04:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
this time the matter will now be put to
 
04:24:48.769 --> 04:24:48.779 align:start position:0%
question if you are in support of
 
04:24:53.210 --> 04:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:55.969 --> 04:24:55.979 align:start position:0%

Testament

04:28:20.510 --> 04:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:23.090 --> 04:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
representative Roy you're recognized
 
04:28:26.030 --> 04:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um I just wanted to address a
 
04:28:26.040 --> 04:28:26.750 align:start position:0%
thank you um I just wanted to address a
um

04:28:26.750 --> 04:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:28.250 --> 04:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
representative gathright's question
 
04:28:30.370 --> 04:28:30.380 align:start position:0%
about um I too had the concerns
 
04:28:33.889 --> 04:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
regarding the um Statewide powers of all
 
04:28:36.229 --> 04:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
laws and then I went back and I looked
 
04:28:38.389 --> 04:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
at the actual statute as it exists now
 
04:28:40.729 --> 04:28:40.739 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what it says they
 
04:28:43.010 --> 04:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
have power over all laws except for
 
04:28:45.349 --> 04:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
they're listed as sheriffs versus
 
04:28:47.389 --> 04:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
Statewide authorities so the only thing
 
04:28:49.550 --> 04:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
liquid said would be changed
 
04:28:51.050 --> 04:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
we're not giving them any more power
 
04:28:53.450 --> 04:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
than they already have with this
 
04:28:59.030 --> 04:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:00.950 --> 04:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative board name
 
04:29:00.960 --> 04:29:02.750 align:start position:0%
representative board name
sure

04:29:02.750 --> 04:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:29:07.610 --> 04:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
I agree that the bill as we now have
 
04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
amended is an improvement over present
 
04:29:11.760 --> 04:29:12.950 align:start position:0%
amended is an improvement over present
law

04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:29:17.330 --> 04:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
but I do and I will support it but I do
 
04:29:20.090 --> 04:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
realize you have to realize that the
 
04:29:23.450 --> 04:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
bill as it was presented to us did limit
 
04:29:27.070 --> 04:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
the powers of the Liquor Commission
 
04:29:30.050 --> 04:29:30.060 align:start position:0%
investigators and I thought that that
 
04:29:33.229 --> 04:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
was a great idea that is what they say
 
04:29:35.929 --> 04:29:35.939 align:start position:0%
today that they do
 
04:29:39.290 --> 04:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
so I think that that bill is a
 
04:29:43.849 --> 04:29:43.859 align:start position:0%
reflection of what is present in the Now
 
04:29:47.750 --> 04:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission but those those
 
04:29:50.750 --> 04:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
Protocols are subject to change by
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
whoever becomes the next liquor
 
04:29:53.040 --> 04:29:54.649 align:start position:0%
whoever becomes the next liquor
commissioner

04:29:54.649 --> 04:29:54.659 align:start position:0%

04:29:58.790 --> 04:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:01.189 --> 04:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
at this time the matter will now with
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
the question if you were in support of
 
04:30:04.849 --> 04:30:04.859 align:start position:0%

04:30:06.469 --> 04:30:06.479 align:start position:0%

Mr chair
 
04:31:33.710 --> 04:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative true you recognize for
 
04:31:34.910 --> 04:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
your point of order
 
04:31:36.530 --> 04:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
we had a problem
 
04:31:38.630 --> 04:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
with this situation about people being
 
04:31:41.330 --> 04:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
absent in the past
 
04:31:44.090 --> 04:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
I don't think we called the lull like we
 
04:31:46.070 --> 04:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
normally call the role
 
04:31:49.010 --> 04:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
we don't call the bowl
 
04:31:53.450 --> 04:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh pandalacas Ahern uh Amanda bold
 
04:31:55.370 --> 04:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
that's not how we
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative true I I your point of
 
04:31:58.849 --> 04:31:58.859 align:start position:0%
order is well taken
 
04:32:02.030 --> 04:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh is there I would say one
 
04:32:03.830 --> 04:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
the role has already been called and the
 
04:32:05.149 --> 04:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
vote's completed so the point of order
 
04:32:06.830 --> 04:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
needs to be would have been need to be
 
04:32:07.969 --> 04:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
made right away
 
04:32:07.979 --> 04:32:09.590 align:start position:0%
made right away
and

04:32:09.590 --> 04:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
understanding that the regular clerk is
 
04:32:15.530 --> 04:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
not here today I just would ask if some
 
04:32:18.050 --> 04:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
leeway with with representative Harry
 
04:32:22.550 --> 04:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
Catherine who I asked her to fill in
 
04:32:22.560 --> 04:32:23.630 align:start position:0%
Catherine who I asked her to fill in
in

04:32:23.630 --> 04:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:32:26.269 --> 04:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
I I'm thankful that you did that
 
04:32:28.550 --> 04:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
I understand that uh I mean I made the
 
04:32:39.610 --> 04:32:39.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
and procedures of this committee
 
04:32:45.229 --> 04:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
uh if you don't call the roll correctly
 
04:32:47.090 --> 04:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
you redo it
 
04:32:54.229 --> 04:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:57.889 --> 04:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
and what was incorrect about the role
 
04:33:03.710 --> 04:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:05.929 --> 04:33:05.939 align:start position:0%
the point you you are making is well
 
04:33:08.750 --> 04:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
taken if I'm going to rule that the way
 
04:33:12.051 --> 04:33:12.061 align:start position:0%
the role was was called was was correct
 
04:33:13.490 --> 04:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
and if you wish to challenge a ruling
 
04:33:40.609 --> 04:33:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:40.619 --> 04:33:48.650 align:start position:0%
 
much

04:33:48.650 --> 04:33:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:50.510 --> 04:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
I could have representative true fill in
 
04:33:52.070 --> 04:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
for the clerk the rest of the day if
 
04:33:59.689 --> 04:33:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:05.349 --> 04:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:07.670 --> 04:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative testman do you going to
 
04:34:10.970 --> 04:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:16.551 --> 04:34:16.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:18.289 --> 04:34:18.299 align:start position:0%
yeah until noon time Nick come by
 
04:34:18.299 --> 04:34:19.070 align:start position:0%
yeah until noon time Nick come by
tomorrow

04:34:19.070 --> 04:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
04:34:23.631 --> 04:34:23.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:26.090 --> 04:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
you start before you begin you are now
 
04:34:28.250 --> 04:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
recognized for your point of order
 
04:34:30.590 --> 04:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
please State your point of order
 
04:34:32.990 --> 04:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
yes my point of order is I thought that
 
04:34:35.570 --> 04:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
I heard in a unanimous consent request
 
04:34:39.349 --> 04:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
for the consent calendar I maybe I may
 
04:34:41.330 --> 04:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
be incorrect I'm just curious your point
 
04:34:43.070 --> 04:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
of order is not a point of order uh
 
04:34:44.510 --> 04:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
therefore you are it's out of wood
 
04:34:46.010 --> 04:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
that's a parliament parliamentary
 
04:34:48.230 --> 04:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
inquiry and just remember a point of
 
04:34:50.689 --> 04:34:50.699 align:start position:0%
order is an objection that requires us
 
04:34:52.670 --> 04:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
to stop the entire hearing because you
 
04:34:54.170 --> 04:34:54.180 align:start position:0%
believe a rule is not being followed
 
04:34:56.269 --> 04:34:56.279 align:start position:0%
please you didn't State a point of order
 
04:34:57.789 --> 04:34:57.799 align:start position:0%
to just
 
04:35:02.029 --> 04:35:02.039 align:start position:0%
asking a question so at this point I've
 
04:35:03.529 --> 04:35:03.539 align:start position:0%
made my decision I've already ruled that
 
04:35:04.910 --> 04:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
your point of water wasn't a point of
 
04:35:07.429 --> 04:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
order and we're moving on
 
04:35:08.990 --> 04:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
at this time we are now going to close
 
04:35:11.029 --> 04:35:11.039 align:start position:0%
the executive session on House Bill
 
04:35:11.039 --> 04:35:17.689 align:start position:0%
the executive session on House Bill

House Bill 1539 today
 
04:36:12.109 --> 04:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
at the request of a constituent
 
04:36:14.330 --> 04:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to tell the story
 
04:36:18.709 --> 04:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
behind the reasoning for the legislation
 
04:36:20.810 --> 04:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
it's a young woman is a friend of our
 
04:36:23.869 --> 04:36:23.879 align:start position:0%
families and was involved in an incident
 
04:36:26.209 --> 04:36:26.219 align:start position:0%
approximately 18 months ago
 
04:36:28.310 --> 04:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
she attended a
 
04:36:30.349 --> 04:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
party a day-long party at her
 
04:36:31.609 --> 04:36:31.619 align:start position:0%
boyfriend's home
 
04:36:33.170 --> 04:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
and you know how those can go in the
 
04:36:34.849 --> 04:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
summer toward the end of the evening
 
04:36:37.670 --> 04:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
she was too intoxicated to drive
 
04:36:39.830 --> 04:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
but still wanted to drive
 
04:36:43.490 --> 04:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
her boyfriend thought better of that and
 
04:36:46.849 --> 04:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
hid her keys and it would not let her go
 
04:36:49.250 --> 04:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
she didn't like it and called the police
 
04:36:51.650 --> 04:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
this was not uh
 
04:36:53.390 --> 04:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
in the city of Manchester for the state
 
04:36:56.390 --> 04:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
police were called and dispatched to the
 
04:36:58.670 --> 04:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
situation the scene
 
04:36:58.680 --> 04:37:00.949 align:start position:0%
situation the scene
unfortunately

04:37:00.949 --> 04:37:00.959 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
when the police got there they did the
 
04:37:03.590 --> 04:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
best they could
 
04:37:04.789 --> 04:37:04.799 align:start position:0%
they were there for an hour and a half
 
04:37:07.250 --> 04:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what to do
 
04:37:09.051 --> 04:37:09.061 align:start position:0%
and I don't fault the state police at
 
04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
all they were doing their job
 
04:37:13.369 --> 04:37:13.379 align:start position:0%
and the only thing that they knew what
 
04:37:17.390 --> 04:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
to do was in the discussions uh
 
04:37:20.510 --> 04:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:23.209 --> 04:37:23.219 align:start position:0%
stated that she had knocked the glasses
 
04:37:25.551 --> 04:37:25.561 align:start position:0%
off her boyfriend's head trying to get
 
04:37:26.869 --> 04:37:26.879 align:start position:0%
away and they felt that was enough
 
04:37:29.029 --> 04:37:29.039 align:start position:0%
grounds and she was arrested for
 
04:37:32.209 --> 04:37:32.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:34.369 --> 04:37:34.379 align:start position:0%
about a few weeks later and she got an
 
04:37:36.230 --> 04:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
attorney and went and saw the prosecutor
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
and they determined that there was
 
04:37:41.990 --> 04:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
nothing to see here folks uh and dropped
 
04:37:43.849 --> 04:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
all the charges
 
04:37:48.051 --> 04:37:48.061 align:start position:0%
the um however the situation
 
04:37:50.269 --> 04:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
stays on the State Police blotter her
 
04:37:52.609 --> 04:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
name and her infraction
 
04:37:55.250 --> 04:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
so she would wanted to get that removed
 
04:37:57.769 --> 04:37:57.779 align:start position:0%
now that the charges were dropped
 
04:38:00.410 --> 04:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
she contacted the prosecutor she talked
 
04:38:02.590 --> 04:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
contacted the state police
 
04:38:05.449 --> 04:38:05.459 align:start position:0%
to which you know politely they said
 
04:38:06.830 --> 04:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
sorry there's nothing we can do about it
 
04:38:09.349 --> 04:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
talk to Google
 
04:38:09.359 --> 04:38:10.490 align:start position:0%
talk to Google
um

04:38:10.490 --> 04:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:12.170 --> 04:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
I brought a letter
 
04:38:13.670 --> 04:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
to the governor
 
04:38:15.470 --> 04:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
he thought something should be done he
 
04:38:16.670 --> 04:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
sent it to Attorney General's office
 
04:38:18.890 --> 04:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
they said it's not our jurisdiction
 
04:38:20.929 --> 04:38:20.939 align:start position:0%
so prosecutor couldn't do anything
 
04:38:23.510 --> 04:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
Governor couldn't do anything uh
 
04:38:24.650 --> 04:38:24.660 align:start position:0%
attorney general couldn't do anything
 
04:38:27.590 --> 04:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
and the state police said I'm sorry we
 
04:38:29.090 --> 04:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:38:31.310 --> 04:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
the public has the right to know
 
04:38:32.929 --> 04:38:32.939 align:start position:0%
so I'd like just to read a statement
 
04:38:39.529 --> 04:38:39.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:41.631 --> 04:38:41.641 align:start position:0%
I'm running to you this is the letter
 
04:38:44.090 --> 04:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
she wrote to the governor I'm writing to
 
04:38:46.490 --> 04:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
you for help with a personal issue
 
04:38:48.949 --> 04:38:48.959 align:start position:0%
I feel my future is compromised
 
04:38:51.470 --> 04:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
allow me to explain I was arrested for
 
04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor September of 2020 and the
 
04:38:56.750 --> 04:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
charges were eventually dropped
 
04:38:59.330 --> 04:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
I'm now facing judgment and backlash
 
04:39:01.250 --> 04:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
because my arrest is easily found in the
 
04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
state New Hampshire blotter while
 
04:39:04.730 --> 04:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
searching my name on the Internet
 
04:39:06.769 --> 04:39:06.779 align:start position:0%
this is affecting my future work success
 
04:39:09.470 --> 04:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
and livelihood my job search and my
 
04:39:14.029 --> 04:39:14.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:15.410 --> 04:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
it's also having an effect on my
 
04:39:17.750 --> 04:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
personal relationship as I am single and
 
04:39:19.789 --> 04:39:19.799 align:start position:0%
still dating all the above people are
 
04:39:22.189 --> 04:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
likely to to perform a Google search by
 
04:39:24.590 --> 04:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
name and it blotter is the first item
 
04:39:27.109 --> 04:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
that comes up I've spent over a thousand
 
04:39:29.689 --> 04:39:29.699 align:start position:0%
dollars trying to remove that to no
 
04:39:29.699 --> 04:39:30.769 align:start position:0%
dollars trying to remove that to no
avail

04:39:30.769 --> 04:39:30.779 align:start position:0%
avail
 
04:39:32.269 --> 04:39:32.279 align:start position:0%
this is a potential to ruin my
 
04:39:33.590 --> 04:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
reputation as a human resource
 
04:39:36.349 --> 04:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
professional a new business owner a
 
04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
daughter an aunt and neighbor
 
04:39:41.090 --> 04:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
I'm uh other than this case I've been an
 
04:39:42.590 --> 04:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
outstanding citizen I would like your
 
04:39:43.850 --> 04:39:43.860 align:start position:0%
help in getting this removed from the
 
04:39:43.860 --> 04:39:45.110 align:start position:0%
help in getting this removed from the
blotter

04:39:45.110 --> 04:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
blotter
 
04:39:47.410 --> 04:39:47.420 align:start position:0%
so the original Bill written by
 
04:39:50.810 --> 04:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
legislative Services put the onus on the
 
04:39:53.630 --> 04:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
state police to review all cases that be
 
04:39:55.670 --> 04:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh come dropped I didn't think that was
 
04:39:57.890 --> 04:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
appropriate didn't want to put the onus
 
04:39:59.030 --> 04:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
on them
 
04:40:00.530 --> 04:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
I'm going to put the owners on the
 
04:40:03.470 --> 04:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
individual who had been arrested to
 
04:40:06.530 --> 04:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
contact the State Police if they fell if
 
04:40:08.030 --> 04:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
their their charges were dropped if they
 
04:40:09.470 --> 04:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
felt that they wanted this removed from
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
the blotter
 
04:40:11.520 --> 04:40:12.288 align:start position:0%
the blotter
um

04:40:12.288 --> 04:40:12.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
again no malice toward the state police
 
04:40:16.130 --> 04:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
they did their job they did it right
 
04:40:18.890 --> 04:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
but there should be a mechanism in place
 
04:40:20.690 --> 04:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
where an individual can have things
 
04:40:22.670 --> 04:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
dropped now if representative Burt and I
 
04:40:23.750 --> 04:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
were in a bar
 
04:40:26.150 --> 04:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
and our we were defending our wives
 
04:40:28.670 --> 04:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
honors and uh
 
04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
some big thugs came after us and then an
 
04:40:33.948 --> 04:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
altercation happened and later on
 
04:40:35.570 --> 04:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
when it was all said and done and
 
04:40:37.130 --> 04:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
figured out and they saw that looked at
 
04:40:38.810 --> 04:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
the videotapes and saw that John and I
 
04:40:40.910 --> 04:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
were defending ourselves
 
04:40:44.170 --> 04:40:44.180 align:start position:0%
um I'd like that opportunity as I think
 
04:40:46.610 --> 04:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
representative Burke and maybe others
 
04:40:48.770 --> 04:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
here in this room would like
 
04:40:51.230 --> 04:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
the end of my testimony I'd be happy to
 
04:40:56.090 --> 04:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%

what that would mean to you as an
 
04:41:13.140 --> 04:41:14.390 align:start position:0%
what that would mean to you as an
individual

04:41:14.390 --> 04:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
individual
 
04:41:18.230 --> 04:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
should would you be open to an amendment
 
04:41:21.110 --> 04:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
because I'm sorry for clarification I
 
04:41:23.208 --> 04:41:23.218 align:start position:0%
don't know if that means a phone call in
 
04:41:25.730 --> 04:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
writing an email what kind of request
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%

thank you representative for the
 
04:41:34.190 --> 04:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
question very well Point well taken it
 
04:41:35.690 --> 04:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
should be something at least a written
 
04:41:41.030 --> 04:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative borne
 
04:41:46.490 --> 04:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank
 
04:41:48.890 --> 04:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
you so I I haven't heard testimony from
 
04:41:49.788 --> 04:41:49.798 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:41:52.910 --> 04:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:56.208 --> 04:41:56.218 align:start position:0%
uh and they he I think your testimony
 
04:41:58.670 --> 04:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
you indicated they
 
04:42:01.010 --> 04:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
couldn't remove it because Google
 
04:42:02.510 --> 04:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't let them
 
04:42:05.690 --> 04:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
is it possible that something that might
 
04:42:08.570 --> 04:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
be in a minimal would be to add a note
 
04:42:13.730 --> 04:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
to the blotter entry that indicated that
 
04:42:15.650 --> 04:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
drop the charges were dropped would that
 
04:42:21.230 --> 04:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:24.110 --> 04:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
well uh representative obviously getting
 
04:42:27.948 --> 04:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
something is better than nothing
 
04:42:29.930 --> 04:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
um however
 
04:42:29.940 --> 04:42:30.970 align:start position:0%
um however
um

04:42:30.970 --> 04:42:30.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:34.490 --> 04:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
based on the testimony of the the
 
04:42:36.230 --> 04:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
individual I read
 
04:42:38.330 --> 04:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
having something up there on a Google
 
04:42:41.628 --> 04:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
search as we all know many of us either
 
04:42:43.368 --> 04:42:43.378 align:start position:0%
like or dislike things that are said
 
04:42:46.788 --> 04:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
about us on social media and such
 
04:42:49.208 --> 04:42:49.218 align:start position:0%
um yeah I would rather it not be there
 
04:42:52.250 --> 04:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
if the all the charges are dropped but I
 
04:42:54.708 --> 04:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
would if the decision of this committee
 
04:42:55.850 --> 04:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:42:57.770 --> 04:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
that we're either going to kill the bill
 
04:42:59.750 --> 04:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
or go with that I would obviously take
 
04:43:02.570 --> 04:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
the ladder I do just want a question
 
04:43:02.580 --> 04:43:02.850 align:start position:0%
the ladder I do just want a question
um

04:43:02.850 --> 04:43:02.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:02.860 --> 04:43:05.150 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

04:43:05.150 --> 04:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:43:06.590 --> 04:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
correct something I think I just heard
 
04:43:09.708 --> 04:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
you say the individual it was a state
 
04:43:11.930 --> 04:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
police that said if you know we can't do
 
04:43:13.970 --> 04:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
it maybe you should ask Google if he can
 
04:43:15.650 --> 04:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
well they're not going to override the
 
04:43:19.070 --> 04:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
State Police blotter understandably
 
04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
04:43:22.610 --> 04:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to make sure that was
 
04:43:22.620 --> 04:43:23.570 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to make sure that was
clear

04:43:23.570 --> 04:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
clear
 
04:43:27.530 --> 04:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:29.868 --> 04:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
I think that is what I I try to
 
04:43:32.270 --> 04:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
reiterate and that's what I heard okay
 
04:43:34.670 --> 04:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:36.410 --> 04:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative Roy
 
04:43:37.910 --> 04:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:43:39.770 --> 04:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:43:42.670 --> 04:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
it's not the police blotter
 
04:43:48.230 --> 04:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:51.070 --> 04:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
without question it is and what was
 
04:43:53.948 --> 04:43:53.958 align:start position:0%
that's why I might just add to my answer
 
04:43:56.208 --> 04:43:56.218 align:start position:0%
and what was stated by the state police
 
04:43:57.890 --> 04:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
to the individual
 
04:44:01.310 --> 04:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
or was that you know the the
 
04:44:03.830 --> 04:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
citizens have the right to know and of
 
04:44:05.090 --> 04:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
what happened
 
04:44:07.850 --> 04:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
I I think my question comes down to the
 
04:44:10.490 --> 04:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
police had a very difficult decision to
 
04:44:10.500 --> 04:44:11.270 align:start position:0%
police had a very difficult decision to
make

04:44:11.270 --> 04:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:44:11.280 --> 04:44:12.890 align:start position:0%
make
okay

04:44:12.890 --> 04:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:44:17.090 --> 04:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
um and they did the best they could
 
04:44:19.010 --> 04:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
when it all said and done the prosecutor
 
04:44:20.868 --> 04:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
felt that there wasn't something that
 
04:44:24.110 --> 04:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
merited any charges
 
04:44:27.708 --> 04:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
so the way I look at it is that
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's by removing it it may be correcting
 
04:44:33.470 --> 04:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
the record by the record not being there
 
04:44:36.470 --> 04:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
I mean if I'm accused of a heinous crime
 
04:44:38.330 --> 04:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
by someone and I get arrested and comes
 
04:44:39.890 --> 04:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
and finds out that
 
04:44:43.010 --> 04:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
there's no merit to anything
 
04:44:44.690 --> 04:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
then I do believe
 
04:44:44.700 --> 04:44:45.650 align:start position:0%
then I do believe
um

04:44:45.650 --> 04:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:47.990 --> 04:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
there should be a way that that gets
 
04:44:50.628 --> 04:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
expunged from the record especially if
 
04:44:50.638 --> 04:44:52.850 align:start position:0%
expunged from the record especially if
it's

04:44:52.850 --> 04:44:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:57.410 --> 04:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:00.288 --> 04:45:00.298 align:start position:0%
opinion of the police officers was
 
04:45:02.570 --> 04:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
proven to be that it really
 
04:45:05.930 --> 04:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:09.110 --> 04:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:11.570 --> 04:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
representative Greene
 
04:45:17.750 --> 04:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:20.690 --> 04:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
I thought I had it on uh the boyfriend
 
04:45:22.670 --> 04:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
took her keys and he hit him
 
04:45:25.610 --> 04:45:25.620 align:start position:0%
he probably may have saved her life and
 
04:45:27.650 --> 04:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
maybe saved the fact that she may have
 
04:45:29.448 --> 04:45:29.458 align:start position:0%
had had a head-on collision with someone
 
04:45:32.090 --> 04:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
else and killed them
 
04:45:34.190 --> 04:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
Representative no doubt and I have no
 
04:45:36.470 --> 04:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
issue with what the the boyfriend did I
 
04:45:37.730 --> 04:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
don't think that's the part I'm trying
 
04:45:41.208 --> 04:45:41.218 align:start position:0%
to the point of of the legislation but
 
04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
you were recognized for your point of
 
04:45:42.718 --> 04:45:44.650 align:start position:0%
you were recognized for your point of
order

04:45:44.650 --> 04:45:44.660 align:start position:0%
order
 
04:45:48.410 --> 04:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman I I think um to put
 
04:45:51.830 --> 04:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh assumptions aspersions on a person's
 
04:45:53.330 --> 04:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
character without knowing the full story
 
04:45:56.330 --> 04:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
is inappropriate
 
04:45:58.190 --> 04:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
can you please reference a rule or
 
04:45:59.750 --> 04:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
anything in Mason specifically to your
 
04:46:01.190 --> 04:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
point of order
 
04:46:03.230 --> 04:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
or any house rule
 
04:46:03.240 --> 04:46:08.030 align:start position:0%
or any house rule
1352.

04:46:08.030 --> 04:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:14.390 --> 04:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:16.310 --> 04:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
your point of war is well taken I will
 
04:46:18.410 --> 04:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
say that the member that was not really
 
04:46:20.590 --> 04:46:20.600 align:start position:0%
a question was more of a comment
 
04:46:23.270 --> 04:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
so let's try to I'll remind everyone was
 
04:46:23.280 --> 04:46:24.650 align:start position:0%
so let's try to I'll remind everyone was
please

04:46:24.650 --> 04:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:46:27.770 --> 04:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
we asked what we phrase questions
 
04:46:29.690 --> 04:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
and that's how that's how we're supposed
 
04:46:30.770 --> 04:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
04:46:30.780 --> 04:46:31.788 align:start position:0%
to do it
okay

04:46:31.788 --> 04:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:46:33.350 --> 04:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
you may respond you're in the middle of
 
04:46:35.030 --> 04:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
a sense I'll allow you to continue thank
 
04:46:37.610 --> 04:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
you representative Mr chairman uh I'm
 
04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
not uh questioning what either was done
 
04:46:41.510 --> 04:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
this is unfortunate tonight we wish it
 
04:46:43.610 --> 04:46:43.620 align:start position:0%
all never happened uh and I don't
 
04:46:44.810 --> 04:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
disagree with you the right thing was
 
04:46:47.030 --> 04:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
done there it was as I said it was
 
04:46:48.890 --> 04:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
complicated incident it has to come down
 
04:46:51.830 --> 04:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
to the fact that once the charges were
 
04:46:51.840 --> 04:46:53.330 align:start position:0%
to the fact that once the charges were
dropped

04:46:53.330 --> 04:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
dropped
 
04:46:55.788 --> 04:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
I feel that an individual should have
 
04:46:58.010 --> 04:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
the ability to have that
 
04:46:59.868 --> 04:46:59.878 align:start position:0%
record on the police bought or bought or
 
04:47:02.030 --> 04:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
removed under that circumstances where
 
04:47:04.490 --> 04:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
the charges are dropped
 
04:47:07.128 --> 04:47:07.138 align:start position:0%
if they requested
 
04:47:14.570 --> 04:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:14.580 --> 04:47:16.730 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:47:16.730 --> 04:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:47:19.368 --> 04:47:19.378 align:start position:0%
if the state police showed up and she
 
04:47:20.990 --> 04:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
was still intoxicated would she have
 
04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
been arrested for DUI
 
04:47:26.510 --> 04:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
04:47:28.430 --> 04:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
you don't that's not question that not
 
04:47:30.350 --> 04:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the witness to address I
 
04:47:34.070 --> 04:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:39.110 --> 04:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:42.050 --> 04:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you uh
 
04:47:44.270 --> 04:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
representative infantine for taking my
 
04:47:44.280 --> 04:47:46.970 align:start position:0%
representative infantine for taking my
question

04:47:46.970 --> 04:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:51.170 --> 04:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
let us suppose that your bill passes it
 
04:47:54.110 --> 04:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
would still be on the Google
 
04:47:58.070 --> 04:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
website and yet it might have now a
 
04:48:01.190 --> 04:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up that it was expunged in the
 
04:48:03.110 --> 04:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
state police records would that be
 
04:48:03.120 --> 04:48:05.330 align:start position:0%
state police records would that be
correct

04:48:05.330 --> 04:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:48:08.470 --> 04:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
based on what representative bordenet
 
04:48:12.050 --> 04:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
had offered as a suggestion I think that
 
04:48:13.070 --> 04:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
would be the case you have to understand
 
04:48:15.410 --> 04:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
once things are on on the internet the
 
04:48:17.750 --> 04:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
way it works anytime anyone opens that
 
04:48:20.990 --> 04:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
back up it keeps coming back to the top
 
04:48:23.030 --> 04:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:48:24.650 --> 04:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
it's out there
 
04:48:26.090 --> 04:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
but it just wouldn't be on the police
 
04:48:27.708 --> 04:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
border which will allow this person at
 
04:48:29.628 --> 04:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
least to then have other accolades that
 
04:48:31.670 --> 04:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
she has received from being an HR
 
04:48:33.770 --> 04:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
professional that kind of brings it down
 
04:48:35.208 --> 04:48:35.218 align:start position:0%
a little bit so it's not the first thing
 
04:48:36.470 --> 04:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
that comes up when you see the young
 
04:48:39.590 --> 04:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:41.690 --> 04:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:48:43.730 --> 04:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
representative Bradley you recognize for
 
04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
a question thank you chairman and thank
 
04:48:47.750 --> 04:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
04:48:49.610 --> 04:48:49.620 align:start position:0%
um So currently are you saying that she
 
04:48:56.448 --> 04:48:56.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:58.250 --> 04:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
it would be hard for me to say no way
 
04:49:00.470 --> 04:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
but a thousand dollars worth of those
 
04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
companies it'll help you expunge those
 
04:49:04.368 --> 04:49:04.378 align:start position:0%
things hasn't worked it will go down
 
04:49:06.650 --> 04:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
three or four spaces it'll put up some
 
04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
accolades and other achievements that
 
04:49:11.270 --> 04:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
she's had in life and then as soon as
 
04:49:13.128 --> 04:49:13.138 align:start position:0%
the it seems like as soon as the blotter
 
04:49:15.050 --> 04:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
is opened by anyone at any time it comes
 
04:49:16.010 --> 04:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
back up
 
04:49:19.070 --> 04:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
so attempts have been made to no avail
 
04:49:20.810 --> 04:49:20.820 align:start position:0%
thank you that's exactly what I was
 
04:49:22.670 --> 04:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
getting at so
 
04:49:28.850 --> 04:49:28.860 align:start position:0%

11 and a line 23 the computer system for
 
04:50:07.430 --> 04:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
the police department if that that's not

accessible to the public right that's a
 
04:50:13.250 --> 04:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
back end private system for them

no when the when the police thank you
 
04:50:16.850 --> 04:50:16.860 align:start position:0%

04:50:18.530 --> 04:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
accurate this is not their their
 
04:50:21.708 --> 04:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
internal system this is their public
 
04:50:24.410 --> 04:50:24.420 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
04:50:59.270 --> 04:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
infantine for taking my question short
 
04:51:02.090 --> 04:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
of expunging the record entirely that is
 
04:51:04.368 --> 04:51:04.378 align:start position:0%
a historical record would it be possible
 
04:51:06.128 --> 04:51:06.138 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
04:51:06.138 --> 04:51:07.788 align:start position:0%
to uh
anonymize

04:51:07.788 --> 04:51:07.798 align:start position:0%
anonymize
 
04:51:10.250 --> 04:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
that the record stays there but the name
 
04:51:14.390 --> 04:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:17.770 --> 04:51:17.780 align:start position:0%
the record of an arrest did take place
 
04:51:22.190 --> 04:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh and uh it was and it it didn't get
 
04:51:24.230 --> 04:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
pursued so that the record is still
 
04:51:25.788 --> 04:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
there but the person's name is gone
 
04:51:25.798 --> 04:51:28.250 align:start position:0%
there but the person's name is gone
anonymized

04:51:28.250 --> 04:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
anonymized
 
04:51:29.690 --> 04:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
there could be a possibility
 
04:51:31.970 --> 04:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
representative I just don't know
 
04:51:31.980 --> 04:51:32.570 align:start position:0%
representative I just don't know
um

04:51:32.570 --> 04:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
how the the state police would do that
 
04:51:35.040 --> 04:51:36.830 align:start position:0%
how the the state police would do that
um

04:51:36.830 --> 04:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh the state that they went to so and so
 
04:51:42.170 --> 04:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
uh residents at a so and so time and
 
04:51:44.510 --> 04:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
arrested uh blank I don't know how that
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
would or arrested an individual but
 
04:51:51.170 --> 04:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
I don't know representative
 
04:51:54.350 --> 04:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
okay the chair May inquire with a
 
04:51:54.360 --> 04:51:56.868 align:start position:0%
okay the chair May inquire with a
question

04:51:56.868 --> 04:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:59.330 --> 04:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
so if this were to pass that the records
 
04:52:00.890 --> 04:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
may have come off the stapley's website
 
04:52:03.650 --> 04:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
but would that the arrest records still
 
04:52:05.270 --> 04:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
be public record
 
04:52:10.730 --> 04:52:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:16.490 --> 04:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:21.708 --> 04:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
Quest and line 23 and line 10. and that
 
04:52:26.150 --> 04:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
way it's stated signed and it's a
 
04:52:28.490 --> 04:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
if anybody checks into it they'll know
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
why it happened
 
04:52:35.510 --> 04:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:37.730 --> 04:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that's that was
 
04:52:48.310 --> 04:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:50.030 --> 04:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Klein Knight you're
 
04:52:58.670 --> 04:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:00.890 --> 04:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
thank you and we're confused with what
 
04:53:02.930 --> 04:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
has updated computer system really mean
 
04:53:06.350 --> 04:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
does the record still stay there and uh
 
04:53:09.170 --> 04:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
we if it it's right to know law so the
 
04:53:11.330 --> 04:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
record does need to stay there I think
 
04:53:14.810 --> 04:53:14.820 align:start position:0%
we have some amending to do with your
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
permission to Define some of these
 
04:53:21.590 --> 04:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
ambiguous terms so that we're
 
04:53:24.050 --> 04:53:24.060 align:start position:0%
specifically requesting that the
 
04:53:26.810 --> 04:53:26.820 align:start position:0%
information for our constituents is off
 
04:53:30.890 --> 04:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
social media but the record is remains
 
04:53:33.170 --> 04:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
with the police department and if
 
04:53:35.390 --> 04:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
anybody were to request it they could
 
04:53:37.368 --> 04:53:37.378 align:start position:0%
still have access to this information is
 
04:53:40.310 --> 04:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
that correct yes that is I will
 
04:53:41.930 --> 04:53:41.940 align:start position:0%

years as a legislator I've been down to
 
04:53:47.570 --> 04:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
this committee and I I find it similar
 
04:53:49.490 --> 04:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
issues we have in the labor committee
 
04:53:51.590 --> 04:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
where people come and they think they're
 
04:53:53.030 --> 04:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
doing something right but you get to see
 
04:53:55.550 --> 04:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
you folks see a lot more
 
04:53:57.650 --> 04:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
than I ever understand
 
04:53:59.868 --> 04:53:59.878 align:start position:0%
about the criminal justice system so my
 
04:53:59.878 --> 04:54:03.410 align:start position:0%

these questions I really do like this
 
04:54:10.010 --> 04:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
bill but I for clarity's sake I would
 
04:54:14.110 --> 04:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
just like to clear some uh concerns up
 
04:54:19.250 --> 04:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
was your constituents picture posted on
 
04:54:23.750 --> 04:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:26.690 --> 04:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
blotter it's blog that I have seen that
 
04:54:28.850 --> 04:54:28.860 align:start position:0%
does not have a picture it is just a
 
04:54:31.490 --> 04:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
written statement of the call the time
 
04:54:35.030 --> 04:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
the place and that someone was arrested
 
04:54:37.368 --> 04:54:37.378 align:start position:0%
for a a
 
04:54:39.250 --> 04:54:39.260 align:start position:0%
infraction of crime
 
04:54:42.590 --> 04:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
but there's no no picture
 
04:54:42.600 --> 04:54:45.890 align:start position:0%
but there's no no picture
follow-up

04:54:45.890 --> 04:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:50.510 --> 04:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't that in some way keep her uh
 
04:54:53.690 --> 04:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
privacy and we all share many names
 
04:54:57.110 --> 04:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
around the country with many individuals
 
04:55:00.050 --> 04:55:00.060 align:start position:0%
what would her picture not being up
 
04:55:03.650 --> 04:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
there protect her
 
04:55:07.490 --> 04:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh her her Point she has a um the way
 
04:55:10.010 --> 04:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
she spells her name is uh you is
 
04:55:11.930 --> 04:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
relatively unique and I think that's the
 
04:55:11.940 --> 04:55:13.010 align:start position:0%
relatively unique and I think that's the
situation

04:55:13.010 --> 04:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:55:15.708 --> 04:55:15.718 align:start position:0%
I pulled the name up in of all the names
 
04:55:17.510 --> 04:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
of the individual would have a similar
 
04:55:19.128 --> 04:55:19.138 align:start position:0%
name I was surprised that was the first
 
04:55:24.590 --> 04:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:29.448 --> 04:55:29.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:31.430 --> 04:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
I have a parliamentary inquiry and I
 
04:55:38.510 --> 04:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
please stay your parliamentary inquiry
 
04:55:43.430 --> 04:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
my parliamentary inquiry is that I've
 
04:55:46.310 --> 04:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
noticed that there's a typo in in one of
 
04:55:49.910 --> 04:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
the line sentences in here and my in my
 
04:55:52.128 --> 04:55:52.138 align:start position:0%
inquiry is is that handled
 
04:55:54.410 --> 04:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
administratively or would it be
 
04:55:57.288 --> 04:55:57.298 align:start position:0%
appropriate to point that out to the
 
04:55:59.448 --> 04:55:59.458 align:start position:0%
sponsor so that he can have that
 
04:55:59.458 --> 04:56:04.190 align:start position:0%
sponsor so that he can have that
corrected

04:56:04.190 --> 04:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:06.170 --> 04:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
any member of the committee is free to
 
04:56:08.990 --> 04:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
contact legis uh legislative services to
 
04:56:11.750 --> 04:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
actually get an amendment
 
04:56:15.110 --> 04:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
oh thank you just if there's a mistake
 
04:56:16.310 --> 04:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
in the bill anything you want to change
 
04:56:18.230 --> 04:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
at this point I assume every member of
 
04:56:19.970 --> 04:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
the committee knows how to get an
 
04:56:23.810 --> 04:56:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
follow-up I might recognize you for
 
04:56:33.590 --> 04:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:36.170 --> 04:56:36.180 align:start position:0%

04:56:46.010 --> 04:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:56:50.390 --> 04:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
we are way overthinking this so let me
 
04:56:54.470 --> 04:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
understand what your intentions are so I
 
04:56:56.690 --> 04:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
understand but
 
04:56:59.030 --> 04:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
I mean this state as it's not directed
 
04:57:01.070 --> 04:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
to represent from Goffstown we ask
 
04:57:01.080 --> 04:57:02.690 align:start position:0%
to represent from Goffstown we ask
questions

04:57:02.690 --> 04:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:57:05.628 --> 04:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
that's is ask State the question I'm
 
04:57:07.788 --> 04:57:07.798 align:start position:0%
asking a question it's not just you it's
 
04:57:09.350 --> 04:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
me going around since we all came back
 
04:57:11.868 --> 04:57:11.878 align:start position:0%
ask the question of the witness that's
 
04:57:13.730 --> 04:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
it if it's if the first sentence is not
 
04:57:15.650 --> 04:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
a question I'm going to deem the member
 
04:57:17.990 --> 04:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
out of order I'm going to move on next
 
04:57:19.850 --> 04:57:19.860 align:start position:0%
all right my question
 
04:57:19.860 --> 04:57:21.110 align:start position:0%
all right my question
is

04:57:21.110 --> 04:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:57:26.208 --> 04:57:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:29.448 --> 04:57:29.458 align:start position:0%
your intention is
 
04:57:31.788 --> 04:57:31.798 align:start position:0%
I was accused of something that I never
 
04:57:34.310 --> 04:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
did and I could prove I was over an ex
 
04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
place but my name is on the State
 
04:57:39.530 --> 04:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
website I want to get a job
 
04:57:43.250 --> 04:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
with my name on the State website please
 
04:57:45.410 --> 04:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
by removing that wouldn't that help me
 
04:57:47.390 --> 04:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
get that job
 
04:57:49.610 --> 04:57:49.620 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill is about
 
04:57:51.708 --> 04:57:51.718 align:start position:0%
is that true that is correct that is one
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
of the points I do not want to but I do
 
04:57:56.750 --> 04:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
not want to expunge the record the
 
04:57:58.670 --> 04:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
record is the record right this person
 
04:58:00.590 --> 04:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
will always have to deal with this if
 
04:58:02.570 --> 04:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
someone does a criminal background check
 
04:58:04.368 --> 04:58:04.378 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt about that not trying
 
04:58:06.350 --> 04:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
to do it it has to do with the the
 
04:58:08.570 --> 04:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
blotter itself it is up there for a lot
 
04:58:09.948 --> 04:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
of people to see and then when the
 
04:58:11.868 --> 04:58:11.878 align:start position:0%
charges were no longer or the charges
 
04:58:15.350 --> 04:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
were dropped that is because it does I
 
04:58:17.750 --> 04:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
don't know what the system the state
 
04:58:20.510 --> 04:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
police utilize but it gets picked up on
 
04:58:21.830 --> 04:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
the world wide web
 
04:58:24.350 --> 04:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
it is up here that is the only thing I'm
 
04:58:27.410 --> 04:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
looking to have expunged not the record
 
04:58:29.448 --> 04:58:29.458 align:start position:0%
not the charges not everything so you
 
04:58:31.550 --> 04:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
will have to deal with that the active
 
04:58:33.288 --> 04:58:33.298 align:start position:0%
or the consequences that you have
 
04:58:35.628 --> 04:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
because of what went on
 
04:58:39.708 --> 04:58:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:41.628 --> 04:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
04:58:41.638 --> 04:58:57.170 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
everyone

04:58:57.170 --> 04:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:06.948 --> 04:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:08.628 --> 04:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you members of
 
04:59:11.330 --> 04:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Victor muzzy I
 
04:59:12.530 --> 04:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
am a lieutenant with the New Hampshire
 
04:59:14.150 --> 04:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
State Police assigned to record
 
04:59:16.610 --> 04:59:16.620 align:start position:0%
Information Services
 
04:59:19.490 --> 04:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
um and I I can offer The Following on
 
04:59:21.230 --> 04:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
the language and the proposal and the
 
04:59:23.270 --> 04:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
proposed bill here I think there's been
 
04:59:25.090 --> 04:59:25.100 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion here this afternoon
 
04:59:27.770 --> 04:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
that were of some of concern to the
 
04:59:28.970 --> 04:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
state police
 
04:59:32.330 --> 04:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
and while I appreciate the intent I
 
04:59:34.490 --> 04:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
think the the language is a bit
 
04:59:37.550 --> 04:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
Broad in a sense that
 
04:59:40.368 --> 04:59:40.378 align:start position:0%
our position as the
 
04:59:42.230 --> 04:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
that the arrest did occur
 
04:59:46.250 --> 04:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
the extent by which uh what results from
 
04:59:48.708 --> 04:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
that arrest whether the charges remain
 
04:59:51.410 --> 04:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
or not that's obviously handled through
 
04:59:53.810 --> 04:59:53.820 align:start position:0%
a different process
 
04:59:56.750 --> 04:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
um I think our issue is the word State
 
04:59:56.760 --> 05:00:00.110 align:start position:0%
um I think our issue is the word State
Police

05:00:00.110 --> 05:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:03.470 --> 05:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
computer system implies that our
 
05:00:05.270 --> 05:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
internal records things like that would
 
05:00:07.788 --> 05:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
be affected by this request which in the
 
05:00:09.230 --> 05:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
interest of safety and transparency
 
05:00:11.090 --> 05:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
obviously we would not want to alter
 
05:00:13.070 --> 05:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
that because the arrest did occur in
 
05:00:16.730 --> 05:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
fact for a time and place however
 
05:00:18.830 --> 05:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
with respect to what the representative
 
05:00:21.230 --> 05:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
clearly articulated relative to the
 
05:00:24.770 --> 05:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:28.490 --> 05:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
far more easy for us to employ upon a
 
05:00:29.868 --> 05:00:29.878 align:start position:0%
written request from a defendant where
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
that's the case we can certainly do that
 
05:00:34.788 --> 05:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
I will only add my concern is
 
05:00:37.550 --> 05:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
and I think it's been stated here in
 
05:00:41.030 --> 05:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
some assemblies today that is that if
 
05:00:43.788 --> 05:00:43.798 align:start position:0%
another media Outlet Google whomever
 
05:00:46.368 --> 05:00:46.378 align:start position:0%
captures our blotter from our website
 
05:00:49.610 --> 05:00:49.620 align:start position:0%
via a screenshot via something else we
 
05:00:52.910 --> 05:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
immediately lose control of that and it
 
05:00:55.128 --> 05:00:55.138 align:start position:0%
may very well be that it still comes
 
05:00:56.930 --> 05:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
back on top of Google's search list or
 
05:00:59.390 --> 05:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
something like that so while I agree
 
05:01:01.430 --> 05:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
that certainly from our public-facing
 
05:01:04.190 --> 05:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
website removing that charge or removing
 
05:01:06.110 --> 05:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
that arrest at the request of the
 
05:01:09.590 --> 05:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
defendant is something we could do we
 
05:01:11.690 --> 05:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
can't prevent what might be that
 
05:01:14.030 --> 05:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
negative publicity for that person if
 
05:01:15.650 --> 05:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
that's captured by somebody else after
 
05:01:16.910 --> 05:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
we've put it out
 
05:01:18.890 --> 05:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
and what I can say relative to our
 
05:01:22.550 --> 05:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
weekly blotter is as it stands currently
 
05:01:25.368 --> 05:01:25.378 align:start position:0%
that blotter is a snapshot in time and
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
is sent out in a PDF format to our media
 
05:01:30.948 --> 05:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
Outlets we don't
 
05:01:33.530 --> 05:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge we may very well post it
 
05:01:35.868 --> 05:01:35.878 align:start position:0%
on our website we probably do but there
 
05:01:39.170 --> 05:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
again the format of that is a PDF it's
 
05:01:41.750 --> 05:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
not a living breathing roll call if you
 
05:01:44.510 --> 05:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
will of arrests that have been made and
 
05:01:47.030 --> 05:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
therefore we could remove the blotter as
 
05:01:49.430 --> 05:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
we've done in the past from our website
 
05:01:52.250 --> 05:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
I think our concern is how far and how
 
05:01:54.410 --> 05:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
deep has this spread beyond our control
 
05:01:56.270 --> 05:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
with the intent of the language in the
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
bill and what is Our obligation and
 
05:02:00.230 --> 05:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility to recall or withdraw
 
05:02:04.310 --> 05:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
that is is our biggest concern
 
05:02:05.990 --> 05:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my comments and
 
05:02:08.448 --> 05:02:08.458 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to take any questions
 
05:02:20.690 --> 05:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:24.288 --> 05:02:24.298 align:start position:0%
correct so if that's true why are you
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
opposing the bill
 
05:02:27.410 --> 05:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
I think because of the language in it
 
05:02:29.090 --> 05:02:29.100 align:start position:0%
where it talks about computer system I
 
05:02:30.170 --> 05:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know what the definition
 
05:02:33.288 --> 05:02:33.298 align:start position:0%
of definition of computer system is
 
05:02:35.570 --> 05:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
if that's really intended to be our
 
05:02:37.010 --> 05:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
website then I think the language should
 
05:02:39.770 --> 05:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
read public website versus
 
05:02:41.930 --> 05:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
computer system in addition because that
 
05:02:43.788 --> 05:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
insinuates in my
 
05:02:46.368 --> 05:02:46.378 align:start position:0%
interpretation that it's
 
05:02:48.470 --> 05:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
broader than just the website or some
 
05:02:51.170 --> 05:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
public facing advertisement that we've
 
05:02:51.180 --> 05:02:56.628 align:start position:0%
public facing advertisement that we've
made

05:02:56.628 --> 05:02:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:59.390 --> 05:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
it's clarifying if the chairman inquire
 
05:03:01.128 --> 05:03:01.138 align:start position:0%
with a question and thank you for taking
 
05:03:03.410 --> 05:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
my question is it the
 
05:03:06.230 --> 05:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
is it the concern that by having to
 
05:03:08.570 --> 05:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
remove the arrest records from the
 
05:03:09.770 --> 05:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
computer system that that would
 
05:03:11.270 --> 05:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
basically be scrubbing
 
05:03:13.788 --> 05:03:13.798 align:start position:0%
all the data that the Staples has of of
 
05:03:15.650 --> 05:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
a prior arrest
 
05:03:18.110 --> 05:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
from their system correct I think in the
 
05:03:20.030 --> 05:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
interest of transparency in an event
 
05:03:22.670 --> 05:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
having occurred if we're to alter our
 
05:03:24.410 --> 05:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
record system our records management
 
05:03:26.390 --> 05:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
system to reflect that this arrest never
 
05:03:28.128 --> 05:03:28.138 align:start position:0%
occurred because the charges were no
 
05:03:30.170 --> 05:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
profits or dismissed pursuant to the
 
05:03:31.788 --> 05:03:31.798 align:start position:0%
language and the written request or
 
05:03:34.310 --> 05:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
request was made by the defendant
 
05:03:36.050 --> 05:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
that somehow it's it's a double-edged
 
05:03:37.850 --> 05:03:37.860 align:start position:0%
sword because that did occur and we
 
05:03:39.170 --> 05:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
should have a record of that because it
 
05:03:40.730 --> 05:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
did occur but yet we now don't have a
 
05:03:44.448 --> 05:03:44.458 align:start position:0%
record of that I think is is the concern
 
05:03:46.970 --> 05:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
certainly the public facing portion of
 
05:03:49.788 --> 05:03:49.798 align:start position:0%
that I understand and have no no
 
05:03:52.310 --> 05:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
objection to that I think it's what is
 
05:03:54.350 --> 05:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill how deep does
 
05:03:57.170 --> 05:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
this removal or alteration of the record
 
05:03:59.090 --> 05:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
go and what does that really mean I
 
05:04:01.850 --> 05:04:01.860 align:start position:0%
think is our concern
 
05:04:05.690 --> 05:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:07.430 --> 05:04:07.440 align:start position:0%

05:04:16.850 --> 05:04:16.860 align:start position:0%
there is uh sent out as a PDF yes sir
 
05:04:22.430 --> 05:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
now is that uh PDF uh have
 
05:04:25.310 --> 05:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh historical data on it or is it
 
05:04:28.070 --> 05:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
updated ever so often or
 
05:04:31.550 --> 05:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
so that original record as it's still in
 
05:04:34.250 --> 05:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
the in the next PDF you send out
 
05:04:37.490 --> 05:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
good question sir the the arrest blotter
 
05:04:39.230 --> 05:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
is typically drafted for a week's time
 
05:04:42.170 --> 05:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
period and we post that on a weekly
 
05:04:44.030 --> 05:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
basis at the moment we're currently not
 
05:04:45.890 --> 05:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
doing that as we're working with our new
 
05:04:48.708 --> 05:04:48.718 align:start position:0%
vendor to build out that report that we
 
05:04:50.810 --> 05:04:50.820 align:start position:0%
have historically sent out
 
05:04:53.270 --> 05:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
so that's run on a weekly basis and post
 
05:04:56.090 --> 05:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
it on a weekly basis and what has
 
05:04:57.590 --> 05:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
happened with the data from the week
 
05:04:57.600 --> 05:04:58.670 align:start position:0%
happened with the data from the week
prior

05:04:58.670 --> 05:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
prior
 
05:05:01.250 --> 05:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
on our website I don't have the answer
 
05:05:02.750 --> 05:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
to that and obviously don't have any
 
05:05:04.910 --> 05:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
control over what happens to it beyond
 
05:05:07.070 --> 05:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
that but
 
05:05:09.230 --> 05:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
I guess what I was trying to articulate
 
05:05:11.090 --> 05:05:11.100 align:start position:0%
was that it's it's a snapshot in time
 
05:05:14.270 --> 05:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
and that it's sent out in a fairly
 
05:05:16.730 --> 05:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
finite format meaning it's it's a page
 
05:05:19.550 --> 05:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
of paper essentially in a PDF format and
 
05:05:22.010 --> 05:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
sent out on a weekly basis
 
05:05:22.020 --> 05:05:22.610 align:start position:0%
sent out on a weekly basis
um

05:05:22.610 --> 05:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:24.050 --> 05:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
I I didn't
 
05:05:26.628 --> 05:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
inquire of our own website how long we
 
05:05:29.090 --> 05:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
keep those if they're searchable by week
 
05:05:31.250 --> 05:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
time frame or if it's a running list if
 
05:05:32.110 --> 05:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
you will
 
05:05:34.490 --> 05:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
I think what we would have to do is if
 
05:05:36.410 --> 05:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
there was a request made to remove
 
05:05:38.390 --> 05:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
someone's information pursuant to the
 
05:05:40.730 --> 05:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
bill if it passes we would have to
 
05:05:42.890 --> 05:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
re-run that blotter for that given time
 
05:05:45.288 --> 05:05:45.298 align:start position:0%
frame and replace that on our website to
 
05:05:47.110 --> 05:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
be reflective of that change
 
05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
that makes any sense mechanically
 
05:05:53.090 --> 05:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
speaking would have to change that out
 
05:05:54.770 --> 05:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
I think I understand thank you very much
 
05:05:58.490 --> 05:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:00.110 --> 05:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you sir
 
05:06:01.368 --> 05:06:01.378 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
05:06:03.770 --> 05:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
as this document is shared with the
 
05:06:05.810 --> 05:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
media and with the public on a regular
 
05:06:05.820 --> 05:06:06.770 align:start position:0%
media and with the public on a regular
basis

05:06:06.770 --> 05:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
basis
 
05:06:09.230 --> 05:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
with any change to this document
 
05:06:12.410 --> 05:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
necessitate resending the document as a
 
05:06:13.910 --> 05:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
means of correcting quote unquote
 
05:06:16.250 --> 05:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
correcting the record I could with
 
05:06:18.770 --> 05:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
multiple different versions of a of a
 
05:06:20.690 --> 05:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
blotter existing it
 
05:06:22.610 --> 05:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
it's a scenario I don't think I've
 
05:06:24.530 --> 05:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
encountered before
 
05:06:26.570 --> 05:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
so if I understand you you're asking
 
05:06:28.430 --> 05:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
that if this if a request was made
 
05:06:29.990 --> 05:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this bill by an individual
 
05:06:32.570 --> 05:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
would we then resend that blotter for
 
05:06:34.550 --> 05:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
the period of time and question out to
 
05:06:36.050 --> 05:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
the media to say here's the corrected
 
05:06:37.190 --> 05:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
version of that
 
05:06:39.410 --> 05:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
that is the question and I should say as
 
05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
in a past life I was a news reporter and
 
05:06:44.990 --> 05:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
I would get these all the time and um
 
05:06:47.570 --> 05:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
these have uh
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
I'll stop it there but I guess would
 
05:06:51.890 --> 05:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
there be any correction of the record uh
 
05:06:53.990 --> 05:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
done by State Police other than
 
05:07:00.770 --> 05:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:00.780 --> 05:07:02.750 align:start position:0%
 
no

05:07:02.750 --> 05:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:07:04.850 --> 05:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
Unless somehow the bill changed it was
 
05:07:06.890 --> 05:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
reflective of that that required that we
 
05:07:08.390 --> 05:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
send it back out
 
05:07:10.788 --> 05:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
again I think immediately upon hitting
 
05:07:12.770 --> 05:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
send we have no control over it except
 
05:07:15.110 --> 05:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
for and on our website
 
05:07:16.788 --> 05:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
so if the union leader for example
 
05:07:18.830 --> 05:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
captured that somehow or another or some
 
05:07:20.570 --> 05:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
other news media Outlet captured that
 
05:07:23.150 --> 05:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
for that given point in time we could
 
05:07:25.430 --> 05:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
ask them to certainly repost the new
 
05:07:27.530 --> 05:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
information that we've put out
 
05:07:29.750 --> 05:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
but I we would have no control over it
 
05:07:32.270 --> 05:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
and to to the representatives point it
 
05:07:33.770 --> 05:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
would still be there on the on the world
 
05:07:37.010 --> 05:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
wide web I guess is our concern so
 
05:07:38.810 --> 05:07:38.820 align:start position:0%
I guess it goes into a broader question
 
05:07:40.610 --> 05:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
of where do we post and how do we post
 
05:07:42.470 --> 05:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
our arrests
 
05:07:44.390 --> 05:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
um and where is that information stored
 
05:07:46.070 --> 05:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
that that's probably a discussion for a
 
05:07:51.830 --> 05:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:53.990 --> 05:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative Klein Knight
 
05:07:55.430 --> 05:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
05:07:59.030 --> 05:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
um when media requests arrest record
 
05:08:01.690 --> 05:08:01.700 align:start position:0%
how frequently do they do that for for
 
05:08:05.208 --> 05:08:05.218 align:start position:0%
their own websites
 
05:08:07.490 --> 05:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
don't have a direct answer to that I
 
05:08:09.110 --> 05:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
know that as a matter of regular
 
05:08:10.970 --> 05:08:10.980 align:start position:0%
practice we send it out on a weekly
 
05:08:10.980 --> 05:08:12.170 align:start position:0%
practice we send it out on a weekly
basis

05:08:12.170 --> 05:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
basis
 
05:08:15.350 --> 05:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:18.170 --> 05:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a follow-up so you
 
05:08:20.990 --> 05:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
send it out on a weekly basis would it
 
05:08:24.708 --> 05:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
not be a crazy idea to also send out
 
05:08:28.850 --> 05:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
with that a list of those removed to the
 
05:08:34.070 --> 05:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:36.050 --> 05:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
the way the system would capture that is
 
05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
we we run on a rush report for events
 
05:08:40.250 --> 05:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
that occurred between
 
05:08:42.590 --> 05:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
date a and date B
 
05:08:44.510 --> 05:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
and that happens on a weekly basis and
 
05:08:46.788 --> 05:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
it's typically Friday to Thursday which
 
05:08:48.590 --> 05:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
is which is our weekly time frame so
 
05:08:50.628 --> 05:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
what happened last week doesn't get
 
05:08:53.270 --> 05:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
reposted again currently this week for
 
05:08:53.280 --> 05:08:54.310 align:start position:0%
reposted again currently this week for
example

05:08:54.310 --> 05:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:09:00.410 --> 05:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:02.150 --> 05:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
you may ask a follow-up question thank
 
05:09:06.110 --> 05:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:08.270 --> 05:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:09:08.280 --> 05:09:09.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:09:09.470 --> 05:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:10.788 --> 05:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna
 
05:09:13.970 --> 05:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
try and clarify
 
05:09:17.868 --> 05:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
not what they post on a week to week
 
05:09:20.150 --> 05:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
basis what you give them on a
 
05:09:21.948 --> 05:09:21.958 align:start position:0%
week-to-week basis could you also
 
05:09:25.250 --> 05:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
include in that week if you had any
 
05:09:28.610 --> 05:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
requests from a citizen to remove their
 
05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
record could you also include that when
 
05:09:33.590 --> 05:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
you give them the weekly report this is
 
05:09:35.448 --> 05:09:35.458 align:start position:0%
what we receive these people have been
 
05:09:35.458 --> 05:09:41.750 align:start position:0%
what we receive these people have been
expunged

05:09:41.750 --> 05:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:46.430 --> 05:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:50.628 --> 05:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
as my assistant is the member asking uh
 
05:09:52.850 --> 05:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
is this could the state police include
 
05:09:55.070 --> 05:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
that the member of the public requested
 
05:09:56.270 --> 05:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
that they be removed from the website
 
05:09:58.070 --> 05:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
when they put their information out
 
05:09:59.570 --> 05:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
there to the media sites is that what
 
05:10:02.930 --> 05:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:04.430 --> 05:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the answer to that at the
 
05:10:04.440 --> 05:10:05.930 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the answer to that at the
moment

05:10:05.930 --> 05:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
moment
 
05:10:08.448 --> 05:10:08.458 align:start position:0%
sounds reasonable I don't know how to
 
05:10:10.430 --> 05:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
execute that
 
05:10:13.310 --> 05:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:15.170 --> 05:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
representative true you recognize for a
 
05:10:15.180 --> 05:10:16.010 align:start position:0%
representative true you recognize for a
question

05:10:16.010 --> 05:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:10:18.110 --> 05:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you lieutenant
 
05:10:19.970 --> 05:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:10:21.170 --> 05:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
could you please tell me if I'm
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
correctly stating restating your opinion
 
05:10:29.030 --> 05:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
that you can the state police can remove
 
05:10:31.310 --> 05:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
from the public internet website this
 
05:10:31.320 --> 05:10:33.288 align:start position:0%
from the public internet website this
information

05:10:33.288 --> 05:10:33.298 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:10:35.570 --> 05:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
but there is a legal difficulty in
 
05:10:37.810 --> 05:10:37.820 align:start position:0%
removing it from a computer system
 
05:10:41.750 --> 05:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
because you can't arbitrarily expunge
 
05:10:44.570 --> 05:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
historical data
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
05:10:51.770 --> 05:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:53.690 --> 05:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
05:10:55.330 --> 05:10:55.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:10:59.330 --> 05:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:04.250 --> 05:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:05.930 --> 05:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
if I could just inquire that I see the
 
05:11:07.788 --> 05:11:07.798 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor still here if I can just
 
05:11:09.410 --> 05:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
ask one question
 
05:11:09.420 --> 05:11:10.850 align:start position:0%
ask one question
uh

05:11:10.850 --> 05:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:11:12.850 --> 05:11:12.860 align:start position:0%
would there be it would you have any
 
05:11:14.930 --> 05:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
concern with
 
05:11:16.910 --> 05:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
if we just struck the term computer
 
05:11:18.530 --> 05:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
system and
 
05:11:21.830 --> 05:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
from both lines 11 and 23 of this this
 
05:11:24.410 --> 05:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
bill in an amendment I would not it was
 
05:11:27.350 --> 05:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
never my intent to expunge the record uh
 
05:11:29.868 --> 05:11:29.878 align:start position:0%
the difference differential by naivete
 
05:11:31.090 --> 05:11:31.100 align:start position:0%
for not knowing the difference between
 
05:11:34.310 --> 05:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
LL how a legislative Services wrote the
 
05:11:37.610 --> 05:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
computer system versus uh web web page
 
05:11:39.410 --> 05:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
so no I would not have any problem I
 
05:11:41.628 --> 05:11:41.638 align:start position:0%
would appreciate that Mr chairman
 
05:11:47.150 --> 05:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:49.010 --> 05:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
at this time we can now close the
 
05:11:49.020 --> 05:11:50.030 align:start position:0%
at this time we can now close the
executives

05:11:50.030 --> 05:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
executives
 
05:11:52.010 --> 05:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
excuse me the public hearing on House
 
05:12:06.470 --> 05:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:08.150 --> 05:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
at this time we are now opening the
 
05:12:18.948 --> 05:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:21.948 --> 05:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
someone to introduce the bill
 
05:12:24.110 --> 05:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
is your member
 
05:12:37.368 --> 05:12:37.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:44.390 --> 05:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:47.510 --> 05:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
let's see where are we now did we just
 
05:13:29.150 --> 05:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:29.160 --> 05:13:29.890 align:start position:0%
 
before

05:13:29.890 --> 05:13:29.900 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:13:35.750 --> 05:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:37.970 --> 05:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
the record I'm representative Welch to
 
05:13:41.270 --> 05:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
represent Rockingham District 13. I was
 
05:13:43.788 --> 05:13:43.798 align:start position:0%
asked to put this bill in
 
05:13:47.330 --> 05:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
and again I'm not going to board the
 
05:13:49.550 --> 05:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
committee with my opinions
 
05:13:52.310 --> 05:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
there are experts who suggested that
 
05:13:53.390 --> 05:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:13:55.250 --> 05:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
you put in and they will answer the
 
05:13:55.260 --> 05:14:02.930 align:start position:0%
you put in and they will answer the
questions

05:14:02.930 --> 05:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:21.708 --> 05:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:24.410 --> 05:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognizes
 
05:14:26.150 --> 05:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
by sheer
 
05:14:30.170 --> 05:14:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:30.180 --> 05:14:34.070 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:14:34.070 --> 05:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:34.080 --> 05:14:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
it's

05:14:36.470 --> 05:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:14:37.850 --> 05:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
it's my it's my understanding you
 
05:14:39.288 --> 05:14:39.298 align:start position:0%
weren't ready to testify the clerk has
 
05:14:41.030 --> 05:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
informed me that you wish to be called
 
05:14:43.970 --> 05:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:43.980 --> 05:14:52.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:14:52.250 --> 05:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:54.230 --> 05:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
you made me excuse I will recall you as
 
05:15:00.050 --> 05:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:02.090 --> 05:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
this time the chair recognizes Lori
 
05:15:02.100 --> 05:15:15.410 align:start position:0%
this time the chair recognizes Lori
Roberts

05:15:15.410 --> 05:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:17.510 --> 05:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
there you go there we go
 
05:15:19.490 --> 05:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
05:15:22.070 --> 05:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Lori
 
05:15:24.830 --> 05:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
Roberts I am a state policy Advocate at
 
05:15:26.570 --> 05:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
the national Innocence Project
 
05:15:28.490 --> 05:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh we're an organization that works to
 
05:15:30.770 --> 05:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
exonerate the wrongfully convicted and
 
05:15:32.270 --> 05:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
we also work with our local Partners
 
05:15:33.590 --> 05:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
including the New England Innocence
 
05:15:36.050 --> 05:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
Project on policy reforms that prevent
 
05:15:37.730 --> 05:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
wrongful convictions
 
05:15:42.288 --> 05:15:42.298 align:start position:0%
we strongly support HB 1540 and we thank
 
05:15:44.208 --> 05:15:44.218 align:start position:0%
representative Welch for his work on it
 
05:15:46.190 --> 05:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
as well as representative Bert and wall
 
05:15:47.690 --> 05:15:47.700 align:start position:0%
for their support
 
05:15:50.110 --> 05:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation would require
 
05:15:52.190 --> 05:15:52.200 align:start position:0%
electronic recording of custodial
 
05:15:55.010 --> 05:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
interrogations in their entirety from
 
05:15:57.530 --> 05:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
the reading of Miranda rights to the end
 
05:15:59.868 --> 05:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
of the questioning this creates an
 
05:16:02.090 --> 05:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
irrefutable account of what occurred
 
05:16:04.310 --> 05:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
during the interrogation which benefits
 
05:16:07.190 --> 05:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
the innocent law enforcement and
 
05:16:09.948 --> 05:16:09.958 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that is why legal and law
 
05:16:12.230 --> 05:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement organizations have endorsed
 
05:16:14.750 --> 05:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
electronic recording as a safeguard
 
05:16:16.910 --> 05:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
against false confessions including the
 
05:16:19.250 --> 05:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
national uniform law commission the
 
05:16:20.930 --> 05:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
International Association of chiefs of
 
05:16:24.590 --> 05:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
police the American Bar Association the
 
05:16:26.330 --> 05:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
American legislative exchange Council
 
05:16:28.368 --> 05:16:28.378 align:start position:0%
and many others
 
05:16:28.378 --> 05:16:29.150 align:start position:0%
and many others
um

05:16:29.150 --> 05:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:31.910 --> 05:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
also 30 States already require this
 
05:16:33.650 --> 05:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
practice for at least the most severe
 
05:16:36.050 --> 05:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
crimes including neighboring Maine
 
05:16:38.590 --> 05:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
Vermont Massachusetts and Connecticut
 
05:16:41.030 --> 05:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
and the federal federal law enforcement
 
05:16:43.550 --> 05:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
agencies including the FBI and DEA
 
05:16:46.550 --> 05:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
record interrogations for all crimes
 
05:16:48.288 --> 05:16:48.298 align:start position:0%
it can be hard for people to believe
 
05:16:49.970 --> 05:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
that someone would admit to a crime they
 
05:16:52.610 --> 05:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
didn't commit but nationally false
 
05:16:54.650 --> 05:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
confessions have played a role in nearly
 
05:16:56.930 --> 05:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
a third of wrongful convictions later
 
05:16:59.750 --> 05:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
overturned by DNA evidence and of those
 
05:17:02.628 --> 05:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
cases the real perpetrator went on to
 
05:17:05.390 --> 05:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
commit and be convicted of 48 additional
 
05:17:08.930 --> 05:17:08.940 align:start position:0%
violent crimes including 14 rapes and 25
 
05:17:08.940 --> 05:17:10.128 align:start position:0%
violent crimes including 14 rapes and 25
murders

05:17:10.128 --> 05:17:10.138 align:start position:0%
murders
 
05:17:12.410 --> 05:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
so there is a very real Public Safety
 
05:17:15.350 --> 05:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
implication to false confessions and to
 
05:17:16.730 --> 05:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
wrongful convictions
 
05:17:18.708 --> 05:17:18.718 align:start position:0%
as we advocate for these laws around the
 
05:17:20.030 --> 05:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
country we typically hear three
 
05:17:22.970 --> 05:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
questions what are the costs how can
 
05:17:25.150 --> 05:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
small agencies implement this practice
 
05:17:28.490 --> 05:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
and why should this be required
 
05:17:30.288 --> 05:17:30.298 align:start position:0%
and in the interest of time I'll be
 
05:17:31.730 --> 05:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
brief but I'm happy to go into any more
 
05:17:33.708 --> 05:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
detail on any of those questions for the
 
05:17:33.718 --> 05:17:34.850 align:start position:0%
detail on any of those questions for the
committee

05:17:34.850 --> 05:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:17:34.860 --> 05:17:35.868 align:start position:0%
committee
um

05:17:35.868 --> 05:17:35.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:38.390 --> 05:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
to better understand costs the Innocence
 
05:17:39.830 --> 05:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
Project surveyed law enforcement
 
05:17:42.050 --> 05:17:42.060 align:start position:0%
agencies in Wisconsin and Massachusetts
 
05:17:44.270 --> 05:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
which have required the practice for
 
05:17:45.650 --> 05:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
over a decade
 
05:17:47.570 --> 05:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
we received responses from over 100
 
05:17:51.590 --> 05:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
agencies 111 to be exact both large and
 
05:17:54.948 --> 05:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
small and none reported any problems
 
05:17:56.510 --> 05:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
with implementation
 
05:17:58.150 --> 05:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
smaller agencies
 
05:18:00.770 --> 05:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
reported using handheld digital video
 
05:18:04.610 --> 05:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
cameras that retail for fifty to 100 and
 
05:18:06.350 --> 05:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
several agencies also reported using
 
05:18:08.990 --> 05:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
body cameras to record interrogations
 
05:18:11.810 --> 05:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
most reported storing recordings on
 
05:18:13.670 --> 05:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
existing computer servers or burning
 
05:18:15.530 --> 05:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
them onto DVDs meaning that they didn't
 
05:18:17.510 --> 05:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
have to buy additional storage
 
05:18:19.670 --> 05:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
and in general what we found was that
 
05:18:21.530 --> 05:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
recording interrogations actually saves
 
05:18:23.930 --> 05:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
money by reducing lawsuits stemming from
 
05:18:25.610 --> 05:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
frivolous allegations of misconduct
 
05:18:28.310 --> 05:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
against police officers improving Court
 
05:18:30.050 --> 05:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
efficiency by reducing motions to
 
05:18:32.750 --> 05:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
suppress and increasing plea deals and
 
05:18:34.730 --> 05:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
protecting taxpayers from multi-million
 
05:18:36.708 --> 05:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
dollar civil payouts associated with
 
05:18:38.390 --> 05:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
wrongful convictions
 
05:18:41.090 --> 05:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
next how can small agencies with limited
 
05:18:43.730 --> 05:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
resources Implement a recording of
 
05:18:45.948 --> 05:18:45.958 align:start position:0%
interrogation's policy what we found in
 
05:18:48.530 --> 05:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
our survey was that about 13 of agencies
 
05:18:52.128 --> 05:18:52.138 align:start position:0%
that responded had 10 or fewer officers
 
05:18:54.470 --> 05:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
and most of those agencies reported that
 
05:18:56.750 --> 05:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
they used handheld digital recorders for
 
05:18:56.760 --> 05:18:58.010 align:start position:0%
they used handheld digital recorders for
interrogations

05:18:58.010 --> 05:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
interrogations
 
05:19:00.170 --> 05:19:00.180 align:start position:0%
small agencies that want to use more
 
05:19:02.030 --> 05:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
high-tech recording systems can consider
 
05:19:04.010 --> 05:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
equipment sharing agreements with larger
 
05:19:06.470 --> 05:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
agencies 22 percent of our survey
 
05:19:07.670 --> 05:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
respondents said they had equipment
 
05:19:09.350 --> 05:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
sharing agreements with local state or
 
05:19:11.030 --> 05:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
federal agencies
 
05:19:12.948 --> 05:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
and then finally why should this be
 
05:19:14.690 --> 05:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
required well
 
05:19:16.670 --> 05:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
a number of agencies in New Hampshire
 
05:19:18.730 --> 05:19:18.740 align:start position:0%
have already implemented this practice
 
05:19:21.230 --> 05:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
based on Outreach conducted by former
 
05:19:23.090 --> 05:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
U.S attorney Thomas Sullivan and the
 
05:19:25.250 --> 05:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
Innocence Project these agencies include
 
05:19:29.030 --> 05:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
Carol Concord Conway Enfield Keen
 
05:19:32.208 --> 05:19:32.218 align:start position:0%
Laconia Lebanon Nashua Plymouth
 
05:19:35.690 --> 05:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Swansea and the state police
 
05:19:37.910 --> 05:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
which is a great start but there needs
 
05:19:40.490 --> 05:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
to be a uniform Statewide practice to
 
05:19:42.288 --> 05:19:42.298 align:start position:0%
ensure the fair administration of
 
05:19:43.750 --> 05:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
justice throughout New Hampshire
 
05:19:46.250 --> 05:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
otherwise agencies could simply choose
 
05:19:48.948 --> 05:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
not to record choose to record only in
 
05:19:51.230 --> 05:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
certain cases or choose to start and
 
05:19:53.270 --> 05:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
stop the tape when they want
 
05:19:55.610 --> 05:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
a requirement would ensure a uniform
 
05:19:57.350 --> 05:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
Statewide practice of recording
 
05:19:59.750 --> 05:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
interrogations otherwise someone in
 
05:20:01.788 --> 05:20:01.798 align:start position:0%
Derry may not have the same protections
 
05:20:04.128 --> 05:20:04.138 align:start position:0%
as someone in Hanover and are on the
 
05:20:06.230 --> 05:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
same side of the coin an officer falsely
 
05:20:08.510 --> 05:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
accused of misconduct in Dairy would not
 
05:20:09.948 --> 05:20:09.958 align:start position:0%
have the same protections as an officer
 
05:20:11.330 --> 05:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
in Hanover
 
05:20:13.730 --> 05:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
uh there also needs to be a remedy for
 
05:20:17.090 --> 05:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
failure to comply HP 1540 follows the
 
05:20:20.750 --> 05:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
model of States like Texas Utah Alaska
 
05:20:22.430 --> 05:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
and Connecticut
 
05:20:24.350 --> 05:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
by suppressing an unrecorded statement
 
05:20:26.570 --> 05:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
but still allowing the state to overcome
 
05:20:28.490 --> 05:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
this presumption if they show that the
 
05:20:30.890 --> 05:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
statement was voluntary and reliable and
 
05:20:32.448 --> 05:20:32.458 align:start position:0%
there was a reasonable justification for
 
05:20:34.550 --> 05:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
why the statement was not recorded
 
05:20:36.590 --> 05:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
so finally to help agencies with
 
05:20:38.270 --> 05:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
implementation the Innocence Project has
 
05:20:40.730 --> 05:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
created a law enforcement primer based
 
05:20:42.770 --> 05:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
on our survey and other research and we
 
05:20:44.030 --> 05:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
have model policies from the
 
05:20:45.590 --> 05:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
International Association of chiefs of
 
05:20:47.510 --> 05:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
police that would be we would be happy
 
05:20:49.550 --> 05:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
to make available to every agency in the
 
05:20:49.560 --> 05:20:50.330 align:start position:0%
to make available to every agency in the
state

05:20:50.330 --> 05:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:20:52.850 --> 05:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
electronic recording not only improves
 
05:20:55.368 --> 05:20:55.378 align:start position:0%
justice but it improves efficiency and
 
05:20:57.288 --> 05:20:57.298 align:start position:0%
Savings in the criminal justice system
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
and we would welcome the opportunity to
 
05:21:00.650 --> 05:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
work with law enforcement to make
 
05:21:03.170 --> 05:21:03.180 align:start position:0%
implementation as easy as possible
 
05:21:05.090 --> 05:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
we really appreciate the committee
 
05:21:07.368 --> 05:21:07.378 align:start position:0%
considering this bill and we strongly
 
05:21:08.868 --> 05:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
hope you will vote in favor thank you
 
05:21:11.990 --> 05:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:14.930 --> 05:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:17.150 --> 05:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:21:19.430 --> 05:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
um looking at the definitions in the
 
05:21:23.150 --> 05:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
bill under custodial interrogation is
 
05:21:26.510 --> 05:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
have you is this definition matched by
 
05:21:28.310 --> 05:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court definition of
 
05:21:30.128 --> 05:21:30.138 align:start position:0%
consortial interrogation
 
05:21:33.590 --> 05:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
of the uh Miranda as you know that's
 
05:21:35.330 --> 05:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
what triggers Miranda is custodial
 
05:21:38.390 --> 05:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
interrogation so does this match that
 
05:21:41.628 --> 05:21:41.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:43.490 --> 05:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
on that but in the bill the the
 
05:21:45.470 --> 05:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
definition is that it's a reasonable
 
05:21:47.990 --> 05:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
person would uh consider themselves to
 
05:21:50.990 --> 05:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
be under uh interrogation
 
05:21:53.570 --> 05:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to get a positive answer
 
05:21:55.070 --> 05:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
on that for you
 
05:21:57.890 --> 05:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
thank you I I asked because it would if
 
05:21:59.750 --> 05:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
the two conflict wouldn't you agree that
 
05:22:01.610 --> 05:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
that would be a problem absolutely thank
 
05:22:01.620 --> 05:22:08.030 align:start position:0%
that would be a problem absolutely thank
you

05:22:08.030 --> 05:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:21.110 --> 05:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:22.670 --> 05:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
thank you in respect of the prior
 
05:22:25.070 --> 05:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
witness uh witness is there any did you
 
05:22:29.470 --> 05:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:32.330 --> 05:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to maybe bring a copy up
 
05:22:41.410 --> 05:22:41.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:44.030 --> 05:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognizes Lynn

05:23:36.350 --> 05:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Michigan Mr chair members
 
05:23:38.690 --> 05:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Lynn Marie
 
05:23:41.090 --> 05:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
kuzak and I am a
 
05:23:42.890 --> 05:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
attorney for the New Hampshire
 
05:23:44.990 --> 05:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections as well as the
 
05:23:47.090 --> 05:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
Director of Professional Standards at
 
05:23:49.430 --> 05:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
the department the department is neutral
 
05:23:51.708 --> 05:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
on this bill although we do have a few
 
05:23:51.718 --> 05:23:53.330 align:start position:0%
on this bill although we do have a few
concerns

05:23:53.330 --> 05:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
05:23:57.170 --> 05:23:57.180 align:start position:0%
um and as honorable member already asked
 
05:23:59.208 --> 05:23:59.218 align:start position:0%
the question about what it means to be a
 
05:24:01.910 --> 05:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
con a custodial inner
 
05:24:04.448 --> 05:24:04.458 align:start position:0%
custodial interrogation
 
05:24:07.628 --> 05:24:07.638 align:start position:0%
the term custodial energy
 
05:24:11.208 --> 05:24:11.218 align:start position:0%
interrogation is one that is really not
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
defined well in this bill
 
05:24:16.910 --> 05:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
and I say that because it's unclear from
 
05:24:18.470 --> 05:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections standpoint
 
05:24:20.930 --> 05:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
what that really means an individual
 
05:24:22.250 --> 05:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
that's already arrested already
 
05:24:25.730 --> 05:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
sentenced and already in custody could
 
05:24:29.030 --> 05:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
have an argument that any time they are
 
05:24:32.448 --> 05:24:32.458 align:start position:0%
questioned by an officer one of my
 
05:24:34.730 --> 05:24:34.740 align:start position:0%
investigators a corrections officer a
 
05:24:37.368 --> 05:24:37.378 align:start position:0%
parole and probation officer that they
 
05:24:40.128 --> 05:24:40.138 align:start position:0%
are subject to a custodial interrogation
 
05:24:42.590 --> 05:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
that's not what I think the intent of
 
05:24:45.288 --> 05:24:45.298 align:start position:0%
this bill is the intent of the bill I
 
05:24:49.670 --> 05:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
believe is to make a recording of any
 
05:24:53.330 --> 05:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
custodial arrest that occurs and if we
 
05:24:56.390 --> 05:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
look at the definition of RSA 594 colon
 
05:24:58.610 --> 05:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
1 that defines an arrest as The Taking
 
05:25:01.070 --> 05:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
of a person into custody in order that
 
05:25:03.050 --> 05:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
he may be forthcoming to answer for the
 
05:25:04.550 --> 05:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
commission of a crime
 
05:25:07.430 --> 05:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
again from our perspective at the
 
05:25:09.830 --> 05:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections
 
05:25:12.470 --> 05:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
there if a new crime is committed we're
 
05:25:14.390 --> 05:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
certainly going to
 
05:25:16.490 --> 05:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
record that
 
05:25:18.530 --> 05:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
any session that is
 
05:25:18.540 --> 05:25:20.030 align:start position:0%
any session that is
um

05:25:20.030 --> 05:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:22.550 --> 05:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
that takes place when that individual is
 
05:25:25.010 --> 05:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
questioned but when it comes to a
 
05:25:28.190 --> 05:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearing when an individual
 
05:25:31.250 --> 05:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
creates or has an infraction violates
 
05:25:35.570 --> 05:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
one of our disciplinary rules then they
 
05:25:37.970 --> 05:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
are potentially going to incriminate
 
05:25:39.470 --> 05:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
themselves when they're asked a question
 
05:25:42.350 --> 05:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
about that that's not I believe what the
 
05:25:44.150 --> 05:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is and that's where
 
05:25:46.490 --> 05:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
our concern comes into play because it
 
05:25:48.590 --> 05:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
does talk about in one of the sections
 
05:25:51.948 --> 05:25:51.958 align:start position:0%
where these interrogations take place a
 
05:25:53.390 --> 05:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
Corrections Facility
 
05:25:55.490 --> 05:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Corrections
 
05:25:58.128 --> 05:25:58.138 align:start position:0%
has three prisons has three halfway
 
05:26:00.770 --> 05:26:00.780 align:start position:0%
houses and a transitional work center so
 
05:26:02.570 --> 05:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
anytime an individual is questioned in
 
05:26:05.690 --> 05:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
one of those locations we could expect
 
05:26:08.510 --> 05:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
them to say we're now being interrogated
 
05:26:11.330 --> 05:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
in a custodial setting
 
05:26:13.730 --> 05:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we want to point
 
05:26:17.650 --> 05:26:17.660 align:start position:0%
out is because it does talk about a
 
05:26:20.810 --> 05:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
Corrections Facility as a place where a
 
05:26:24.770 --> 05:26:24.780 align:start position:0%
custodial interrogation could occur
 
05:26:27.890 --> 05:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't include right now
 
05:26:29.810 --> 05:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
05:26:32.030 --> 05:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
which would be paroled probation
 
05:26:34.910 --> 05:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
officers or Corrections Officers so that
 
05:26:37.850 --> 05:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
was the other unclear piece that the
 
05:26:39.890 --> 05:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections was concerned
 
05:26:41.510 --> 05:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
about again
 
05:26:45.170 --> 05:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
neutral on the bill but concerned at
 
05:26:48.610 --> 05:26:48.620 align:start position:0%
specific language in the bill so we have
 
05:26:51.650 --> 05:26:51.660 align:start position:0%
expressed some thoughts about changes
 
05:26:53.208 --> 05:26:53.218 align:start position:0%
for the bill
 
05:26:53.218 --> 05:26:54.110 align:start position:0%
for the bill
um

05:26:54.110 --> 05:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:57.490 --> 05:26:57.500 align:start position:0%
and one of those changes not only is to
 
05:27:00.830 --> 05:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
Define broadly more broadly what it
 
05:27:02.650 --> 05:27:02.660 align:start position:0%
means to be a law enforcement officer
 
05:27:06.830 --> 05:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
but change the custodial interrogation
 
05:27:10.310 --> 05:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
definition and then thirdly to exempt
 
05:27:14.270 --> 05:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
specifically and explicitly the any
 
05:27:17.810 --> 05:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
probation parole officer questioning an
 
05:27:20.628 --> 05:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
individual on a technical violation or
 
05:27:22.910 --> 05:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
any individual that's already sentenced
 
05:27:25.910 --> 05:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
in our custody for purposes of an
 
05:27:28.390 --> 05:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
administrative disciplinary infraction
 
05:27:31.310 --> 05:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
if the intent of the bill is not to do
 
05:27:33.530 --> 05:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
those things then we would like that
 
05:27:36.770 --> 05:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
clarified so that there's no argument in
 
05:27:38.990 --> 05:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
the future that it a custodial
 
05:27:41.868 --> 05:27:41.878 align:start position:0%
interrogation could apply in a doc
 
05:27:41.878 --> 05:27:48.590 align:start position:0%
interrogation could apply in a doc
setting

05:27:48.590 --> 05:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:51.170 --> 05:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:28:04.730 --> 05:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:18.530 --> 05:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:21.708 --> 05:28:21.718 align:start position:0%
chair uh my name is sure I'm a police
 
05:28:24.350 --> 05:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner in Portsmouth I'm a law
 
05:28:28.430 --> 05:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
professor at UNH Law And as always uh my
 
05:28:30.470 --> 05:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
opinion to express today are mine and
 
05:28:31.788 --> 05:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
they are not those of either the
 
05:28:34.490 --> 05:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth police commission or UNH law
 
05:28:36.890 --> 05:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
or UNH proper
 
05:28:38.570 --> 05:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
um I
 
05:28:40.970 --> 05:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
to clear up one question that uh
 
05:28:43.730 --> 05:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
representative Roy had the the
 
05:28:47.448 --> 05:28:47.458 align:start position:0%
definition of custodial interrogation uh
 
05:28:52.550 --> 05:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
in 594 a to Roman numeral one is
 
05:28:55.310 --> 05:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
basically an exact quote from the U.S
 
05:28:57.830 --> 05:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case that uh identified
 
05:29:01.310 --> 05:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
what custodial is so it is incomplete
 
05:29:03.948 --> 05:29:03.958 align:start position:0%
Accord with uh with the U.S Supreme
 
05:29:05.868 --> 05:29:05.878 align:start position:0%
Court and and also the New Hampshire
 
05:29:07.910 --> 05:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
05:29:07.920 --> 05:29:08.930 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
um

05:29:08.930 --> 05:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:12.050 --> 05:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
I think uh this is I I testify in
 
05:29:16.190 --> 05:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
support of uh HP uh 1540 ask uh the
 
05:29:17.628 --> 05:29:17.638 align:start position:0%
committee members to vote ought to pass
 
05:29:21.530 --> 05:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
I think for three reasons one uh this
 
05:29:25.368 --> 05:29:25.378 align:start position:0%
bill uh for recording confessions saves
 
05:29:27.410 --> 05:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
time and money for the criminal justice
 
05:29:30.170 --> 05:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
system uh number two it protects police
 
05:29:34.850 --> 05:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
and number three uh it is uh it is
 
05:29:38.150 --> 05:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
suggested as a preferable practice by
 
05:29:40.128 --> 05:29:40.138 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court though
 
05:29:41.570 --> 05:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court has
 
05:29:45.230 --> 05:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
found as a constitutional matter uh
 
05:29:47.570 --> 05:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
recording of confessions is not required
 
05:29:51.590 --> 05:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh but they they expressed uh positive
 
05:29:54.230 --> 05:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
feelings about the the idea of recording
 
05:29:56.150 --> 05:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
confessions so back to number one and
 
05:29:57.830 --> 05:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
this will be the substance of my
 
05:30:01.670 --> 05:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
testimony the major substance um in the
 
05:30:03.948 --> 05:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system there's a a
 
05:30:06.110 --> 05:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
creature known as the emotion to
 
05:30:08.810 --> 05:30:08.820 align:start position:0%
suppress uh that frequently defense
 
05:30:12.288 --> 05:30:12.298 align:start position:0%
lawyers file them uh and allege a
 
05:30:14.868 --> 05:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
constitutional violation and seek to
 
05:30:16.970 --> 05:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
have in this circumstance a confession
 
05:30:19.430 --> 05:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
suppressed uh
 
05:30:23.030 --> 05:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
the huge majority of those motions to
 
05:30:25.970 --> 05:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
suppress a confession under the Fourth
 
05:30:28.550 --> 05:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment or the Fifth Amendment or the
 
05:30:31.910 --> 05:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
sixth amendment uh involved did the did
 
05:30:34.310 --> 05:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
the police read the Miranda Rights
 
05:30:34.320 --> 05:30:35.570 align:start position:0%
the police read the Miranda Rights
properly

05:30:35.570 --> 05:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
properly
 
05:30:38.150 --> 05:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
to the defendant did the defendant
 
05:30:41.448 --> 05:30:41.458 align:start position:0%
actually waive explicitly or implicitly
 
05:30:46.190 --> 05:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
wave their Miranda rights uh did they at
 
05:30:48.170 --> 05:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
any point assert their right to remain
 
05:30:50.930 --> 05:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
silent did they at any point assert
 
05:30:53.510 --> 05:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
their clear and unambiguously their
 
05:30:56.448 --> 05:30:56.458 align:start position:0%
right to counsel by saying you know is
 
05:30:58.730 --> 05:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
this is this the point where maybe I
 
05:31:00.650 --> 05:31:00.660 align:start position:0%
should get a lawyer you know there's all
 
05:31:04.310 --> 05:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
sorts of litigation as I those of you uh
 
05:31:05.690 --> 05:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
on the committee who have been in law
 
05:31:07.550 --> 05:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement you're very familiar with
 
05:31:10.430 --> 05:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
the litigation about well he said you
 
05:31:12.170 --> 05:31:12.180 align:start position:0%
know I probably should get a lawyer now
 
05:31:13.730 --> 05:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
it's how to clear an unambiguous
 
05:31:16.010 --> 05:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
assertion to write the council that's
 
05:31:18.230 --> 05:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
those Miranda issues in particular are
 
05:31:20.868 --> 05:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
litigated all the time
 
05:31:22.970 --> 05:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
if the confessions
 
05:31:25.430 --> 05:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
are recorded and the interrogation is
 
05:31:27.708 --> 05:31:27.718 align:start position:0%
recorded including the Miranda warnings
 
05:31:31.970 --> 05:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
the huge majority of those disappear
 
05:31:35.510 --> 05:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
because it's on the record you know it
 
05:31:39.410 --> 05:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
picks up uh what the words were what the
 
05:31:42.230 --> 05:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
tone of voice was you know unfortunately
 
05:31:45.350 --> 05:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
there is U.S Supreme Court case law that
 
05:31:48.230 --> 05:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
that distinguishes between one saying in
 
05:31:49.670 --> 05:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
terms of whether it's a clear and
 
05:31:52.430 --> 05:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
unambiguous a search invocation of the
 
05:31:53.690 --> 05:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
right to counsel
 
05:31:55.070 --> 05:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
if you say
 
05:31:57.530 --> 05:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
maybe I should get a lawyer question
 
05:31:58.850 --> 05:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
mark at the end
 
05:32:01.730 --> 05:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
versus maybe I should get a lawyer
 
05:32:03.890 --> 05:32:03.900 align:start position:0%
statement no question mark
 
05:32:07.368 --> 05:32:07.378 align:start position:0%
it's just a messy area of the law and
 
05:32:09.470 --> 05:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
fraught with lots of litigation and if
 
05:32:12.730 --> 05:32:12.740 align:start position:0%
you're recording confessions really
 
05:32:16.610 --> 05:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of substance out of that
 
05:32:19.910 --> 05:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
litigation because it's not a he said he
 
05:32:24.110 --> 05:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
said circumstance uh and uh so I you
 
05:32:27.230 --> 05:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
know I think that is a A major benefit
 
05:32:31.250 --> 05:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
of doing this uh it also it also makes
 
05:32:34.430 --> 05:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
it much more likely that a motion to
 
05:32:36.590 --> 05:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
suppress for the uh involuntary
 
05:32:38.510 --> 05:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
confession that the person was coerced
 
05:32:44.030 --> 05:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
into confessing uh will ever will uh you
 
05:32:45.948 --> 05:32:45.958 align:start position:0%
know it will be a lot clearer whether
 
05:32:48.530 --> 05:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
that's the case or not given what
 
05:32:51.410 --> 05:32:51.420 align:start position:0%
occurred and what is visually apparent
 
05:32:54.830 --> 05:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
um number two you know as as uh Ms
 
05:32:56.208 --> 05:32:56.218 align:start position:0%
Roberts has already described it
 
05:32:58.850 --> 05:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
protects the police from frivolous
 
05:33:01.390 --> 05:33:01.400 align:start position:0%
accusations of undue pressure or
 
05:33:03.890 --> 05:33:03.900 align:start position:0%
inappropriate conduct I mean I think
 
05:33:07.128 --> 05:33:07.138 align:start position:0%
that is a a good thing it also by the
 
05:33:09.948 --> 05:33:09.958 align:start position:0%
way if you know if there's less emotions
 
05:33:12.350 --> 05:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
to suppress files filed related to
 
05:33:12.360 --> 05:33:13.490 align:start position:0%
to suppress files filed related to
confessions

05:33:13.490 --> 05:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
confessions
 
05:33:15.830 --> 05:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot less time police officers
 
05:33:17.930 --> 05:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
are going to have to spend in court
 
05:33:22.970 --> 05:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh that saves their time it saves money
 
05:33:25.010 --> 05:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
um if you know if there's really not a
 
05:33:26.868 --> 05:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
contest uh there
 
05:33:29.690 --> 05:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
uh number three I've already said that
 
05:33:31.070 --> 05:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
you at the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
05:33:34.250 --> 05:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
has spoken favorably of recording of
 
05:33:37.190 --> 05:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
confessions though it has as a
 
05:33:39.590 --> 05:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional matter has not adopted
 
05:33:43.788 --> 05:33:43.798 align:start position:0%
that practice uh finally you know as
 
05:33:46.190 --> 05:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
news Roberts said many police uh
 
05:33:48.530 --> 05:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
departments in New Hampshire
 
05:33:52.850 --> 05:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
um already record confessions
 
05:33:56.090 --> 05:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
um and almost all that have body cams
 
05:33:58.910 --> 05:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
now which is an increasing number uh
 
05:34:01.910 --> 05:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
they effectively record
 
05:34:04.310 --> 05:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
um they effectively are recording
 
05:34:04.320 --> 05:34:06.110 align:start position:0%
um they effectively are recording
confessions

05:34:06.110 --> 05:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
confessions
 
05:34:09.230 --> 05:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
um it is I note in one of the fiscal
 
05:34:12.350 --> 05:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
notes that uh
 
05:34:14.448 --> 05:34:14.458 align:start position:0%
there's a suggestion that it would cost
 
05:34:16.430 --> 05:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
twelve thousand dollars well I don't
 
05:34:19.190 --> 05:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
think that that assessment takes into uh
 
05:34:22.190 --> 05:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
into it's by the municipal Association I
 
05:34:22.200 --> 05:34:23.208 align:start position:0%
into it's by the municipal Association I
think

05:34:23.208 --> 05:34:23.218 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:34:24.410 --> 05:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
um they it doesn't take into
 
05:34:26.330 --> 05:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
consideration the fact that many
 
05:34:29.030 --> 05:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
departments already do it
 
05:34:32.150 --> 05:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
um it's not that hard to do if you have
 
05:34:35.208 --> 05:34:35.218 align:start position:0%
a you know if you have a smartphone you
 
05:34:37.670 --> 05:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
can do it if you're a solo Police
 
05:34:39.230 --> 05:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
Department or two people in the police
 
05:34:41.090 --> 05:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
department all you need is a smartphone
 
05:34:44.270 --> 05:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
and the storage costs are minimal
 
05:34:45.948 --> 05:34:45.958 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:34:45.958 --> 05:34:47.510 align:start position:0%
um so
um

05:34:47.510 --> 05:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:49.310 --> 05:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
that's the substance of my testimony
 
05:34:56.270 --> 05:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:57.830 --> 05:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
if the team may inquire with the
 
05:35:00.650 --> 05:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
question and I I appreciate a lot of the
 
05:35:03.230 --> 05:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
points about the judicial economy what
 
05:35:06.530 --> 05:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
but is there any uh thought on
 
05:35:08.390 --> 05:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
especially the video recording side of
 
05:35:10.368 --> 05:35:10.378 align:start position:0%
it of those being dispersed throughout
 
05:35:12.110 --> 05:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
the public
 
05:35:13.550 --> 05:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps maybe just limiting the
 
05:35:14.930 --> 05:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
requirement to audio is really what I
 
05:35:17.690 --> 05:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
was asking well you know I I don't know
 
05:35:19.670 --> 05:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
that if it's part of a police
 
05:35:23.448 --> 05:35:23.458 align:start position:0%
investigation I don't know that at the
 
05:35:25.670 --> 05:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
least until the investigation is over
 
05:35:28.550 --> 05:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
and the case is over it's gonna be ex
 
05:35:30.770 --> 05:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be required to be turned over
 
05:35:33.530 --> 05:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
to the public it's not like uh it's a
 
05:35:34.730 --> 05:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
separate issue when we're talking about
 
05:35:38.030 --> 05:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
body cams generally I think that that's
 
05:35:40.730 --> 05:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
you know many of the body cam encounters
 
05:35:43.550 --> 05:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh do not involve criminal charges and
 
05:35:46.490 --> 05:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
and and so those are on our right to
 
05:35:49.010 --> 05:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
know basis more accessible but but I
 
05:35:50.448 --> 05:35:50.458 align:start position:0%
don't think these recordings that are
 
05:35:53.270 --> 05:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
part of a police investigation or a
 
05:35:55.910 --> 05:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
criminal case until at the least the
 
05:35:57.170 --> 05:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
case is over they're going to be
 
05:35:57.180 --> 05:35:59.448 align:start position:0%
case is over they're going to be
accessible

05:35:59.448 --> 05:35:59.458 align:start position:0%
accessible
 
05:36:01.070 --> 05:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
representative Roy
 
05:36:03.590 --> 05:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:36:05.750 --> 05:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
um what is your opinion regarding the
 
05:36:07.070 --> 05:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
comments from the Department of
 
05:36:10.570 --> 05:36:10.580 align:start position:0%
Corrections regarding the um the
 
05:36:12.830 --> 05:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
interrogation or questioning of inmates
 
05:36:15.708 --> 05:36:15.718 align:start position:0%
who are in the state custody
 
05:36:15.718 --> 05:36:16.850 align:start position:0%
who are in the state custody
um

05:36:16.850 --> 05:36:16.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:20.030 --> 05:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's a good bit of
 
05:36:20.040 --> 05:36:22.610 align:start position:0%
there's there's a good bit of
um

05:36:22.610 --> 05:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:25.628 --> 05:36:25.638 align:start position:0%
U.S Supreme Court and uh other court
 
05:36:29.390 --> 05:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
cases that say somebody who's already in
 
05:36:32.390 --> 05:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
custody isn't in custody for police
 
05:36:35.030 --> 05:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
purposes if they're being interrogated
 
05:36:39.230 --> 05:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
by uh department personnel on the other
 
05:36:42.650 --> 05:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
hand if somebody's in jail on bail and
 
05:36:44.690 --> 05:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
the police go to interview them in the
 
05:36:47.150 --> 05:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
jail that's going to count as custody
 
05:36:49.190 --> 05:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's what the case law said that will
 
05:36:51.650 --> 05:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
count as custody they they don't get and
 
05:36:53.330 --> 05:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
that's what it is meant here they don't
 
05:36:56.750 --> 05:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
get in uh they don't get under the uh so
 
05:36:59.330 --> 05:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
any called so-called exception simply
 
05:37:00.650 --> 05:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
because it's happening in the
 
05:37:05.030 --> 05:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:07.310 --> 05:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
the chairman Inquirer of a question and
 
05:37:10.788 --> 05:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question on
 
05:37:13.670 --> 05:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
on the first page of the bill lines 20
 
05:37:15.410 --> 05:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
to 22
 
05:37:17.628 --> 05:37:17.638 align:start position:0%
excuse me 17 to 19.
 
05:37:19.730 --> 05:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
with the definition of law enforcement
 
05:37:22.430 --> 05:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
officer it ends with ori's security
 
05:37:23.930 --> 05:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
officer employed by an educational
 
05:37:23.940 --> 05:37:25.250 align:start position:0%
officer employed by an educational
Institution

05:37:25.250 --> 05:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
Institution
 
05:37:27.948 --> 05:37:27.958 align:start position:0%
is that referring to University police
 
05:37:30.948 --> 05:37:30.958 align:start position:0%
officers or private security uh uh
 
05:37:36.350 --> 05:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:37.970 --> 05:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
you know I
 
05:37:41.150 --> 05:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
I hadn't thought about like at a school
 
05:37:43.910 --> 05:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
like Dartmouth the security officers
 
05:37:47.810 --> 05:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
there I don't know what powers they have
 
05:37:52.368 --> 05:37:52.378 align:start position:0%
uh under uh in the state who act uh you
 
05:37:55.368 --> 05:37:55.378 align:start position:0%
know to take somebody into custody
 
05:37:59.208 --> 05:37:59.218 align:start position:0%
um so I I'm not sure if it's a security
 
05:38:01.788 --> 05:38:01.798 align:start position:0%
officer at Dartmouth who doesn't have a
 
05:38:04.250 --> 05:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
relationship with the police department
 
05:38:08.030 --> 05:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
in Hanover they even have the power to
 
05:38:10.868 --> 05:38:10.878 align:start position:0%
take somebody into the kind of custody
 
05:38:13.930 --> 05:38:13.940 align:start position:0%
defined in Roman numeral one
 
05:38:18.230 --> 05:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
but uh I can think about that some more
 
05:38:21.530 --> 05:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
and and get back to the committee
 
05:38:25.310 --> 05:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:27.350 --> 05:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony thank
 
05:38:55.628 --> 05:38:55.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:10.550 --> 05:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:12.288 --> 05:39:12.298 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everybody I'm Paul
 
05:39:14.150 --> 05:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
Halverson I'm the Merrimack County
 
05:39:17.030 --> 05:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
attorney the County attorneys throughout
 
05:39:18.948 --> 05:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
the state and myself have had several
 
05:39:22.430 --> 05:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
conversations about this and as written
 
05:39:25.850 --> 05:39:25.860 align:start position:0%
we don't think that this bill should
 
05:39:28.730 --> 05:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
pass as written the handout that I just
 
05:39:31.730 --> 05:39:31.740 align:start position:0%
passed around I'll comment on some of
 
05:39:34.250 --> 05:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
that but that gives an indication of
 
05:39:36.310 --> 05:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
some of the difficulties that we see
 
05:39:39.530 --> 05:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
with this legislation
 
05:39:41.830 --> 05:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
um by way of background there are ample
 
05:39:43.670 --> 05:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional protections that
 
05:39:45.230 --> 05:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
currently exist
 
05:39:47.448 --> 05:39:47.458 align:start position:0%
when you look within the New Hampshire
 
05:39:49.610 --> 05:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
stat statutes particularly a part one
 
05:39:51.230 --> 05:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
article 15.
 
05:39:53.810 --> 05:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
put on Article 15 addresses the rights
 
05:39:56.270 --> 05:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
of an individual regarding questioning
 
05:39:58.730 --> 05:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
that is the amount of footnotes that
 
05:40:01.208 --> 05:40:01.218 align:start position:0%
part 1 Article 15 has regarding legis
 
05:40:05.330 --> 05:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
legal challenges to anything having to
 
05:40:07.610 --> 05:40:07.620 align:start position:0%
do apartment article 15.
 
05:40:10.490 --> 05:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional protections
 
05:40:12.830 --> 05:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
specifically regarding due process and
 
05:40:16.190 --> 05:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
Miranda amount to about 40 pages of
 
05:40:18.230 --> 05:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
individual footnotes
 
05:40:21.410 --> 05:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
when I did a
 
05:40:23.110 --> 05:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
a quick
 
05:40:26.750 --> 05:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
electronic search for certain terms
 
05:40:30.110 --> 05:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
there were 1072 cases having to do with
 
05:40:34.010 --> 05:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
part one article 15. out of that several
 
05:40:36.590 --> 05:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
hundred addressed Miranda statement
 
05:40:38.750 --> 05:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
suppression and audio and video
 
05:40:38.760 --> 05:40:40.310 align:start position:0%
suppression and audio and video
recording

05:40:40.310 --> 05:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
recording
 
05:40:42.350 --> 05:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:40:42.360 --> 05:40:43.368 align:start position:0%
right now
um

05:40:43.368 --> 05:40:43.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:46.190 --> 05:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
I don't believe anyone can Define
 
05:40:48.350 --> 05:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
custodial interrogation because
 
05:40:51.590 --> 05:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
custodial interrogation by the case law
 
05:40:55.190 --> 05:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
is determined on the facts specific
 
05:40:57.110 --> 05:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
to that case
 
05:41:00.470 --> 05:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
you cannot say to any specific set of
 
05:41:02.628 --> 05:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
circumstances is custody without
 
05:41:04.850 --> 05:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
analyzing the entire event
 
05:41:06.230 --> 05:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
on the whole
 
05:41:09.708 --> 05:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
we believe that's a uh that's a problem
 
05:41:11.570 --> 05:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
um with this with this proposed
 
05:41:11.580 --> 05:41:13.850 align:start position:0%
um with this with this proposed
legislation

05:41:13.850 --> 05:41:13.860 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:41:17.628 --> 05:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
um there are certainly best practices
 
05:41:19.368 --> 05:41:19.378 align:start position:0%
and every one of the County attorneys
 
05:41:20.750 --> 05:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
that I know which is which is all of
 
05:41:23.930 --> 05:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
them and the police Chiefs that I know
 
05:41:25.430 --> 05:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
which is a good number here in Merrimack
 
05:41:26.930 --> 05:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
County is we prospered for over 30
 
05:41:29.208 --> 05:41:29.218 align:start position:0%
police departments uh and all the ones
 
05:41:31.010 --> 05:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
I've worked with in other counties to
 
05:41:32.330 --> 05:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
the north because I've worked in many
 
05:41:34.250 --> 05:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
Superior Courts at least four different
 
05:41:36.770 --> 05:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
counties and about maybe a dozen or so
 
05:41:40.368 --> 05:41:40.378 align:start position:0%
uh about eight or so circuit courts uh
 
05:41:42.530 --> 05:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
all the prosecutors I know agreed at the
 
05:41:44.690 --> 05:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
best practice is to record a a a
 
05:41:49.610 --> 05:41:49.620 align:start position:0%
interview in fact the
 
05:41:53.150 --> 05:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
the uh the state supreme court has even
 
05:41:58.430 --> 05:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
issued cases on that 2001 2007 and I
 
05:42:00.530 --> 05:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
addressed those in the second page of
 
05:42:03.730 --> 05:42:03.740 align:start position:0%
the uh of the uh handout that I had
 
05:42:07.190 --> 05:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
indicating that recording is indeed a
 
05:42:10.270 --> 05:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
best practice so there's no doubt that
 
05:42:13.368 --> 05:42:13.378 align:start position:0%
that most police departments should be
 
05:42:15.230 --> 05:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
05:42:17.448 --> 05:42:17.458 align:start position:0%
um many are doing it and it's a best
 
05:42:19.850 --> 05:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
practice but not all departments are
 
05:42:22.310 --> 05:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
capable of of doing it because at a cost
 
05:42:22.320 --> 05:42:23.690 align:start position:0%
capable of of doing it because at a cost
Factor

05:42:23.690 --> 05:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
Factor
 
05:42:23.700 --> 05:42:24.530 align:start position:0%
Factor
um

05:42:24.530 --> 05:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:27.110 --> 05:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
there was a mention of body worn cameras
 
05:42:31.610 --> 05:42:31.620 align:start position:0%
being able to uh to be used I would note
 
05:42:34.010 --> 05:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
that the next bill schedule for uh
 
05:42:35.990 --> 05:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
discussion would actually prohibit the
 
05:42:37.730 --> 05:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
use of body worn cameras inside of a
 
05:42:43.750 --> 05:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
facility to record a a interview under
 
05:42:47.510 --> 05:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh on Miranda and in custody that's
 
05:42:49.368 --> 05:42:49.378 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1600 I believe is scheduled
 
05:42:51.770 --> 05:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
for your next hearing and uh that would
 
05:42:53.150 --> 05:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
actually prohibit use of body worn
 
05:42:55.610 --> 05:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
cameras under certain circumstances
 
05:42:58.368 --> 05:42:58.378 align:start position:0%
um we also believe that there's a a
 
05:43:00.288 --> 05:43:00.298 align:start position:0%
probable challenge to this under under
 
05:43:04.310 --> 05:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
the unfunded mandate portion enumerated
 
05:43:06.948 --> 05:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
within our state constitution that
 
05:43:09.970 --> 05:43:09.980 align:start position:0%
addresses uh mandates by the legislature
 
05:43:12.650 --> 05:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
unfunded with the uh with the lower
 
05:43:16.190 --> 05:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
organizations and we believe that's a a
 
05:43:16.200 --> 05:43:17.208 align:start position:0%
organizations and we believe that's a a
possible

05:43:17.208 --> 05:43:17.218 align:start position:0%
possible
 
05:43:19.430 --> 05:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
challenge to just pending litigation
 
05:43:24.170 --> 05:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
legislation also so I would urge uh for
 
05:43:25.670 --> 05:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
a matter of for the sake of time I would
 
05:43:27.170 --> 05:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
urge you reviewed a document that I
 
05:43:30.050 --> 05:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
prepared for you uh see some of the
 
05:43:34.190 --> 05:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
difficulties that we see as uh as uh
 
05:43:38.628 --> 05:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and um and as written uh we
 
05:43:40.190 --> 05:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
would ask that you're not pass this
 
05:43:43.128 --> 05:43:43.138 align:start position:0%
legislation as presented I'll certainly
 
05:43:45.708 --> 05:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that uh that the
 
05:43:48.170 --> 05:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
committee members may may have on the
 
05:43:50.208 --> 05:43:50.218 align:start position:0%
issue I would ask however when you ask
 
05:43:51.410 --> 05:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
me a question
 
05:43:53.330 --> 05:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
please speak up I'm one of those people
 
05:43:55.430 --> 05:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
after 21 years in the military before I
 
05:43:56.628 --> 05:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
went to law school
 
05:43:59.150 --> 05:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
I have a very profound hearing loss so
 
05:44:00.590 --> 05:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
if you could speak up before so I could
 
05:44:06.170 --> 05:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:11.030 --> 05:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:13.070 --> 05:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
describe what the references that you
 
05:44:14.628 --> 05:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
made at the very beginning to the
 
05:44:16.490 --> 05:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
references with the 40 pages what that
 
05:44:20.090 --> 05:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
is certainly this is um for the recorded
 
05:44:21.470 --> 05:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
record the New Hampshire revised
 
05:44:23.270 --> 05:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
statutes annotated the first volume
 
05:44:25.368 --> 05:44:25.378 align:start position:0%
contains the Constitutions both the
 
05:44:27.890 --> 05:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
United States and uh for the State of
 
05:44:29.510 --> 05:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the state of New Hampshire
 
05:44:31.190 --> 05:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution broken down within parts
 
05:44:33.730 --> 05:44:33.740 align:start position:0%
Part One Article 15
 
05:44:37.250 --> 05:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
is within that bound volume
 
05:44:40.430 --> 05:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
and part one Article 15 as you read it
 
05:44:43.788 --> 05:44:43.798 align:start position:0%
there are a series of um of footnotes
 
05:44:46.310 --> 05:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
and case references the case references
 
05:44:49.670 --> 05:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
that I'm referring to go from page in
 
05:44:51.410 --> 05:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
the volume that I have and this is
 
05:44:53.170 --> 05:44:53.180 align:start position:0%
without reference to the pocket part
 
05:44:55.548 --> 05:44:55.558 align:start position:0%
that has additional references go from
 
05:44:57.850 --> 05:44:57.860 align:start position:0%
page 228 to
 
05:45:00.830 --> 05:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
200 and
 
05:45:04.010 --> 05:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
38 and then there are due process issues
 
05:45:09.590 --> 05:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:13.128 --> 05:45:13.138 align:start position:0%
page 255 to page 278 in the volume that
 
05:45:15.110 --> 05:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
that I have and the volume that I have
 
05:45:18.190 --> 05:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
was printed in 2017. there are certainly
 
05:45:20.090 --> 05:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
supplemental materials that were
 
05:45:22.430 --> 05:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
annotated within the pocket Parts but
 
05:45:25.010 --> 05:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
that addresses all the Constitution uh
 
05:45:27.530 --> 05:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
challenges worthy of note within the
 
05:45:29.030 --> 05:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
bound volume there are certainly many
 
05:45:30.590 --> 05:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
many more that aren't worth that aren't
 
05:45:32.208 --> 05:45:32.218 align:start position:0%
mentioned within the uh within a
 
05:45:38.090 --> 05:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:47.170 --> 05:45:47.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:50.330 --> 05:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
are you a county attorney I am my name
 
05:45:51.830 --> 05:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
is Paul Alverson I'm the Merrimack
 
05:45:52.910 --> 05:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
County attorney
 
05:45:55.730 --> 05:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:57.948 --> 05:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
if the chair can inquire with a question
 
05:45:59.990 --> 05:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question yes
 
05:46:00.000 --> 05:46:01.250 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question yes
sir

05:46:01.250 --> 05:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
sir
 
05:46:03.350 --> 05:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
how would your office handle a situation
 
05:46:07.150 --> 05:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
where the suspect that was arrested
 
05:46:09.830 --> 05:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
objected to being recorded whether video
 
05:46:12.230 --> 05:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
or video and audio
 
05:46:14.270 --> 05:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's Case by case and I I wouldn't
 
05:46:15.948 --> 05:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
want to speculate on how we would handle
 
05:46:18.890 --> 05:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
it because it would initially be a be
 
05:46:20.208 --> 05:46:20.218 align:start position:0%
addressed by the arresting Department
 
05:46:22.128 --> 05:46:22.138 align:start position:0%
how they would handle it so there would
 
05:46:24.230 --> 05:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
be a lot of a lot of other additional
 
05:46:27.048 --> 05:46:27.058 align:start position:0%
facts that would be present that that I
 
05:46:29.150 --> 05:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't I wouldn't want to speculate on
 
05:46:31.730 --> 05:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
and like I said it certainly it
 
05:46:34.730 --> 05:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
certainly best practices to to do a uh a
 
05:46:34.740 --> 05:46:36.530 align:start position:0%
certainly best practices to to do a uh a
recording

05:46:36.530 --> 05:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
recording
 
05:46:38.930 --> 05:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
I'll rephrase the question I suppose if
 
05:46:41.090 --> 05:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
once the person has been gone been
 
05:46:43.128 --> 05:46:43.138 align:start position:0%
interrogated if the case were to then be
 
05:46:45.948 --> 05:46:45.958 align:start position:0%
prosecuted in that circumstance they
 
05:46:48.650 --> 05:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
would if the if the suspect objected to
 
05:46:50.330 --> 05:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
being recorded or videotaped and
 
05:46:50.340 --> 05:46:51.350 align:start position:0%
being recorded or videotaped and
recorded

05:46:51.350 --> 05:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
05:46:53.570 --> 05:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
and in that case that the way this is
 
05:46:55.010 --> 05:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
written it would be a presumption that
 
05:46:58.490 --> 05:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
that interrogation not be admissible
 
05:47:00.830 --> 05:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
I guess how would you approach a case
 
05:47:02.270 --> 05:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
like that if you came across it there's
 
05:47:03.590 --> 05:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
an argument to be made
 
05:47:05.150 --> 05:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
to party States so we can't record
 
05:47:07.730 --> 05:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
something if someone uh
 
05:47:09.350 --> 05:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh generally speaking if someone objects
 
05:47:11.330 --> 05:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
to the recording uh there are exceptions
 
05:47:13.190 --> 05:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
to uh doing that
 
05:47:15.230 --> 05:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
um so the argument can be made I believe
 
05:47:17.810 --> 05:47:17.820 align:start position:0%
that if the individual objects to a
 
05:47:19.610 --> 05:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
recording if a recording is made for
 
05:47:22.430 --> 05:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
showing to the uh to the statute that
 
05:47:24.048 --> 05:47:24.058 align:start position:0%
they could ask to keep that recording
 
05:47:26.448 --> 05:47:26.458 align:start position:0%
out that's my understanding of uh of the
 
05:47:29.690 --> 05:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
two-party consent within New Hampshire
 
05:47:34.850 --> 05:47:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:37.190 --> 05:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
05:47:39.350 --> 05:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:47:41.150 --> 05:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
my question yes sir you just you just
 
05:47:42.288 --> 05:47:42.298 align:start position:0%
quote quoted the New Hampshire
 
05:47:45.410 --> 05:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
Constitution part one Article 15 yes are
 
05:47:46.970 --> 05:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
you saying
 
05:47:49.730 --> 05:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
this bill is against goes against that
 
05:47:52.548 --> 05:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
part of the Constitution certainly not
 
05:47:54.590 --> 05:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
um the bill provides
 
05:47:57.890 --> 05:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
statutory protections that I believe are
 
05:47:59.750 --> 05:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
already contained within the
 
05:48:01.910 --> 05:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
Constitutional protections Within part
 
05:48:04.070 --> 05:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
one Article 15 as well as U.S
 
05:48:07.310 --> 05:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional protections
 
05:48:09.770 --> 05:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
um uh and I we believe those are
 
05:48:12.110 --> 05:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
adequate as they are uh now certainly as
 
05:48:14.030 --> 05:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
I mentioned that there could certainly
 
05:48:16.788 --> 05:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
be additional best practices mandated by
 
05:48:19.070 --> 05:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
the legislation or police standards and
 
05:48:21.430 --> 05:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
training whoever administrative whatever
 
05:48:25.570 --> 05:48:25.580 align:start position:0%
but uh we don't believe this statutory
 
05:48:28.070 --> 05:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
provision as it's written is uh is
 
05:48:28.080 --> 05:48:31.910 align:start position:0%
provision as it's written is uh is
needed

05:48:31.910 --> 05:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:34.850 --> 05:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
representative Conley thank you
 
05:48:38.750 --> 05:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
us understand what percentage of uh
 
05:48:41.510 --> 05:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
I guess custodial interviews or
 
05:48:43.970 --> 05:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
interrogations your office encounters
 
05:48:46.190 --> 05:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
that are not recorded like what's the
 
05:48:48.288 --> 05:48:48.298 align:start position:0%
breakdown as far as the percentage of
 
05:48:49.910 --> 05:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
departments that follow what you
 
05:48:51.470 --> 05:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
describe as best practices in the
 
05:48:52.970 --> 05:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
department that don't follow those best
 
05:48:52.980 --> 05:48:55.788 align:start position:0%
department that don't follow those best
practices

05:48:55.788 --> 05:48:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:57.708 --> 05:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
you know I'd be reluctant to put a
 
05:49:00.048 --> 05:49:00.058 align:start position:0%
number on it because
 
05:49:03.650 --> 05:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
my experience has been I can tell you my
 
05:49:06.650 --> 05:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
experience the vast majority of ones
 
05:49:11.270 --> 05:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:13.070 --> 05:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
where there was an interview at the
 
05:49:17.150 --> 05:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
police station War recorded
 
05:49:18.708 --> 05:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
um I'm speaking mainly for the city of
 
05:49:20.690 --> 05:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
Concord they do a very good job of uh of
 
05:49:22.910 --> 05:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
recording our interviews
 
05:49:22.920 --> 05:49:23.628 align:start position:0%
recording our interviews
um

05:49:23.628 --> 05:49:23.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:25.548 --> 05:49:25.558 align:start position:0%
but I'd be reluctant to put a number on
 
05:49:28.970 --> 05:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
it and I I don't mean to be wishy-washy
 
05:49:31.128 --> 05:49:31.138 align:start position:0%
about it but I it's just something that
 
05:49:33.890 --> 05:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
that I just never kept kept kept tabs
 
05:49:33.900 --> 05:49:34.610 align:start position:0%
that I just never kept kept kept tabs
about

05:49:34.610 --> 05:49:34.620 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:49:36.770 --> 05:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
but I will say that the majority of ones
 
05:49:40.548 --> 05:49:40.558 align:start position:0%
that I've had were probably recorded
 
05:49:42.948 --> 05:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
the exceptions might be
 
05:49:42.958 --> 05:49:44.110 align:start position:0%
the exceptions might be
um

05:49:44.110 --> 05:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:47.530 --> 05:49:47.540 align:start position:0%
roadside post arrest
 
05:49:51.170 --> 05:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
post arrest discussions roadside they
 
05:49:54.170 --> 05:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
might not be re recorded items such as
 
05:49:54.180 --> 05:49:55.128 align:start position:0%
might not be re recorded items such as
that

05:49:55.128 --> 05:49:55.138 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:49:57.530 --> 05:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
but generally speaking I would note the
 
05:49:59.930 --> 05:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
majority of those were that I remember
 
05:50:02.150 --> 05:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
were reinforced by a recorded statement
 
05:50:04.970 --> 05:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
later and there's also under the
 
05:50:09.170 --> 05:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
Constitutional protections if a if a
 
05:50:09.180 --> 05:50:10.610 align:start position:0%
Constitutional protections if a if a
initial

05:50:10.610 --> 05:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
initial
 
05:50:13.430 --> 05:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
statement by an individual is suppressed
 
05:50:15.530 --> 05:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
for some reason that's suppressed
 
05:50:18.110 --> 05:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
statement if later recorded and there's
 
05:50:22.730 --> 05:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
a a relief to the pressure that was
 
05:50:25.430 --> 05:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
placed on the individual to begin with
 
05:50:27.410 --> 05:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
um that statement could later be
 
05:50:27.420 --> 05:50:28.670 align:start position:0%
um that statement could later be
admitted

05:50:28.670 --> 05:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
admitted
 
05:50:28.680 --> 05:50:29.510 align:start position:0%
admitted
um

05:50:29.510 --> 05:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:31.730 --> 05:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
if those uh
 
05:50:34.208 --> 05:50:34.218 align:start position:0%
first encounter
 
05:50:36.170 --> 05:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
circumstances are not present that
 
05:50:37.548 --> 05:50:37.558 align:start position:0%
circles right back to what I mentioned
 
05:50:39.708 --> 05:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
earlier about about the the
 
05:50:41.628 --> 05:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
admissibility of a statement is very
 
05:50:41.638 --> 05:50:45.368 align:start position:0%
admissibility of a statement is very
circumstantial

05:50:45.368 --> 05:50:45.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:47.448 --> 05:50:47.458 align:start position:0%
representative Roy
 
05:50:48.948 --> 05:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:50:50.570 --> 05:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:50:50.580 --> 05:50:52.070 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

05:50:52.070 --> 05:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:55.190 --> 05:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
so some police tactics uh my
 
05:50:57.650 --> 05:50:57.660 align:start position:0%
understanding is in order to
 
05:50:57.660 --> 05:50:58.548 align:start position:0%
understanding is in order to
um

05:50:58.548 --> 05:50:58.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:01.730 --> 05:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
not necessarily a void but not to set
 
05:51:04.970 --> 05:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
off alarm is to Avo interview suspects
 
05:51:07.430 --> 05:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
in places that they would not deem to be
 
05:51:10.190 --> 05:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
in custody such as at a coffee shop or
 
05:51:10.200 --> 05:51:11.448 align:start position:0%
in custody such as at a coffee shop or
something

05:51:11.448 --> 05:51:11.458 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:51:16.970 --> 05:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
if this law were in place in all
 
05:51:18.948 --> 05:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
interrogations that took place within
 
05:51:21.230 --> 05:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
the police station would that not have a
 
05:51:23.208 --> 05:51:23.218 align:start position:0%
a chilling effect on the on the
 
05:51:25.250 --> 05:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
interrogations of that place outside of
 
05:51:27.288 --> 05:51:27.298 align:start position:0%
custodial interrogation where the court
 
05:51:29.150 --> 05:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
might take a dim view on those I guess
 
05:51:31.128 --> 05:51:31.138 align:start position:0%
the I guess the bigger com conversation
 
05:51:33.770 --> 05:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
the bigger analysis would would be would
 
05:51:35.750 --> 05:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
that type of conversation be a custodial
 
05:51:35.760 --> 05:51:37.010 align:start position:0%
that type of conversation be a custodial
interrogation

05:51:37.010 --> 05:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
interrogation
 
05:51:39.948 --> 05:51:39.958 align:start position:0%
and there are many things going on when
 
05:51:42.230 --> 05:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
you evaluate a custodial interrogation
 
05:51:45.230 --> 05:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
was there a seizure and a seizure is not
 
05:51:47.570 --> 05:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
the same as custody was there custody
 
05:51:49.910 --> 05:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
and was there interrogation and as I
 
05:51:51.230 --> 05:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned before those are all very
 
05:51:53.448 --> 05:51:53.458 align:start position:0%
situational and I I wouldn't want to
 
05:51:53.458 --> 05:51:54.530 align:start position:0%
situational and I I wouldn't want to
speculate

05:51:54.530 --> 05:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
speculate
 
05:51:56.628 --> 05:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
on a general question what a court would
 
05:51:59.030 --> 05:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
or would not do regarding that
 
05:52:00.410 --> 05:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:52:02.868 --> 05:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
but you know I would comment though on
 
05:52:05.628 --> 05:52:05.638 align:start position:0%
your question it gives rise to the
 
05:52:08.570 --> 05:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question of of since there's
 
05:52:10.610 --> 05:52:10.620 align:start position:0%
so much well-settled constitutional law
 
05:52:14.150 --> 05:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
on on the issue would this statute by
 
05:52:17.270 --> 05:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
enacting it bring about statutory
 
05:52:17.280 --> 05:52:19.070 align:start position:0%
enacting it bring about statutory
challenges

05:52:19.070 --> 05:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
05:52:21.230 --> 05:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
that are separate and distinct from
 
05:52:23.208 --> 05:52:23.218 align:start position:0%
constitutional challenges
 
05:52:26.330 --> 05:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
and drive additional litigation that
 
05:52:27.830 --> 05:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
generally were covered by a prior
 
05:52:30.708 --> 05:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
constitutional challenges and um I I
 
05:52:36.708 --> 05:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:38.270 --> 05:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
05:52:43.730 --> 05:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:45.770 --> 05:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
at this time that chair recognizes Dan
 
05:52:45.780 --> 05:52:58.610 align:start position:0%
at this time that chair recognizes Dan
Conley

05:52:58.610 --> 05:52:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:00.708 --> 05:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman and committee
 
05:53:02.990 --> 05:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
members thank you for having me
 
05:53:06.410 --> 05:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan Conley I am a captain
 
05:53:08.570 --> 05:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
with the Goffstown Police Department
 
05:53:10.788 --> 05:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
and I'm the executive officer and
 
05:53:12.430 --> 05:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
prosecuting attorney for our department
 
05:53:14.750 --> 05:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here today on behalf of the New
 
05:53:16.190 --> 05:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of chiefs of
 
05:53:16.200 --> 05:53:17.510 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of chiefs of
police

05:53:17.510 --> 05:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
police
 
05:53:20.628 --> 05:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
and we opposed this bill as written we
 
05:53:22.910 --> 05:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
certainly understand the desire to
 
05:53:26.448 --> 05:53:26.458 align:start position:0%
record all custodial interrogations and
 
05:53:28.610 --> 05:53:28.620 align:start position:0%
um as County attorney said it is a you
 
05:53:30.890 --> 05:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
know in some places best practice
 
05:53:32.868 --> 05:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
however there's uh
 
05:53:36.530 --> 05:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
quite a few obstacles in this bill
 
05:53:38.690 --> 05:53:38.700 align:start position:0%
um you know and first off is uh you know
 
05:53:41.990 --> 05:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
the suspect's right to privacy you know
 
05:53:44.270 --> 05:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
numerous times when we sit down to
 
05:53:46.310 --> 05:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
interview someone in the police station
 
05:53:47.990 --> 05:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
in Goffstown Police Department is
 
05:53:49.850 --> 05:53:49.860 align:start position:0%
fortunate that we have two rooms that
 
05:53:51.650 --> 05:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
are set up with um
 
05:53:54.850 --> 05:53:54.860 align:start position:0%
audio and visual recording capabilities
 
05:53:58.070 --> 05:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
they will ask us not to record this not
 
05:54:00.948 --> 05:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
to not to record this in any way
 
05:54:00.958 --> 05:54:01.970 align:start position:0%
to not to record this in any way
um

05:54:01.970 --> 05:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:04.430 --> 05:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
if this bill is in place
 
05:54:07.368 --> 05:54:07.378 align:start position:0%
a defendant's or suspect's right to to
 
05:54:09.770 --> 05:54:09.780 align:start position:0%
ask us not to record him now there's a
 
05:54:12.230 --> 05:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
presentable uh presumption that any
 
05:54:13.910 --> 05:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
statements he's made to us because he
 
05:54:15.890 --> 05:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
asked us not to record
 
05:54:19.070 --> 05:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:20.690 --> 05:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
um and like I said while this is
 
05:54:23.990 --> 05:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
available in two of our rooms
 
05:54:26.390 --> 05:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
um not all police stations is state of
 
05:54:28.970 --> 05:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
that fortunate
 
05:54:31.730 --> 05:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
outside of that there are many different
 
05:54:31.740 --> 05:54:33.230 align:start position:0%
outside of that there are many different
places

05:54:33.230 --> 05:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
places
 
05:54:35.690 --> 05:54:35.700 align:start position:0%
that a custodial interrogation
 
05:54:37.070 --> 05:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
um and and I do
 
05:54:37.080 --> 05:54:38.570 align:start position:0%
um and and I do
um

05:54:38.570 --> 05:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:40.970 --> 05:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
want to say do we have to do have an
 
05:54:43.128 --> 05:54:43.138 align:start position:0%
issue with the definition of custodial
 
05:54:46.310 --> 05:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
interrogation as as written in this bill
 
05:54:48.048 --> 05:54:48.058 align:start position:0%
um these these interviews take can take
 
05:54:49.788 --> 05:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
place in many different places within
 
05:54:51.708 --> 05:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
the police station in the sally port in
 
05:54:53.448 --> 05:54:53.458 align:start position:0%
the booking room area the police station
 
05:54:53.458 --> 05:54:55.010 align:start position:0%
the booking room area the police station
Lobby

05:54:55.010 --> 05:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
Lobby
 
05:54:55.020 --> 05:54:55.850 align:start position:0%
Lobby
um

05:54:55.850 --> 05:54:55.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:58.250 --> 05:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh police officers personal office with
 
05:55:00.010 --> 05:55:00.020 align:start position:0%
inside the police department
 
05:55:03.288 --> 05:55:03.298 align:start position:0%
we do have two rooms that are audio and
 
05:55:06.190 --> 05:55:06.200 align:start position:0%
visual recorded capabilities
 
05:55:09.170 --> 05:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
to get to that room they need access to
 
05:55:11.270 --> 05:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
the detectives Division and they need to
 
05:55:13.070 --> 05:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
physically start and end that recording
 
05:55:15.010 --> 05:55:15.020 align:start position:0%
if they don't have access to that
 
05:55:17.448 --> 05:55:17.458 align:start position:0%
which that that division is locked if
 
05:55:18.948 --> 05:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
there's no detective in there because of
 
05:55:20.448 --> 05:55:20.458 align:start position:0%
the the files that are kept in there
 
05:55:22.010 --> 05:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
that are sensitive that has to be locked
 
05:55:25.490 --> 05:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
they're unable to activate that
 
05:55:25.500 --> 05:55:27.048 align:start position:0%
they're unable to activate that
um

05:55:27.048 --> 05:55:27.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:29.270 --> 05:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
much like the like I said it's an
 
05:55:31.250 --> 05:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
independent digital auto recording um
 
05:55:32.510 --> 05:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
the files from the interview must be
 
05:55:35.510 --> 05:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
taken off the the networks uh hard drive
 
05:55:37.970 --> 05:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
and transferred to our department server
 
05:55:42.110 --> 05:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
we've worked um hard at funding that if
 
05:55:44.270 --> 05:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
this is put into place
 
05:55:45.708 --> 05:55:45.718 align:start position:0%
um you know as noted by the New
 
05:55:47.208 --> 05:55:47.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of counties the
 
05:55:48.830 --> 05:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
cost of approximately twelve thousand
 
05:55:51.170 --> 05:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
eight hundred dollars per recording and
 
05:55:52.610 --> 05:55:52.620 align:start position:0%

05:55:57.048 --> 05:55:57.058 align:start position:0%
um record retention audio retention that
 
05:56:00.470 --> 05:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
that stuff costs a lot of money we deal
 
05:56:01.788 --> 05:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
with it every year trying to find money
 
05:56:04.310 --> 05:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
in the budget to find the uh the place
 
05:56:06.230 --> 05:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
to put these
 
05:56:06.240 --> 05:56:06.890 align:start position:0%
to put these
um

05:56:06.890 --> 05:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:10.910 --> 05:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
these uh these recordings and if this is
 
05:56:12.170 --> 05:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
put into place this is an unfunded
 
05:56:15.048 --> 05:56:15.058 align:start position:0%
mandate this is going to put a a big big
 
05:56:17.448 --> 05:56:17.458 align:start position:0%
problem for us that that don't have
 
05:56:20.030 --> 05:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
these capabilities
 
05:56:22.670 --> 05:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
and the access even when even though we
 
05:56:24.230 --> 05:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
have two rooms at the Goffstown Police
 
05:56:24.240 --> 05:56:25.548 align:start position:0%
have two rooms at the Goffstown Police
Department

05:56:25.548 --> 05:56:25.558 align:start position:0%
Department
 
05:56:27.650 --> 05:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
if they're being used or they don't have
 
05:56:29.150 --> 05:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
access to get in there and start the
 
05:56:31.850 --> 05:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
auto recording devices
 
05:56:33.830 --> 05:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
now that interview can't take take place
 
05:56:35.330 --> 05:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in there
 
05:56:38.390 --> 05:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
if State Police they knew they they are
 
05:56:40.250 --> 05:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
um they make an arrest they use all
 
05:56:41.510 --> 05:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of different police departments
 
05:56:45.230 --> 05:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
and to book and process uh prisoners
 
05:56:47.510 --> 05:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
if they they go to a police station that
 
05:56:48.948 --> 05:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't have those capabilities what are
 
05:56:50.930 --> 05:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
they going to do if they come to our our
 
05:56:52.250 --> 05:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
Police Department that has those
 
05:56:53.690 --> 05:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
capabilities but it's only in the
 
05:56:55.070 --> 05:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
detectives room and they can't get to
 
05:56:56.930 --> 05:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
those detectives rooms they're going to
 
05:56:59.810 --> 05:56:59.820 align:start position:0%
run into a similar problem there
 
05:57:02.810 --> 05:57:02.820 align:start position:0%
um but like I said as as this is written
 
05:57:04.548 --> 05:57:04.558 align:start position:0%
for the for the obstacles this is going
 
05:57:07.250 --> 05:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
to bring if mandated
 
05:57:09.410 --> 05:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
um in the funding the funding aspect of
 
05:57:12.470 --> 05:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
this um we oppose it as written
 
05:57:15.590 --> 05:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:18.650 --> 05:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
05:57:21.470 --> 05:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
I I just have a question on the uh on
 
05:57:22.490 --> 05:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:57:24.770 --> 05:57:24.780 align:start position:0%
your statement about
 
05:57:28.368 --> 05:57:28.378 align:start position:0%
the intimate the way it's written you
 
05:57:30.410 --> 05:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
would have inadmissible evidence if you
 
05:57:32.030 --> 05:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
did you would not be able to bring
 
05:57:35.628 --> 05:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
evidence in and I'm wondering how if you
 
05:57:37.490 --> 05:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
could tell me how
 
05:57:39.708 --> 05:57:39.718 align:start position:0%
the section that I was able to find
 
05:57:41.448 --> 05:57:41.458 align:start position:0%
because it was in the bill that I was
 
05:57:43.190 --> 05:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
05:57:45.470 --> 05:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
um overcoming the presumption of
 
05:57:48.530 --> 05:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
inadmissibility how does that relate to
 
05:57:52.490 --> 05:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:54.530 --> 05:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
like like I said if
 
05:57:58.490 --> 05:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
there's a presumption of inadmissibility
 
05:58:01.610 --> 05:58:01.620 align:start position:0%
even if there's just because a defendant
 
05:58:03.110 --> 05:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
can say I don't want to be recorded not
 
05:58:06.110 --> 05:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
as a presumption of inadmissibility
 
05:58:06.120 --> 05:58:06.890 align:start position:0%
as a presumption of inadmissibility
um

05:58:06.890 --> 05:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:11.090 --> 05:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
it just it really so
 
05:58:15.230 --> 05:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
I I just don't I don't see how that
 
05:58:17.150 --> 05:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
without anything more
 
05:58:19.970 --> 05:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
just just because it's not recorded so
 
05:58:23.030 --> 05:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:25.610 --> 05:58:25.620 align:start position:0%
there's no trust there's no Candor
 
05:58:29.628 --> 05:58:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:32.810 --> 05:58:32.820 align:start position:0%
you know there's no um unless words a
 
05:58:34.788 --> 05:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
police officers report a police
 
05:58:36.770 --> 05:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
officer's testimony you're telling me is
 
05:58:39.410 --> 05:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
no good just because it's not recorded
 
05:58:41.690 --> 05:58:41.700 align:start position:0%
is that that's the way it's written
 
05:58:45.650 --> 05:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:49.750 --> 05:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:59.690 --> 05:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:02.390 --> 05:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
Prospect has the right to refuse to be
 
05:59:02.400 --> 05:59:03.770 align:start position:0%
Prospect has the right to refuse to be
recorded

05:59:03.770 --> 05:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
05:59:06.410 --> 05:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
they often well yeah I think every
 
05:59:09.048 --> 05:59:09.058 align:start position:0%
suspect has a privacy right uh to some
 
05:59:12.350 --> 05:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
degree and they often ask us when we we
 
05:59:12.360 --> 05:59:13.850 align:start position:0%
degree and they often ask us when we we
are

05:59:13.850 --> 05:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:59:15.410 --> 05:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
conducting an interview we will tell
 
05:59:18.288 --> 05:59:18.298 align:start position:0%
them is it okay if we Auto record this
 
05:59:20.510 --> 05:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
we start out with that
 
05:59:22.850 --> 05:59:22.860 align:start position:0%
um and it's a good amount of times they
 
05:59:24.548 --> 05:59:24.558 align:start position:0%
say no
 
05:59:30.830 --> 05:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:32.570 --> 05:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
representative Conley
 
05:59:34.070 --> 05:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
05:59:34.080 --> 05:59:36.170 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
question

05:59:36.170 --> 05:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:59:38.690 --> 05:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised that in something as
 
05:59:41.868 --> 05:59:41.878 align:start position:0%
serious as interrogating a suspect that
 
05:59:46.910 --> 05:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:50.110 --> 05:59:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:53.570 --> 05:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
it was more of a comment and I apologize
 
05:59:54.650 --> 05:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
for that
 
05:59:54.660 --> 05:59:59.930 align:start position:0%
for that
um

05:59:59.930 --> 05:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:03.288 --> 06:00:03.298 align:start position:0%
I'm curious I find it surprising that a
 
06:00:03.298 --> 06:00:04.490 align:start position:0%
I'm curious I find it surprising that a
suspect

06:00:04.490 --> 06:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
suspect
 
06:00:06.230 --> 06:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
um and could you help me understand why
 
06:00:08.270 --> 06:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
that's the case
 
06:00:11.208 --> 06:00:11.218 align:start position:0%
are you asking me why they say no
 
06:00:13.190 --> 06:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
forgive me
 
06:00:15.470 --> 06:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
I am could you help me understand why a
 
06:00:17.510 --> 06:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
suspect who is potentially accused of a
 
06:00:19.788 --> 06:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
crime who's being interrogated police
 
06:00:22.730 --> 06:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
would be given the choice in this matter
 
06:00:25.070 --> 06:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
and why the police would not
 
06:00:26.930 --> 06:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
dictate to them that the interview is
 
06:00:29.150 --> 06:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
being recorded
 
06:00:32.690 --> 06:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
we try to we try to respect them and uh
 
06:00:34.128 --> 06:00:34.138 align:start position:0%
build a rapport with them and we're
 
06:00:35.330 --> 06:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
honest with them we're gonna let them
 
06:00:37.190 --> 06:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
know that you're being already recorded
 
06:00:39.170 --> 06:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
We're Not Gonna if we'd sit there and
 
06:00:40.610 --> 06:00:40.620 align:start position:0%
we'd dictate to them what they're going
 
06:00:42.830 --> 06:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
to do it's pretty unlikely they're going
 
06:00:45.170 --> 06:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
to have any rapport with us or talk to
 
06:00:45.180 --> 06:00:56.150 align:start position:0%
to have any rapport with us or talk to
us

06:00:56.150 --> 06:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:58.190 --> 06:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative Platt
 
06:01:00.410 --> 06:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh representative Fred plett from goth
 
06:01:00.420 --> 06:01:01.430 align:start position:0%
uh representative Fred plett from goth
Style

06:01:01.430 --> 06:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
Style
 
06:01:03.708 --> 06:01:03.718 align:start position:0%
fine thanks I'm surprised you have two
 
06:01:05.570 --> 06:01:05.580 align:start position:0%
rooms in there this given this tiny
 
06:01:06.830 --> 06:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
footprint you have for that police
 
06:01:11.570 --> 06:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:15.530 --> 06:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:19.190 --> 06:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask a a question so
 
06:01:23.090 --> 06:01:23.100 align:start position:0%
um we heard testimony that you know and
 
06:01:24.770 --> 06:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
and we both know you can go to Walmart
 
06:01:28.128 --> 06:01:28.138 align:start position:0%
and pick up a a video recorder for 50
 
06:01:31.070 --> 06:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
bucks and you can burn those on the DVDs
 
06:01:33.650 --> 06:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
so we heard testimony that it's not that
 
06:01:35.628 --> 06:01:35.638 align:start position:0%
expensive so
 
06:01:37.548 --> 06:01:37.558 align:start position:0%
um could you speak to that you said that
 
06:01:39.948 --> 06:01:39.958 align:start position:0%
it would be cost prohibitive how so you
 
06:01:42.590 --> 06:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
know maybe the the individual device
 
06:01:47.390 --> 06:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
may not be expensive but to retain that
 
06:01:49.128 --> 06:01:49.138 align:start position:0%
that file
 
06:01:52.610 --> 06:01:52.620 align:start position:0%
um cloud cloud space Cloud retention and
 
06:01:55.730 --> 06:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
to guarantee the the safe retention of
 
06:01:58.490 --> 06:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
that and to guarantee the safe you know
 
06:02:02.030 --> 06:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
authenticity of that recording you can't
 
06:02:04.490 --> 06:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
be just you know recording this on a
 
06:02:06.590 --> 06:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
personal cell phone
 
06:02:08.690 --> 06:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
um where there's no you know your body
 
06:02:11.030 --> 06:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
warm cameras for instance
 
06:02:13.368 --> 06:02:13.378 align:start position:0%
um 105 D2
 
06:02:15.350 --> 06:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
it it mandates
 
06:02:17.990 --> 06:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
the retention period how it's done and
 
06:02:20.448 --> 06:02:20.458 align:start position:0%
it's spelled just to go you know go grab
 
06:02:22.788 --> 06:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
a cheap recorder and then what do we get
 
06:02:26.090 --> 06:02:26.100 align:start position:0%
I mean yes it costs money so it is uh it
 
06:02:29.448 --> 06:02:29.458 align:start position:0%
is a fund but the the greater
 
06:02:29.458 --> 06:02:30.410 align:start position:0%
is a fund but the the greater
um

06:02:30.410 --> 06:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:32.448 --> 06:02:32.458 align:start position:0%
the greater budget item is the retention
 
06:02:34.670 --> 06:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
of these files because we're not keeping
 
06:02:36.288 --> 06:02:36.298 align:start position:0%
these for a week
 
06:02:37.490 --> 06:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
um you know sometimes they're kept for
 
06:02:39.830 --> 06:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
years most times they are especially in
 
06:02:42.410 --> 06:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
the big cases they're kept for 10 10
 
06:02:44.390 --> 06:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
plus years and and that that costs money
 
06:02:46.788 --> 06:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
to keep that storage
 
06:02:58.010 --> 06:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:00.350 --> 06:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
this is a general question not just for
 
06:03:02.510 --> 06:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
your gosh down
 
06:03:05.990 --> 06:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
do most police people interrogating or
 
06:03:09.048 --> 06:03:09.058 align:start position:0%
interviewing a suspect ask them if they
 
06:03:12.048 --> 06:03:12.058 align:start position:0%
want to be recorded and is if they say
 
06:03:15.230 --> 06:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
no uh the recording stop in general
 
06:03:17.150 --> 06:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions in the state of New
 
06:03:17.160 --> 06:03:18.288 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions in the state of New
Hampshire

06:03:18.288 --> 06:03:18.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:03:22.190 --> 06:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
I I can't speak for other departments I
 
06:03:24.048 --> 06:03:24.058 align:start position:0%
can speak for
 
06:03:26.448 --> 06:03:26.458 align:start position:0%
um you know when when you get to those
 
06:03:28.850 --> 06:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
situations where where they're asked to
 
06:03:30.470 --> 06:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
be recorded they're usually being
 
06:03:32.150 --> 06:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
brought in by a detective they go in the
 
06:03:33.890 --> 06:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
detector and then it's awesome and we're
 
06:03:35.330 --> 06:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
going to be audio video recording do you
 
06:03:37.970 --> 06:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that and
 
06:03:40.010 --> 06:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
when they do say no they do stop it
 
06:03:41.628 --> 06:03:41.638 align:start position:0%
because they respect their wishes and
 
06:03:43.310 --> 06:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
you know they're they're trying to build
 
06:03:45.708 --> 06:03:45.718 align:start position:0%
a rapport and talk to this suspect so
 
06:03:47.570 --> 06:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
like I said we're not gonna if they wish
 
06:03:49.128 --> 06:03:49.138 align:start position:0%
to not be recorded we'll stop that
 
06:03:49.138 --> 06:03:51.948 align:start position:0%
to not be recorded we'll stop that
recording

06:03:51.948 --> 06:03:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:55.730 --> 06:03:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:00.288 --> 06:04:00.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:00.298 --> 06:04:01.448 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:04:01.448 --> 06:04:01.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:04.430 --> 06:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
they're in the bill itself it says that
 
06:04:05.868 --> 06:04:05.878 align:start position:0%
if there's clear and convincing evidence
 
06:04:09.350 --> 06:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
that that the statement was voluntary
 
06:04:11.090 --> 06:04:11.100 align:start position:0%
and reliable
 
06:04:14.150 --> 06:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
if you if someone signed a document that
 
06:04:15.590 --> 06:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
said that they did not want to be
 
06:04:17.330 --> 06:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
recorded and that was kept would there
 
06:04:19.490 --> 06:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
be a big burden caused by keeping a
 
06:04:22.010 --> 06:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
statement like that showed that
 
06:04:24.170 --> 06:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
that the interrogation was taken
 
06:04:32.170 --> 06:04:32.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:35.150 --> 06:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
would it be a burden to have them sign a
 
06:04:36.830 --> 06:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
form that they don't want to be recorded
 
06:04:38.810 --> 06:04:38.820 align:start position:0%
that the basically that's kind of what
 
06:04:40.190 --> 06:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
I'm asking I don't think it would be a
 
06:04:45.770 --> 06:04:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:47.090 --> 06:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
there'd be enough for the questions
 
06:04:58.868 --> 06:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:02.030 --> 06:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
I think so like Daryl just got up and
 
06:05:04.670 --> 06:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:06.590 --> 06:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
is anyone else who hasn't filled out a
 
06:05:06.600 --> 06:05:14.690 align:start position:0%
is anyone else who hasn't filled out a
oh

06:05:14.690 --> 06:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:26.288 --> 06:05:26.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:31.788 --> 06:05:31.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:31.798 --> 06:05:34.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:05:34.250 --> 06:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:37.070 --> 06:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you at the risk of drawing the ire
 
06:05:38.868 --> 06:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
of everyone on a Friday afternoon I
 
06:05:41.390 --> 06:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
thought uh I may be able to provide some
 
06:05:43.970 --> 06:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
information so I uh again my name is Joe
 
06:05:47.150 --> 06:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
Ebert it's Ebert I am a captain with the
 
06:05:48.350 --> 06:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
state police overseeing our
 
06:05:50.868 --> 06:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
Investigative Services Bureau uh two
 
06:05:53.090 --> 06:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
things that I want to touch on the first
 
06:05:55.970 --> 06:05:55.980 align:start position:0%
is uh representative Roy you would uh
 
06:05:59.390 --> 06:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
asked a question about the recording of
 
06:06:01.788 --> 06:06:01.798 align:start position:0%
a conversation one thing I wanted to
 
06:06:04.368 --> 06:06:04.378 align:start position:0%
address is that the recording of the
 
06:06:05.930 --> 06:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
conversation is often the least
 
06:06:08.570 --> 06:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
expensive although it depends on what
 
06:06:09.890 --> 06:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
mechanism and what you're you're
 
06:06:13.310 --> 06:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
choosing to do that but it is the uh
 
06:06:15.410 --> 06:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
what happens to that recording afterward
 
06:06:17.150 --> 06:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
and the security that is placed on that
 
06:06:20.448 --> 06:06:20.458 align:start position:0%
recording that is often uh cost uh
 
06:06:22.970 --> 06:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
prohibitive so in other words could you
 
06:06:25.730 --> 06:06:25.740 align:start position:0%
download it onto a disk yes not a best
 
06:06:27.530 --> 06:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
case scenario because you want to have
 
06:06:29.770 --> 06:06:29.780 align:start position:0%
that encrypted in some way so that if
 
06:06:34.010 --> 06:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
that disk is left in some uh
 
06:06:36.830 --> 06:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
public area by accident that it is not
 
06:06:40.190 --> 06:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
accessible so there are again I'm not uh
 
06:06:41.570 --> 06:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
going to
 
06:06:44.570 --> 06:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
address the amount that was given in
 
06:06:46.970 --> 06:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
terms of the fiscal note on this but uh
 
06:06:48.890 --> 06:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
I would say that it is I think a little
 
06:06:51.470 --> 06:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
bit more involved than just downloading
 
06:06:54.110 --> 06:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
it uh there need to be specific uh there
 
06:06:56.448 --> 06:06:56.458 align:start position:0%
should be specific protocols uh in how
 
06:06:58.670 --> 06:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
you handle a recording once you have
 
06:07:00.770 --> 06:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
obtained it the other thing I wanted to
 
06:07:02.990 --> 06:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
address is just there has been a lot of
 
06:07:05.330 --> 06:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh questions over what what happens if a
 
06:07:07.850 --> 06:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
a defendant somebody you've arrested
 
06:07:10.610 --> 06:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
says I don't want you to record me we
 
06:07:12.470 --> 06:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
don't record them uh it would be my
 
06:07:13.670 --> 06:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of it is it would be a
 
06:07:15.490 --> 06:07:15.500 align:start position:0%
violation of the one party statute
 
06:07:19.190 --> 06:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
oftentimes that's uh a point of
 
06:07:20.990 --> 06:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
frustration for me I I would much rather
 
06:07:23.810 --> 06:07:23.820 align:start position:0%
have the ability to speak to somebody be
 
06:07:26.270 --> 06:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
able to look at them eye to eye not be
 
06:07:28.368 --> 06:07:28.378 align:start position:0%
taking notes and and to make sure that
 
06:07:29.930 --> 06:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
everything that is being said is being
 
06:07:31.850 --> 06:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
accurately captured
 
06:07:33.948 --> 06:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
um but that uh that is certainly their
 
06:07:36.170 --> 06:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
right if they say I don't want you to
 
06:07:39.230 --> 06:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
record me and oftentimes people will say
 
06:07:42.170 --> 06:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
to us I will not speak to you unless
 
06:07:44.390 --> 06:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
you're not recording me so in those
 
06:07:46.070 --> 06:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances I think that this
 
06:07:48.350 --> 06:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
particular bill would be problematic
 
06:07:50.270 --> 06:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
though I understand the intent of it I
 
06:07:51.830 --> 06:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring those things forward and
 
06:07:53.930 --> 06:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions that
 
06:07:56.868 --> 06:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:58.010 --> 06:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to take the first question
 
06:08:00.590 --> 06:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
for myself what does the State Police do
 
06:08:02.510 --> 06:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
currently what is your policy on
 
06:08:05.208 --> 06:08:05.218 align:start position:0%
custodial interrogations yeah custodial
 
06:08:07.250 --> 06:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
interrogations I heard some testimony
 
06:08:10.190 --> 06:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
previously but uh that was uh that's
 
06:08:11.810 --> 06:08:11.820 align:start position:0%
unknown to me if that is in fact the
 
06:08:13.788 --> 06:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
case that we require it however it is a
 
06:08:15.890 --> 06:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
best practice uh there is there's no
 
06:08:17.570 --> 06:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
doubt about it if uh if you're having a
 
06:08:19.670 --> 06:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
custodial interrogation and you have the
 
06:08:22.670 --> 06:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
means with which to record that that is
 
06:08:24.170 --> 06:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
absolutely the best practice and we
 
06:08:25.310 --> 06:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
encourage that
 
06:08:27.230 --> 06:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
what I would uh there was a great deal
 
06:08:28.670 --> 06:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
of and I don't want to rehash what has
 
06:08:30.410 --> 06:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
already been uh uh discussed but there
 
06:08:32.570 --> 06:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
was a great deal of discussion over when
 
06:08:34.850 --> 06:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
is somebody when is it a custodial
 
06:08:37.010 --> 06:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
interrogation I will tell you that uh
 
06:08:38.570 --> 06:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
over the eight years I spent in our
 
06:08:41.810 --> 06:08:41.820 align:start position:0%
major crime unit uh I did a number of
 
06:08:45.770 --> 06:08:45.780 align:start position:0%
interviews in uh places of uh the back
 
06:08:48.170 --> 06:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
seat of a vehicle uh on the side of the
 
06:08:51.590 --> 06:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
road in a rest area in a McDonald's uh
 
06:08:54.530 --> 06:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
there are any number of areas that uh
 
06:08:57.110 --> 06:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
you you may record somebody that are not
 
06:08:59.628 --> 06:08:59.638 align:start position:0%
a clean dry environment like this where
 
06:09:02.330 --> 06:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
a camera system may be employed uh so
 
06:09:05.510 --> 06:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah it uh it very much varies in terms
 
06:09:07.788 --> 06:09:07.798 align:start position:0%
of where you are and and I think that
 
06:09:09.650 --> 06:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
definition of a custodial interview is
 
06:09:12.170 --> 06:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
is incredibly important
 
06:09:14.930 --> 06:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
is it possible a custodial interrogation
 
06:09:18.708 --> 06:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
could happen for example on an OU IRS on
 
06:09:21.048 --> 06:09:21.058 align:start position:0%
the way back to the station
 
06:09:23.510 --> 06:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
by my interpretation yes uh yeah
 
06:09:25.310 --> 06:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely you certainly have them in
 
06:09:26.690 --> 06:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
custody they're they're not free to
 
06:09:27.770 --> 06:09:27.780 align:start position:0%
leave they're in the back seat of your
 
06:09:30.830 --> 06:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
car not only are they uh presumably
 
06:09:32.510 --> 06:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
they're in handcuffs as well as they're
 
06:09:34.010 --> 06:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
in a vehicle that they can't get out of
 
06:09:35.810 --> 06:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
so I would say that anything at that
 
06:09:38.930 --> 06:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
point uh aside from an excited utterance
 
06:09:41.150 --> 06:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
from the the back seat so to speak uh
 
06:09:44.230 --> 06:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
would be a custodial interview thank you
 
06:09:47.810 --> 06:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:50.090 --> 06:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
06:09:52.850 --> 06:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:53.570 --> 06:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
about because I was a little bit
 
06:09:54.470 --> 06:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
embarrassed that I didn't know the
 
06:09:55.910 --> 06:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
answer to this question
 
06:09:58.310 --> 06:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
and I apologize because I very well may
 
06:10:01.070 --> 06:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
be opening up a hunu can of worms is
 
06:10:04.010 --> 06:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
there a certain age that a person has to
 
06:10:05.868 --> 06:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
be recorded if they're being arrested as
 
06:10:11.208 --> 06:10:11.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:13.250 --> 06:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with any statute that
 
06:10:16.788 --> 06:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
requires uh although I'm I'm certain
 
06:10:18.770 --> 06:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
that he will not be happy I says maybe
 
06:10:21.230 --> 06:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
attorney Halverson could speak to that
 
06:10:24.830 --> 06:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
more eloquently but I'm not aware of any
 
06:10:27.350 --> 06:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
statute there is Benoit warnings that
 
06:10:28.910 --> 06:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
are required when you're going to
 
06:10:31.070 --> 06:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
interview a juvenile and you read that
 
06:10:33.110 --> 06:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh the warnings to that Juvenile and
 
06:10:34.850 --> 06:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
there are lots and lots of caveats that
 
06:10:37.548 --> 06:10:37.558 align:start position:0%
go along with that but I'm not aware or
 
06:10:40.850 --> 06:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
I don't recall any specific
 
06:10:43.730 --> 06:10:43.740 align:start position:0%
legislative statute that says you have
 
06:10:47.990 --> 06:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:52.788 --> 06:10:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:56.030 --> 06:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
this is just a curiosity what does your
 
06:11:00.530 --> 06:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
department do with recordings
 
06:11:03.470 --> 06:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
so it really depends on the uh because
 
06:11:04.788 --> 06:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
we have
 
06:11:06.770 --> 06:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire we are a
 
06:11:09.470 --> 06:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
larger Department uh
 
06:11:11.868 --> 06:11:11.878 align:start position:0%
we have strict protocols on how things
 
06:11:14.048 --> 06:11:14.058 align:start position:0%
will be maintained
 
06:11:16.430 --> 06:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
however they may be slightly different
 
06:11:18.170 --> 06:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
based on whether or not you're assigned
 
06:11:20.690 --> 06:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
to a unit that uh is at headquarters or
 
06:11:23.270 --> 06:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
a unit that is at a local Barracks but
 
06:11:26.448 --> 06:11:26.458 align:start position:0%
typically now with our new uh RMS system
 
06:11:29.330 --> 06:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
that recording is attached within the
 
06:11:33.070 --> 06:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
RMS system there is a separate
 
06:11:36.470 --> 06:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
there is a separate mode or nodule to
 
06:11:39.110 --> 06:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
that uh to that system that is going to
 
06:11:41.510 --> 06:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
deal with evidence digital evidence that
 
06:11:43.730 --> 06:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
has not been activated yet so what we
 
06:11:45.830 --> 06:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
will typically require is we will
 
06:11:47.868 --> 06:11:47.878 align:start position:0%
require that that recording be made and
 
06:11:50.750 --> 06:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
be put on an encrypted thumb drive and
 
06:11:53.510 --> 06:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
be transported via that encrypted thumb
 
06:11:55.490 --> 06:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
drive you try to have a triple
 
06:11:57.170 --> 06:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
redundancy so you have it on your
 
06:11:59.390 --> 06:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
recorder you have it on the thumb drive
 
06:12:01.270 --> 06:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
and then you have it on a hard drive
 
06:12:03.410 --> 06:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
that is assigned to an individual
 
06:12:04.850 --> 06:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
Trooper so you have those three
 
06:12:06.948 --> 06:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
locations should anything happen to that
 
06:12:09.770 --> 06:12:09.780 align:start position:0%
specific piece of evidence but I think
 
06:12:12.170 --> 06:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
what's important to note is we
 
06:12:14.868 --> 06:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
acknowledge just what I was speaking to
 
06:12:16.430 --> 06:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative Royer to the committee
 
06:12:18.650 --> 06:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
about previously which is a best case
 
06:12:21.288 --> 06:12:21.298 align:start position:0%
scenario is that you uh you you have
 
06:12:23.150 --> 06:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
that in a digital format behind lots and
 
06:12:25.070 --> 06:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
lots of firewalls
 
06:12:28.010 --> 06:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:30.110 --> 06:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
representative Platt thank you Mr
 
06:12:31.490 --> 06:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you thank you for taking
 
06:12:33.530 --> 06:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
my question you used an ackerman's
 
06:12:35.090 --> 06:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
acronym so I just want to make sure I
 
06:12:37.070 --> 06:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
understand it rms's records management
 
06:12:46.850 --> 06:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:48.590 --> 06:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
see enough further questions thank you
 
06:12:58.128 --> 06:12:58.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:04.010 --> 06:13:04.020 align:start position:0%

we are we are more than willing on the
 
06:13:08.150 --> 06:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
issue of somebody who doesn't want to be
 
06:13:10.490 --> 06:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
recorded we are more than willing to
 
06:13:12.530 --> 06:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
write up an exception for the committee
 
06:13:14.510 --> 06:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
in that circumstance those are not
 
06:13:16.310 --> 06:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
uncommon exceptions around the country
 
06:13:18.830 --> 06:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
in states that require recordings of
 
06:13:20.448 --> 06:13:20.458 align:start position:0%
confessions and we're more than willing
 
06:13:22.430 --> 06:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
06:13:23.990 --> 06:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for that we'll take that into
 
06:13:24.000 --> 06:13:25.610 align:start position:0%
thank you for that we'll take that into
consideration

06:13:25.610 --> 06:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
06:13:28.310 --> 06:13:28.320 align:start position:0%

this bill
 
06:14:46.970 --> 06:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
this has to do with
 
06:14:49.970 --> 06:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
the right to know and body cameras
 
06:14:51.470 --> 06:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
there's a situation in the city of
 
06:14:54.288 --> 06:14:54.298 align:start position:0%
Manchester or an individual
 
06:14:54.298 --> 06:14:55.128 align:start position:0%
Manchester or an individual
um

06:14:55.128 --> 06:14:55.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:56.810 --> 06:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
had a
 
06:15:05.628 --> 06:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:07.910 --> 06:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
someone please silence their ice cream
 
06:15:07.920 --> 06:15:10.430 align:start position:0%
someone please silence their ice cream
truck

06:15:10.430 --> 06:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:12.650 --> 06:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:15:14.330 --> 06:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
let's continue individual had an
 
06:15:16.670 --> 06:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
interaction with the city employee
 
06:15:19.910 --> 06:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
and that individual went to the
 
06:15:21.590 --> 06:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester Police Department
 
06:15:26.690 --> 06:15:26.700 align:start position:0%
and had an interview in a police report
 
06:15:28.548 --> 06:15:28.558 align:start position:0%
was submitted and there were a number of
 
06:15:31.610 --> 06:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
inaccuracies to the individual
 
06:15:31.620 --> 06:15:33.288 align:start position:0%
inaccuracies to the individual
statements

06:15:33.288 --> 06:15:33.298 align:start position:0%
statements
 
06:15:37.310 --> 06:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:37.320 --> 06:15:38.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:15:38.270 --> 06:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:41.930 --> 06:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
was obtained that showed some of the
 
06:15:44.890 --> 06:15:44.900 align:start position:0%
items that were presented to the police
 
06:15:48.770 --> 06:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
and state it occurred did not occur
 
06:15:50.690 --> 06:15:50.700 align:start position:0%
so the individual was accused of doing
 
06:15:52.490 --> 06:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
this requested a copy of the interview
 
06:15:54.410 --> 06:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
from the city of Manchester Police
 
06:15:54.420 --> 06:15:55.850 align:start position:0%
from the city of Manchester Police
Department

06:15:55.850 --> 06:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
Department
 
06:15:58.310 --> 06:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
they said the interview was done by Body
 
06:15:58.320 --> 06:15:59.448 align:start position:0%
they said the interview was done by Body
camera

06:15:59.448 --> 06:15:59.458 align:start position:0%
camera
 
06:16:02.090 --> 06:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
so it is not
 
06:16:04.788 --> 06:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
um open to the
 
06:16:06.948 --> 06:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
right to know law
 
06:16:09.830 --> 06:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
so I immediately read the law
 
06:16:11.208 --> 06:16:11.218 align:start position:0%
and then got in the phone with the
 
06:16:12.830 --> 06:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
honorable Neil Kirk
 
06:16:15.708 --> 06:16:15.718 align:start position:0%
former uh representative and said is
 
06:16:17.690 --> 06:16:17.700 align:start position:0%
this what you intended this to be
 
06:16:20.628 --> 06:16:20.638 align:start position:0%
did you intend that that interviews
 
06:16:22.368 --> 06:16:22.378 align:start position:0%
through body cameras
 
06:16:26.270 --> 06:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
be not subject to 91a
 
06:16:28.970 --> 06:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
so when I submitted the piece of
 
06:16:31.310 --> 06:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
legislation again we all know what it
 
06:16:32.868 --> 06:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
was like last year we had a week to put
 
06:16:34.190 --> 06:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
bills together
 
06:16:36.230 --> 06:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
and the initial bill
 
06:16:36.240 --> 06:16:37.128 align:start position:0%
and the initial bill
um

06:16:37.128 --> 06:16:37.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:41.150 --> 06:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
is presented in front of you here 1600.
 
06:16:43.010 --> 06:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
the the point
 
06:16:44.750 --> 06:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
06:16:44.760 --> 06:16:47.208 align:start position:0%
at the time
was

06:16:47.208 --> 06:16:47.218 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:16:49.070 --> 06:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
as I find it
 
06:16:56.510 --> 06:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:59.330 --> 06:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
make it so if you did not have
 
06:17:02.208 --> 06:17:02.218 align:start position:0%
you well okay I need to back up I
 
06:17:04.430 --> 06:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
apologize so when another individual
 
06:17:06.948 --> 06:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
questioned the chief of police in the
 
06:17:08.570 --> 06:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester who I have great
 
06:17:12.350 --> 06:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
respect for and who I I personally like
 
06:17:16.128 --> 06:17:16.138 align:start position:0%
why did you utilize body cameras when
 
06:17:17.990 --> 06:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
you have interrogation rooms with audio
 
06:17:19.070 --> 06:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
and video
 
06:17:21.470 --> 06:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
well that's upstairs and sometimes on
 
06:17:23.390 --> 06:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
smaller type cases we don't bring people
 
06:17:25.490 --> 06:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
upstairs we have them downstairs and
 
06:17:27.890 --> 06:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
there's no audio or video downstairs so
 
06:17:31.548 --> 06:17:31.558 align:start position:0%
we utilized the body cameras and so it
 
06:17:33.048 --> 06:17:33.058 align:start position:0%
just so happens we utilize the body
 
06:17:34.970 --> 06:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
cameras and the law says we don't have
 
06:17:36.650 --> 06:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
to give it to you so
 
06:17:38.628 --> 06:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
the question here is
 
06:17:42.410 --> 06:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of you talks about
 
06:17:44.510 --> 06:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
um that they can body cameras cannot be
 
06:17:47.208 --> 06:17:47.218 align:start position:0%
used for interviews unless they uh don't
 
06:17:49.490 --> 06:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
have any other facilities and I've said
 
06:17:53.570 --> 06:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
I've given to you two parts of the RSA
 
06:17:59.030 --> 06:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
chapter uh 105 D which outlines
 
06:17:59.040 --> 06:18:02.150 align:start position:0%
chapter uh 105 D which outlines
um

06:18:02.150 --> 06:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:04.190 --> 06:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
where this bill says this should go it
 
06:18:06.530 --> 06:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
adds another
 
06:18:09.048 --> 06:18:09.058 align:start position:0%
letter right now it's a through H it
 
06:18:12.110 --> 06:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:15.410 --> 06:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
stating that they cannot use body
 
06:18:17.570 --> 06:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
cameras or interrogations unless they
 
06:18:19.548 --> 06:18:19.558 align:start position:0%
don't have any other facility but the
 
06:18:21.410 --> 06:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
more I think about this the more I think
 
06:18:24.048 --> 06:18:24.058 align:start position:0%
this really needs to be revised under
 
06:18:27.048 --> 06:18:27.058 align:start position:0%
section 9185
 
06:18:28.730 --> 06:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
item 10.
 
06:18:30.948 --> 06:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
which is the one piece of paper that
 
06:18:34.070 --> 06:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
I've sent to you which outlines
 
06:18:34.080 --> 06:18:34.970 align:start position:0%
I've sent to you which outlines
um

06:18:34.970 --> 06:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:38.868 --> 06:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
that audio and video recordings
 
06:18:42.708 --> 06:18:42.718 align:start position:0%
body cameras really can not be utilized
 
06:18:45.350 --> 06:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
or accessed under 91a except for some
 
06:18:47.570 --> 06:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
conditions a b and c
 
06:18:49.128 --> 06:18:49.138 align:start position:0%
that's really where I believe this
 
06:18:51.230 --> 06:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
belongs as the chief of police stated I
 
06:18:52.430 --> 06:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
believe in this
 
06:18:54.350 --> 06:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
committee last year transparency
 
06:18:56.750 --> 06:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
transparency transparency those were his
 
06:18:56.760 --> 06:18:58.430 align:start position:0%
transparency transparency those were his
quotes

06:18:58.430 --> 06:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
quotes
 
06:19:00.410 --> 06:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
um and I agree with that
 
06:19:03.350 --> 06:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
and whether this was a simple
 
06:19:03.360 --> 06:19:05.288 align:start position:0%
and whether this was a simple
honest

06:19:05.288 --> 06:19:05.298 align:start position:0%
honest
 
06:19:07.910 --> 06:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
situation where the law is what it is or
 
06:19:10.910 --> 06:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
whether this was done on purpose
 
06:19:13.330 --> 06:19:13.340 align:start position:0%
to keep that that interview
 
06:19:17.030 --> 06:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
not subject to review I don't know
 
06:19:18.410 --> 06:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
I don't care
 
06:19:20.150 --> 06:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
I don't care to go back and rehash
 
06:19:22.310 --> 06:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
issues the question is
 
06:19:24.010 --> 06:19:24.020 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
06:19:27.708 --> 06:19:27.718 align:start position:0%
interviews done with body cameras are
 
06:19:29.570 --> 06:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
subject to 91a or not and whether this
 
06:19:30.708 --> 06:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
committee feels they should be or
 
06:19:32.650 --> 06:19:32.660 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
06:19:35.030 --> 06:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
obviously when I spoke to representative
 
06:19:38.810 --> 06:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
in Kirk about this you know the goal of
 
06:19:40.910 --> 06:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
of the law was to make it so someone who
 
06:19:42.970 --> 06:19:42.980 align:start position:0%
may be being the periphery
 
06:19:45.230 --> 06:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
police are out on the scene there's all
 
06:19:47.570 --> 06:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
kinds of stuff going on uh certain
 
06:19:47.580 --> 06:19:48.890 align:start position:0%
kinds of stuff going on uh certain
things

06:19:48.890 --> 06:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:19:48.900 --> 06:19:49.850 align:start position:0%
things
um

06:19:49.850 --> 06:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:52.730 --> 06:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
if you and I happen to be
 
06:19:55.330 --> 06:19:55.340 align:start position:0%
in the same area do we really want our
 
06:19:57.708 --> 06:19:57.718 align:start position:0%
likeness and presented to the public of
 
06:20:00.230 --> 06:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
maybe we were in a place where we didn't
 
06:20:01.788 --> 06:20:01.798 align:start position:0%
want people to know we were in a certain
 
06:20:01.798 --> 06:20:02.750 align:start position:0%
want people to know we were in a certain
place

06:20:02.750 --> 06:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:20:04.250 --> 06:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what the point was
 
06:20:07.250 --> 06:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure the point was to allow
 
06:20:10.970 --> 06:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:15.350 --> 06:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
to be utilized to utilize body cams and
 
06:20:17.150 --> 06:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
then you could say sorry
 
06:20:19.730 --> 06:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
not subject to naughty one day and I'm
 
06:20:22.070 --> 06:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
not sure that is the intended it's sure
 
06:20:23.570 --> 06:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
it's something I don't believe it should
 
06:20:25.970 --> 06:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
be the intent so while my bill talks
 
06:20:25.980 --> 06:20:26.750 align:start position:0%
be the intent so while my bill talks
about

06:20:26.750 --> 06:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:20:29.868 --> 06:20:29.878 align:start position:0%
eliminating the ability to utilize body
 
06:20:33.590 --> 06:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:37.430 --> 06:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
I would like the ability to amend my
 
06:20:41.390 --> 06:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
legislation to really make it um
 
06:20:46.010 --> 06:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:49.490 --> 06:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
91 A5 under the exemptions 10 and adding
 
06:20:49.500 --> 06:20:51.470 align:start position:0%
91 A5 under the exemptions 10 and adding
another

06:20:51.470 --> 06:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
another
 
06:20:53.150 --> 06:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
um area another
 
06:20:55.610 --> 06:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
there's a b and c adding d
 
06:20:57.890 --> 06:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
to allow for this to be covered under
 
06:21:01.128 --> 06:21:01.138 align:start position:0%
the 91a if the body cams are used
 
06:21:03.170 --> 06:21:03.180 align:start position:0%
for interior for interviews and
 
06:21:03.180 --> 06:21:07.788 align:start position:0%
for interior for interviews and
interrogations

06:21:07.788 --> 06:21:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:10.070 --> 06:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's all Mr chairman
 
06:21:15.708 --> 06:21:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:22.070 --> 06:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:25.250 --> 06:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:27.650 --> 06:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
this time the chair recognizes Captain
 
06:21:36.470 --> 06:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:38.510 --> 06:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone
 
06:21:40.670 --> 06:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
again for the purpose of the record my
 
06:21:43.310 --> 06:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
name is Joe Ebert e-b-e-r-t and I am a
 
06:21:45.230 --> 06:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
captain with the state police overseeing
 
06:21:47.708 --> 06:21:47.718 align:start position:0%
the Investigative Services Bureau
 
06:21:47.718 --> 06:21:49.368 align:start position:0%
the Investigative Services Bureau
uh

06:21:49.368 --> 06:21:49.378 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:21:52.610 --> 06:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to this bill uh for a
 
06:21:54.708 --> 06:21:54.718 align:start position:0%
couple of different reasons the first is
 
06:21:57.230 --> 06:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
as you may remember from some testimony
 
06:21:59.330 --> 06:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
that I gave a couple minutes ago the
 
06:22:01.250 --> 06:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
state police has the occasion to be
 
06:22:03.708 --> 06:22:03.718 align:start position:0%
throughout the entirety of the State uh
 
06:22:05.990 --> 06:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
we are oftentimes in small police
 
06:22:09.470 --> 06:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
departments and in very rural areas that
 
06:22:11.930 --> 06:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
don't have recording mechanisms our
 
06:22:14.330 --> 06:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
thought was that we would utilize that
 
06:22:17.628 --> 06:22:17.638 align:start position:0%
uh that body camera to do just what we
 
06:22:19.670 --> 06:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh what I discussed previously but I
 
06:22:20.990 --> 06:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
would say again for the purpose of the
 
06:22:23.330 --> 06:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
record in this bill which is uh in a
 
06:22:25.730 --> 06:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
best case scenario you record both the
 
06:22:28.270 --> 06:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
audio and the video of that interview
 
06:22:31.548 --> 06:22:31.558 align:start position:0%
and what I would suggest to you is we
 
06:22:33.590 --> 06:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
are outfitting each one of our Troopers
 
06:22:36.288 --> 06:22:36.298 align:start position:0%
with a body camera and we were looking
 
06:22:38.390 --> 06:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
at that as being a feasible means with
 
06:22:40.910 --> 06:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
which to record uh interviews and
 
06:22:44.030 --> 06:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
interrogations so on its base we would
 
06:22:45.530 --> 06:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
say uh
 
06:22:47.810 --> 06:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
we would like to utilize the body camera
 
06:22:49.910 --> 06:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
the body worn camera for for that
 
06:22:49.920 --> 06:22:52.128 align:start position:0%
the body worn camera for for that
purpose

06:22:52.128 --> 06:22:52.138 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
06:22:55.368 --> 06:22:55.378 align:start position:0%
um I I also wanted to just address uh I
 
06:22:57.770 --> 06:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what the uh the
 
06:22:58.910 --> 06:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative who put the bill forward
 
06:23:01.730 --> 06:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
what his issue uh was
 
06:23:03.890 --> 06:23:03.900 align:start position:0%
um but I at least put forward for the
 
06:23:06.170 --> 06:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
consumption of the committee the notion
 
06:23:09.288 --> 06:23:09.298 align:start position:0%
that uh it seems as though a discovery
 
06:23:11.628 --> 06:23:11.638 align:start position:0%
request in a criminal proceeding would
 
06:23:14.868 --> 06:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
supersede the uh the 91a exemption so in
 
06:23:17.150 --> 06:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
other words uh if you were
 
06:23:18.948 --> 06:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
um you know if you had obtained this
 
06:23:21.410 --> 06:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
this body worn footage and you have this
 
06:23:23.448 --> 06:23:23.458 align:start position:0%
but it uh somebody is challenging the
 
06:23:27.470 --> 06:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
validity of an arrest you would uh
 
06:23:29.150 --> 06:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
under rules of Discovery you would need
 
06:23:31.730 --> 06:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
to provide that recording regardless of
 
06:23:34.970 --> 06:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
uh the exclusion under the 91a statute
 
06:23:37.070 --> 06:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
again that's that's my interpretation of
 
06:23:39.230 --> 06:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
that but I for the purpose of this
 
06:23:40.610 --> 06:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
committee I at least wanted to put that
 
06:23:42.170 --> 06:23:42.180 align:start position:0%
out for consumption
 
06:23:44.150 --> 06:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
having said that those are all my
 
06:23:45.288 --> 06:23:45.298 align:start position:0%
statements I'm happy to answer any
 
06:23:45.298 --> 06:23:47.750 align:start position:0%
statements I'm happy to answer any
questions

06:23:47.750 --> 06:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:50.690 --> 06:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
thank you the witness is excused thank
 
06:23:50.700 --> 06:23:54.288 align:start position:0%
thank you the witness is excused thank
you

06:23:54.288 --> 06:23:54.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:07.430 --> 06:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:09.530 --> 06:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
good afternoon representative and the
 
06:24:11.448 --> 06:24:11.458 align:start position:0%
committee members and thank you for
 
06:24:13.910 --> 06:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
having me here Dan Conley captain of the
 
06:24:15.590 --> 06:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
Goffstown Police Department
 
06:24:18.110 --> 06:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today on behalf of the New
 
06:24:19.548 --> 06:24:19.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association and Chiefs of
 
06:24:19.558 --> 06:24:20.690 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association and Chiefs of
police

06:24:20.690 --> 06:24:20.700 align:start position:0%
police
 
06:24:24.770 --> 06:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
uh we oppose this house bill 1600
 
06:24:26.330 --> 06:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
um you know in every other occurrence
 
06:24:28.730 --> 06:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
including the most severe use of deadly
 
06:24:32.208 --> 06:24:32.218 align:start position:0%
force RSA 105 D2 is a trusted means to
 
06:24:35.330 --> 06:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
record police encounters with citizens
 
06:24:38.570 --> 06:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
um this bill would say that that is not
 
06:24:41.448 --> 06:24:41.458 align:start position:0%
um a good enough record of a custody
 
06:24:41.458 --> 06:24:42.410 align:start position:0%
um a good enough record of a custody
interview

06:24:42.410 --> 06:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
interview
 
06:24:44.150 --> 06:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
I would agree that the body won't camera
 
06:24:46.128 --> 06:24:46.138 align:start position:0%
is a more secure means the data
 
06:24:47.628 --> 06:24:47.638 align:start position:0%
retention as there is and has been
 
06:24:49.670 --> 06:24:49.680 align:start position:0%

06:26:05.750 --> 06:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
by administrator administrator access is
 
06:26:07.910 --> 06:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
held in our department with the rank of
 
06:26:09.470 --> 06:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
Sergeant or above
 
06:26:11.690 --> 06:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
any changes to a particular video or
 
06:26:13.548 --> 06:26:13.558 align:start position:0%
setting within the software are recorded
 
06:26:16.430 --> 06:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
to show who made the change and when
 
06:26:19.128 --> 06:26:19.138 align:start position:0%
basic access is given to every officer
 
06:26:21.530 --> 06:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
and they have they are not able to make
 
06:26:25.190 --> 06:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
any edits or changes to the videos
 
06:26:27.230 --> 06:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
I would argue that body One camera is
 
06:26:29.030 --> 06:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
more secure and more guaranteed method
 
06:26:31.910 --> 06:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
of recording and retention
 
06:26:35.510 --> 06:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
and as Captain Ebert said
 
06:26:37.670 --> 06:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's handy it's on us
 
06:26:39.288 --> 06:26:39.298 align:start position:0%
when I was talking
 
06:26:40.850 --> 06:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
um earlier about where these interviews
 
06:26:42.590 --> 06:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
take place you know in the police Lobby
 
06:26:44.750 --> 06:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
sally port roadside the body worn camera
 
06:26:46.128 --> 06:26:46.138 align:start position:0%
in our Department's always with our
 
06:26:46.138 --> 06:26:47.930 align:start position:0%

06:27:11.868 --> 06:27:11.878 align:start position:0%
and for the last witness we have Paul
 
06:27:11.878 --> 06:27:16.610 align:start position:0%
and for the last witness we have Paul
and

06:27:16.610 --> 06:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:17.990 --> 06:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
both myself in the court were having
 
06:27:20.270 --> 06:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
difficulty reading the writing today
 
06:27:22.128 --> 06:27:22.138 align:start position:0%
probably my writing
 
06:27:25.548 --> 06:27:25.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:27.770 --> 06:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Paul Halverson
 
06:27:30.770 --> 06:27:30.780 align:start position:0%
I'm the Merrimack County attorney and
 
06:27:32.750 --> 06:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
um I spoke with several County attorneys
 
06:27:36.490 --> 06:27:36.500 align:start position:0%
about House Bill 1600 as it's introduced
 
06:27:40.910 --> 06:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
and we do not uh support this bill as
 
06:27:43.010 --> 06:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
it's introduced
 
06:27:45.048 --> 06:27:45.058 align:start position:0%
some of the things that we're concerned
 
06:27:47.628 --> 06:27:47.638 align:start position:0%
about with this is that
 
06:27:50.110 --> 06:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
body warrant camera statute
 
06:27:54.170 --> 06:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
105 D2 talks about use of body-worn
 
06:27:54.180 --> 06:27:55.430 align:start position:0%
105 D2 talks about use of body-worn
cameras

06:27:55.430 --> 06:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
06:27:59.270 --> 06:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
and the intent of the overall intent 105
 
06:28:03.410 --> 06:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
D2 is to have a record of interactions
 
06:28:05.330 --> 06:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
between the police officers and
 
06:28:08.810 --> 06:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
individuals and to exempt the use of
 
06:28:12.770 --> 06:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
body war on camera if the prior bill is
 
06:28:16.850 --> 06:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
is passed frankly it doesn't make any
 
06:28:18.530 --> 06:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
sense a recording is a recording no
 
06:28:19.970 --> 06:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
matter what the methodology is whether
 
06:28:23.330 --> 06:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
it's a body-worn camera or or otherwise
 
06:28:24.948 --> 06:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
and to prohibit the use of a body
 
06:28:28.910 --> 06:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
warrant camera would uh would would be
 
06:28:30.830 --> 06:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
in opposition of the intent of the prior
 
06:28:34.610 --> 06:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:34.620 --> 06:28:36.048 align:start position:0%
 
introduced

06:28:36.048 --> 06:28:36.058 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
06:28:39.708 --> 06:28:39.718 align:start position:0%
a proposed stat statute a couple things
 
06:28:41.448 --> 06:28:41.458 align:start position:0%
that I would comment about
 
06:28:43.788 --> 06:28:43.798 align:start position:0%
in relationship between this and the
 
06:28:46.010 --> 06:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
prior the prior issue that that the
 
06:28:48.128 --> 06:28:48.138 align:start position:0%
committee is is considering
 
06:28:50.448 --> 06:28:50.458 align:start position:0%
it's interesting within the body worn
 
06:28:52.670 --> 06:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
camera statute that the statute
 
06:28:55.610 --> 06:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
addresses to be used only while on while
 
06:28:57.890 --> 06:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
in uniform that's contained within
 
06:29:00.650 --> 06:29:00.660 align:start position:0%
paragraph Roman 4 within the body worn
 
06:29:03.430 --> 06:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
camera stat statute
 
06:29:05.868 --> 06:29:05.878 align:start position:0%
there's an argument to be made that a
 
06:29:10.490 --> 06:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
plain clothes officer is in uniform for
 
06:29:11.708 --> 06:29:11.718 align:start position:0%
a department
 
06:29:16.430 --> 06:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
however a a body more on camera used by
 
06:29:19.730 --> 06:29:19.740 align:start position:0%
a plain clothes officer in recording a
 
06:29:19.740 --> 06:29:20.770 align:start position:0%
a plain clothes officer in recording a
statement

06:29:20.770 --> 06:29:20.780 align:start position:0%
statement
 
06:29:24.230 --> 06:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
if it was allowed within a police
 
06:29:24.240 --> 06:29:25.430 align:start position:0%
if it was allowed within a police
department

06:29:25.430 --> 06:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:29:28.610 --> 06:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
would if a court said a uniform is a
 
06:29:30.530 --> 06:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
uniform and not plain clothes
 
06:29:34.070 --> 06:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
would have to be destroyed by by Statute
 
06:29:35.930 --> 06:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
even if it contained exculpatory
 
06:29:35.940 --> 06:29:36.948 align:start position:0%
even if it contained exculpatory
information

06:29:36.948 --> 06:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:29:39.070 --> 06:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
I would refer you to
 
06:29:46.128 --> 06:29:46.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:49.788 --> 06:29:49.798 align:start position:0%
Romans 18 if you don't comply with the
 
06:29:52.270 --> 06:29:52.280 align:start position:0%
statute you have to to destroy the video
 
06:29:55.910 --> 06:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
even if it's exculpatory and frankly we
 
06:29:58.730 --> 06:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
we see that as a as a weak point in 105
 
06:30:01.150 --> 06:30:01.160 align:start position:0%
d d D2
 
06:30:04.910 --> 06:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
overall though uh the uh you the
 
06:30:07.490 --> 06:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
prohibition of using a body camera to
 
06:30:11.150 --> 06:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
record a a Miranda custodian
 
06:30:14.448 --> 06:30:14.458 align:start position:0%
interrogation makes sense and frankly
 
06:30:16.250 --> 06:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
it's more cost effective than trying to
 
06:30:18.830 --> 06:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
install cameras throughout throughout
 
06:30:18.840 --> 06:30:20.570 align:start position:0%

correct a typographical error ill
 
06:35:13.430 --> 06:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately the first amendment
 
06:35:16.310 --> 06:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
that I had drafted was also wrong so
 
06:35:18.948 --> 06:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
this is a second attempt this time we
 
06:35:21.530 --> 06:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:23.570 --> 06:35:23.580 align:start position:0%

06:35:26.570 --> 06:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
it corrects
 
06:35:26.580 --> 06:35:31.128 align:start position:0%

first line 29 on page 10.
 
06:35:40.250 --> 06:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
and it replaces Roman numeral eight
 
06:35:43.490 --> 06:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
with Roman numeral five on four on line
 
06:35:51.470 --> 06:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:54.288 --> 06:35:54.298 align:start position:0%

attorneys that were here to testify on
 
06:35:58.850 --> 06:35:58.860 align:start position:0%

correct

06:36:07.868 --> 06:36:07.878 align:start position:0%

I have a question
 
06:39:54.948 --> 06:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
it was her Amendment before us uh
 
06:39:59.708 --> 06:39:59.718 align:start position:0%

06:40:02.208 --> 06:40:02.218 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm looking for it here but
 
06:40:05.030 --> 06:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
some point John Skipper regarding uh
 
06:40:07.250 --> 06:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
duplicative language uh there's been to
 
06:40:08.930 --> 06:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
be struck
 
06:40:10.730 --> 06:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that this
 
06:40:12.948 --> 06:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
amendment addressed the exact issue that
 
06:40:15.890 --> 06:40:15.900 align:start position:0%

speak
 
06:43:39.590 --> 06:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
to them just briefly I think
 
06:43:41.270 --> 06:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
I think Bill is
 
06:43:41.280 --> 06:43:43.128 align:start position:0%
I think Bill is
premature

06:43:43.128 --> 06:43:43.138 align:start position:0%
premature
 
06:43:46.128 --> 06:43:46.138 align:start position:0%
mature I think that encryption adds
 
06:43:49.850 --> 06:43:49.860 align:start position:0%
complexity to Communications in an area
 
06:43:54.490 --> 06:43:54.500 align:start position:0%
that serves more than one
 
06:43:57.890 --> 06:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
municipality including fire and Eminence
 
06:43:59.390 --> 06:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
and police
 
06:44:04.670 --> 06:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
and in situations where you are uh have
 
06:44:07.190 --> 06:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
to make Split Second decisions being
 
06:44:09.350 --> 06:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
able to go back and forth between two
 
06:44:12.350 --> 06:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
different channels it adds even more
 
06:44:14.810 --> 06:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
complexity I don't think we're ready for
 
06:44:15.890 --> 06:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
this yet
 
06:44:20.570 --> 06:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:23.150 --> 06:44:23.160 align:start position:0%

06:44:27.650 --> 06:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:30.230 --> 06:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative Burt you were recognized
 
06:44:32.868 --> 06:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:44:37.128 --> 06:44:37.138 align:start position:0%
I will be vote voting against the itl
 
06:44:39.490 --> 06:44:39.500 align:start position:0%
I think there's issues with this bill
 
06:44:43.490 --> 06:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
but there is a possibility of making it
 
06:44:43.500 --> 06:44:44.628 align:start position:0%
but there is a possibility of making it
work

06:44:44.628 --> 06:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
work
 
06:44:54.530 --> 06:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:02.090 --> 06:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:02.100 --> 06:45:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:45:05.270 --> 06:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:10.128 --> 06:45:10.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:12.650 --> 06:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
I think in testimony I heard that there
 
06:45:15.770 --> 06:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
was a problem between the two two
 
06:45:15.780 --> 06:45:16.850 align:start position:0%
was a problem between the two two
different

06:45:16.850 --> 06:45:16.860 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:45:20.150 --> 06:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
groups of law and the federal government
 
06:45:24.048 --> 06:45:24.058 align:start position:0%
when you have this encryption and
 
06:45:26.750 --> 06:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
furthermore they hear that some towns
 
06:45:28.970 --> 06:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
don't have it at all and some have
 
06:45:28.980 --> 06:45:30.048 align:start position:0%
don't have it at all and some have
partial

06:45:30.048 --> 06:45:30.058 align:start position:0%
partial
 
06:45:32.750 --> 06:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
but then there are at least one town
 
06:45:35.810 --> 06:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
where it's completely encrypted I do
 
06:45:37.670 --> 06:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that
 
06:45:41.990 --> 06:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:43.970 --> 06:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
I would just point out that the bill is
 
06:45:45.350 --> 06:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
drafted as presented to the committee
 
06:45:46.670 --> 06:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely no consequence
 
06:45:48.830 --> 06:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's complied with or not and
 
06:45:50.270 --> 06:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
the bill is just not ready for prime
 
06:45:52.490 --> 06:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
time I think that the subject the
 
06:45:55.310 --> 06:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
subject is worthy but I think with that
 
06:45:58.190 --> 06:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
being said and we have a public hearing
 
06:45:59.690 --> 06:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to start soon I think we
 
06:45:59.700 --> 06:46:00.890 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to start soon I think we
can

06:46:00.890 --> 06:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:46:03.410 --> 06:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
although representative Eric to respond
 
06:46:06.368 --> 06:46:06.378 align:start position:0%
to that my comment
 
06:46:10.610 --> 06:46:10.620 align:start position:0%
able to change the motion to um to a
 
06:46:18.350 --> 06:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:24.890 --> 06:46:24.900 align:start position:0%

06:46:32.150 --> 06:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps we'll explore the idea of a
 
06:46:33.890 --> 06:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
study committee after we move the
 
06:46:36.890 --> 06:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
question on and experience allegedly
 
06:46:38.448 --> 06:46:38.458 align:start position:0%
at this time the matter will now be put
 
06:46:40.548 --> 06:46:40.558 align:start position:0%
the question if you in support of the
 
06:46:42.288 --> 06:46:42.298 align:start position:0%
motion of index being to legislate
 
06:46:45.048 --> 06:46:45.058 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair
 
06:50:49.490 --> 06:50:49.500 align:start position:0%

Mr chair thank you for this opportunity
 
06:51:05.868 --> 06:51:05.878 align:start position:0%
to introduce House Bill 1483 relative to
 
06:51:08.448 --> 06:51:08.458 align:start position:0%
the use of physical Force by a law
 
06:51:10.430 --> 06:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer
 
06:51:12.350 --> 06:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps some members of this committee
 
06:51:14.628 --> 06:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
will have a slight feeling of deja vu
 
06:51:17.448 --> 06:51:17.458 align:start position:0%
upon hearing my testimony
 
06:51:19.788 --> 06:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
Hospital 1483
 
06:51:22.128 --> 06:51:22.138 align:start position:0%
is concerned with the criminal code
 
06:51:25.788 --> 06:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
the general rule of Isa 627 colon 1
 
06:51:25.798 --> 06:51:26.990 align:start position:0%
the general rule of Isa 627 colon 1
States

06:51:26.990 --> 06:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
States
 
06:51:29.690 --> 06:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
conduct which is justifiable under this
 
06:51:29.700 --> 06:51:30.948 align:start position:0%
conduct which is justifiable under this
chapter

06:51:30.948 --> 06:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
06:51:34.670 --> 06:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
constitutes a defense to any offense
 
06:51:37.150 --> 06:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that such conduct is Justified
 
06:51:40.490 --> 06:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
shall constitute a complete defense
 
06:51:42.650 --> 06:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
to any civil action based on such
 
06:51:42.660 --> 06:51:44.690 align:start position:0%
to any civil action based on such
conduct

06:51:44.690 --> 06:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
06:51:49.190 --> 06:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1483 amends Isa 627 colon 5.
 
06:51:51.170 --> 06:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2.
 
06:51:54.288 --> 06:51:54.298 align:start position:0%
by removing the justification by using
 
06:51:58.670 --> 06:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
deadly force to affect an arrest
 
06:52:00.230 --> 06:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
06:52:03.468 --> 06:52:03.478 align:start position:0%
if House Bill 1483 becomes law
 
06:52:06.288 --> 06:52:06.298 align:start position:0%
in a situation where a law enforcement
 
06:52:08.690 --> 06:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
officer told the person who was running
 
06:52:10.548 --> 06:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
out of Walmart with an arm full of
 
06:52:13.368 --> 06:52:13.378 align:start position:0%
clothes to halt
 
06:52:15.830 --> 06:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
and the person did not stop
 
06:52:18.468 --> 06:52:18.478 align:start position:0%
in order to affect the arrest the law
 
06:52:20.570 --> 06:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer shot and killed the
 
06:52:22.070 --> 06:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
fleeing suspect
 
06:52:25.190 --> 06:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
in that situation with House Bill 1483
 
06:52:26.750 --> 06:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
becoming law
 
06:52:29.030 --> 06:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
that use of deadly force would not be
 
06:52:29.040 --> 06:52:33.288 align:start position:0%
that use of deadly force would not be
justified

06:52:33.288 --> 06:52:33.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:36.230 --> 06:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
what house bill 1483 does not change
 
06:52:39.048 --> 06:52:39.058 align:start position:0%
does not change at all is the legal
 
06:52:41.150 --> 06:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
right of a law enforcement officer to
 
06:52:43.190 --> 06:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
defend themselves
 
06:52:46.548 --> 06:52:46.558 align:start position:0%
to defend others from the criminal use
 
06:52:49.670 --> 06:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
of deadly force
 
06:52:53.150 --> 06:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1483 does not affect at all
 
06:52:55.430 --> 06:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
at all the legal right of a law
 
06:52:57.468 --> 06:52:57.478 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer to prevent The
 
06:52:59.930 --> 06:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
Escape of a person who has committed or
 
06:53:02.390 --> 06:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
is committing a felony involving the use
 
06:53:08.270 --> 06:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:10.070 --> 06:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
I have spoken to a number of law
 
06:53:11.690 --> 06:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers and they have all
 
06:53:14.570 --> 06:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
stated that they feel House Bill 1483
 
06:53:17.448 --> 06:53:17.458 align:start position:0%
would interfere or prevent them from
 
06:53:20.390 --> 06:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
effectively doing their job
 
06:53:22.368 --> 06:53:22.378 align:start position:0%
and I asked them would you ever use
 
06:53:25.250 --> 06:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
deadly force to stop a person fleeing
 
06:53:26.930 --> 06:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
from Walmart with some stolen clothes
 
06:53:29.150 --> 06:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
and they all said no they would not
 
06:53:30.890 --> 06:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
shoot somebody because they were
 
06:53:33.530 --> 06:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
stealing some clothes from Walmart
 
06:53:35.628 --> 06:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
I then asked the question for which I
 
06:53:38.868 --> 06:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
never got a reply that being the case
 
06:53:42.190 --> 06:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
how does how would House Bill 1483
 
06:53:45.948 --> 06:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
interfere with you doing your job
 
06:53:48.590 --> 06:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
my position is that the removal of the
 
06:53:51.110 --> 06:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
justification of the use of deadly force
 
06:53:53.150 --> 06:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
to affect an arrest
 
06:53:55.010 --> 06:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
which the police have told me they would
 
06:53:56.690 --> 06:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
never use anyway
 
06:53:58.968 --> 06:53:58.978 align:start position:0%
does not hinder or prevent law
 
06:54:01.190 --> 06:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement offices from performing
 
06:54:04.190 --> 06:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
their job in an effective and proper
 
06:54:04.200 --> 06:54:05.448 align:start position:0%
their job in an effective and proper
manner

06:54:05.448 --> 06:54:05.458 align:start position:0%
manner
 
06:54:08.090 --> 06:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1483 also amends The
 
06:54:10.910 --> 06:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
Sovereign by removing the justification
 
06:54:13.788 --> 06:54:13.798 align:start position:0%
for the use of deadly force based upon
 
06:54:16.430 --> 06:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
what the law officer believes is
 
06:54:16.440 --> 06:54:19.128 align:start position:0%
what the law officer believes is
reasonable

06:54:19.128 --> 06:54:19.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:20.930 --> 06:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
if there is a question
 
06:54:23.390 --> 06:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
whether the actions of a law enforcement
 
06:54:25.968 --> 06:54:25.978 align:start position:0%
officer's use of deadly force most
 
06:54:28.910 --> 06:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable or not
 
06:54:31.128 --> 06:54:31.138 align:start position:0%
that math question must not be decided
 
06:54:32.810 --> 06:54:32.820 align:start position:0%
by the officer
 
06:54:34.910 --> 06:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
that question must be decided by others
 
06:54:37.190 --> 06:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
such as Review Committee the Attorney
 
06:54:37.200 --> 06:54:38.390 align:start position:0%
such as Review Committee the Attorney
General

06:54:38.390 --> 06:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
General
 
06:54:41.208 --> 06:54:41.218 align:start position:0%
for the court system they are the ones
 
06:54:43.190 --> 06:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
who decide whether somebody's actions
 
06:54:44.930 --> 06:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
are reasonable or not
 
06:54:46.910 --> 06:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
the law officer
 
06:54:49.548 --> 06:54:49.558 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the committee thank
 
06:55:01.190 --> 06:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:02.690 --> 06:55:02.700 align:start position:0%
representative true if I can just ask
 
06:55:04.250 --> 06:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
one question
 
06:55:06.770 --> 06:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
under the existing law
 
06:55:09.770 --> 06:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
what is the justification of not having
 
06:55:11.690 --> 06:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
not permitting Force to prevent the
 
06:55:13.910 --> 06:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
Escape but not
 
06:55:15.830 --> 06:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
we're allowing a certain level of force
 
06:55:17.270 --> 06:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
be used to prevent an escape and not
 
06:55:19.430 --> 06:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
allow that same Force when affecting the
 
06:55:19.440 --> 06:55:22.548 align:start position:0%
allow that same Force when affecting the
rest

06:55:22.548 --> 06:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:22.558 --> 06:55:26.628 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:55:26.628 --> 06:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:28.430 --> 06:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
the current law this is talked about to
 
06:55:30.170 --> 06:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
prevent the escape from custody of a
 
06:55:32.030 --> 06:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
person who has committed or is
 
06:55:33.890 --> 06:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
committing a felony with the use of
 
06:55:37.910 --> 06:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
force violence or deadly weapon
 
06:55:40.490 --> 06:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
that's not being taken away from the
 
06:55:42.890 --> 06:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
authority of the law officer
 
06:55:46.610 --> 06:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
I'll rephrase my understanding is if
 
06:55:48.468 --> 06:55:48.478 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass
 
06:55:48.478 --> 06:55:50.628 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass
that

06:55:50.628 --> 06:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:55:52.788 --> 06:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
using that deadly force that you just
 
06:55:54.468 --> 06:55:54.478 align:start position:0%
described would not be permitted when
 
06:55:56.030 --> 06:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
affecting an arrest but it could still
 
06:55:58.490 --> 06:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
be used to prevent a suspect from
 
06:56:00.350 --> 06:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
escaping I'm asking what is the
 
06:56:02.090 --> 06:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
justification of reasoning for having
 
06:56:04.910 --> 06:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
permitting force a use of deadly force
 
06:56:07.310 --> 06:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
to prevent some from escaping but not
 
06:56:08.810 --> 06:56:08.820 align:start position:0%
allowing that same use of force when
 
06:56:11.448 --> 06:56:11.458 align:start position:0%
trying to arrest the suspect in the
 
06:56:13.610 --> 06:56:13.620 align:start position:0%
first place
 
06:56:17.868 --> 06:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
if somebody is trying to escape custody
 
06:56:21.770 --> 06:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:25.128 --> 06:56:25.138 align:start position:0%
that doesn't change at all
 
06:56:27.650 --> 06:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
I understand that but if they were
 
06:56:29.990 --> 06:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
trying to uh when if they were using
 
06:56:31.250 --> 06:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
that same
 
06:56:33.850 --> 06:56:33.860 align:start position:0%
deadly weapon in attempting to escape
 
06:56:35.810 --> 06:56:35.820 align:start position:0%
while they were trying to affect the
 
06:56:38.150 --> 06:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
arrest basically fleeing that would not
 
06:56:39.830 --> 06:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
permit it is the way I would read this
 
06:56:39.840 --> 06:56:41.930 align:start position:0%
permit it is the way I would read this
no

06:56:41.930 --> 06:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:56:44.208 --> 06:56:44.218 align:start position:0%
a law officer was justified in using
 
06:56:46.730 --> 06:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
deadly force only when
 
06:56:46.740 --> 06:56:47.868 align:start position:0%
deadly force only when
so

06:56:47.868 --> 06:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:56:51.770 --> 06:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
if an unarmed person
 
06:56:55.128 --> 06:56:55.138 align:start position:0%
not threatening anyone with any Force
 
06:56:56.868 --> 06:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
or violence
 
06:56:58.490 --> 06:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
is running away
 
06:57:01.010 --> 06:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
that person under this law
 
06:57:03.048 --> 06:57:03.058 align:start position:0%
may not be shot
 
06:57:06.110 --> 06:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to shoot that person
 
06:57:08.690 --> 06:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
if that person is carrying a weapon if
 
06:57:10.128 --> 06:57:10.138 align:start position:0%
that person has a knife and is
 
06:57:13.368 --> 06:57:13.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:15.830 --> 06:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
and the officer may act as he must act
 
06:57:22.128 --> 06:57:22.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:22.138 --> 06:57:23.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:57:23.350 --> 06:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:57:26.690 --> 06:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
all this all this change is
 
06:57:30.830 --> 06:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:32.690 --> 06:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is going to
 
06:57:36.650 --> 06:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
erase what is now in law in law we give
 
06:57:39.948 --> 06:57:39.958 align:start position:0%
the law officer the right
 
06:57:42.650 --> 06:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
to shoot somebody if they are fleeing
 
06:57:44.090 --> 06:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
from Walmart
 
06:57:47.868 --> 06:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
with some clothes made out of from China
 
06:57:50.330 --> 06:57:50.340 align:start position:0%
and they don't stop
 
06:57:52.368 --> 06:57:52.378 align:start position:0%
right now the police officer has the
 
06:57:54.770 --> 06:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
right the legal right
 
06:57:56.990 --> 06:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
to shoot that person
 
06:57:58.610 --> 06:57:58.620 align:start position:0%
and if
 
06:58:01.368 --> 06:58:01.378 align:start position:0%
and and without any repercussions
 
06:58:04.190 --> 06:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
because we've already said
 
06:58:05.930 --> 06:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
that the uh
 
06:58:08.150 --> 06:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
conduct which is Justified and it is
 
06:58:11.208 --> 06:58:11.218 align:start position:0%
Justified under this chapter constitutes
 
06:58:13.968 --> 06:58:13.978 align:start position:0%
a defense to any offense
 
06:58:16.788 --> 06:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing can be said to that
 
06:58:18.468 --> 06:58:18.478 align:start position:0%
officer now
 
06:58:20.750 --> 06:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
for shooting somebody fleeing with
 
06:58:22.850 --> 06:58:22.860 align:start position:0%
stolen clothes
 
06:58:25.010 --> 06:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
if that person is fleeing
 
06:58:29.150 --> 06:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
with stolen clothes and an armed weapon
 
06:58:38.170 --> 06:58:38.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:40.490 --> 06:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
represent representative Roy you were
 
06:58:40.500 --> 06:58:41.570 align:start position:0%
represent representative Roy you were
recognized

06:58:41.570 --> 06:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
06:58:43.128 --> 06:58:43.138 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
06:58:43.138 --> 06:58:44.390 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

06:58:44.390 --> 06:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:58:44.400 --> 06:58:45.410 align:start position:0%
question
um

06:58:45.410 --> 06:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:47.570 --> 06:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
I see you've stricken out he reasonably
 
06:58:49.968 --> 06:58:49.978 align:start position:0%
believes such force and replaced it with
 
06:58:51.708 --> 06:58:51.718 align:start position:0%
reasonably necessary
 
06:58:54.110 --> 06:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
where would a law enforcement officer go
 
06:58:57.110 --> 06:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
to look and see what's reasonable
 
06:58:59.990 --> 06:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh to the courts
 
06:59:01.430 --> 06:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
to a
 
06:59:04.128 --> 06:59:04.138 align:start position:0%
through a View Board
 
06:59:04.138 --> 06:59:05.030 align:start position:0%
through a View Board
um

06:59:05.030 --> 06:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:59:06.708 --> 06:59:06.718 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a follow-up
 
06:59:06.718 --> 06:59:08.208 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a follow-up
question

06:59:08.208 --> 06:59:08.218 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:59:11.030 --> 06:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
those are all after the fact but in the
 
06:59:13.548 --> 06:59:13.558 align:start position:0%
instant for if I may give you an example
 
06:59:16.850 --> 06:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
an officer pulls over someone the person
 
06:59:19.490 --> 06:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
exits the vehicle it's dark the officer
 
06:59:20.990 --> 06:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
says show me your hands and the person
 
06:59:23.448 --> 06:59:23.458 align:start position:0%
reaches into the car is the officer
 
06:59:27.770 --> 06:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:30.230 --> 06:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
that would be in a court case that would
 
06:59:32.690 --> 06:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
be decided in the court case it wouldn't
 
06:59:34.788 --> 06:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
be decided then
 
06:59:38.868 --> 06:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:41.090 --> 06:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
continue to follow
 
06:59:42.830 --> 06:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
you recognize for a follow-up question
 
06:59:44.930 --> 06:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to understand your
 
06:59:47.270 --> 06:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
reasoning I agreed that they would all
 
06:59:48.890 --> 06:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
be reviewed afterward in the court but
 
06:59:51.890 --> 06:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
on the side of that road at 3 A.M what
 
06:59:53.930 --> 06:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
does the officer rely on to to decide
 
06:59:55.310 --> 06:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not he can discharge his
 
06:59:58.310 --> 06:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
firearm when he sees someone reaching
 
07:00:00.350 --> 07:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
into a car after he's ordered him to
 
07:00:02.990 --> 07:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
show him his hands where does the
 
07:00:05.208 --> 07:00:05.218 align:start position:0%
officer where does he how does he make
 
07:00:06.910 --> 07:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
that decision whether or not to to
 
07:00:09.048 --> 07:00:09.058 align:start position:0%
discharge his firearm he makes that
 
07:00:10.968 --> 07:00:10.978 align:start position:0%
professional decision at the time based
 
07:00:13.850 --> 07:00:13.860 align:start position:0%
on all all facts you know and what what
 
07:00:16.670 --> 07:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
he can see and what he's surrounded with
 
07:00:19.190 --> 07:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
um keep in mind
 
07:00:22.490 --> 07:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
the reason why I removed that yeah
 
07:00:22.500 --> 07:00:23.390 align:start position:0%
the reason why I removed that yeah
um

07:00:23.390 --> 07:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:23.400 --> 07:00:26.208 align:start position:0%
um
is

07:00:26.208 --> 07:00:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:28.610 --> 07:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
conduct which is justifiable under this
 
07:00:30.410 --> 07:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
chapter constitutes a defense to any
 
07:00:30.420 --> 07:00:32.150 align:start position:0%
chapter constitutes a defense to any
offense

07:00:32.150 --> 07:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
offense
 
07:00:35.150 --> 07:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
I thought I was being reasonable
 
07:00:37.368 --> 07:00:37.378 align:start position:0%
well that's in the law as it stands now
 
07:00:40.548 --> 07:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
if he felt he was being reasonable there
 
07:00:43.610 --> 07:00:43.620 align:start position:0%
is his defense I am saying it's not up
 
07:00:45.410 --> 07:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
to the office officer makes his best
 
07:00:48.530 --> 07:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
choice best decisions they're not always
 
07:00:48.540 --> 07:00:50.868 align:start position:0%
choice best decisions they're not always
correct

07:00:50.868 --> 07:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
correct
 
07:00:52.490 --> 07:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
um it's not up to the opposite of the
 
07:00:55.910 --> 07:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:59.690 --> 07:00:59.700 align:start position:0%
it would be up to his police chief the
 
07:01:02.448 --> 07:01:02.458 align:start position:0%
board that reviews the situation or if
 
07:01:05.330 --> 07:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
it's going to a court case
 
07:01:07.810 --> 07:01:07.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:01:09.948 --> 07:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
representative Platt
 
07:01:11.570 --> 07:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
07:01:14.208 --> 07:01:14.218 align:start position:0%
question your bill would allow the
 
07:01:17.390 --> 07:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
officer to use a Taser or other physical
 
07:01:19.610 --> 07:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
means to stop somebody from fleeing I'll
 
07:01:23.030 --> 07:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
pick on target rather than Walmart
 
07:01:23.040 --> 07:01:23.868 align:start position:0%
pick on target rather than Walmart
um

07:01:23.868 --> 07:01:23.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:01:28.310 --> 07:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:33.830 --> 07:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:40.490 --> 07:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:41.930 --> 07:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
the value
 
07:01:45.110 --> 07:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
of some stolen clothes
 
07:01:47.990 --> 07:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
is not worth
 
07:01:51.170 --> 07:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
somebody being shot or losing their life
 
07:01:51.180 --> 07:01:56.448 align:start position:0%
somebody being shot or losing their life
over

07:01:56.448 --> 07:01:56.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:00.288 --> 07:02:00.298 align:start position:0%
representative true cheer me inquired so
 
07:02:01.968 --> 07:02:01.978 align:start position:0%
I understand the example you're using
 
07:02:03.468 --> 07:02:03.478 align:start position:0%
someone's at a department store and
 
07:02:05.330 --> 07:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
they're fleeing with with clothes
 
07:02:09.830 --> 07:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
where under RSA 627 colon 5 does it say
 
07:02:11.990 --> 07:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
that you can shoot an unarmed person in
 
07:02:13.788 --> 07:02:13.798 align:start position:0%
the back running away with stolen
 
07:02:13.798 --> 07:02:15.468 align:start position:0%
the back running away with stolen
merchandise

07:02:15.468 --> 07:02:15.478 align:start position:0%
merchandise
 
07:02:18.048 --> 07:02:18.058 align:start position:0%
the law officer is Justified and used in
 
07:02:20.330 --> 07:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
deadly force
 
07:02:22.910 --> 07:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
to affect and arrest
 
07:02:25.070 --> 07:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
stop you're under arrest
 
07:02:25.080 --> 07:02:26.330 align:start position:0%
stop you're under arrest
stop

07:02:26.330 --> 07:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
stop
 
07:02:29.150 --> 07:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
therefore the way the law reads now
 
07:02:31.548 --> 07:02:31.558 align:start position:0%
he's trying to affect an arrest
 
07:02:38.750 --> 07:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:41.810 --> 07:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
a law officer is Justified in using
 
07:02:44.090 --> 07:02:44.100 align:start position:0%
deadly force only when
 
07:02:46.610 --> 07:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
he reasonably believes such force is
 
07:02:48.590 --> 07:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
reasonably necessary
 
07:02:51.948 --> 07:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:54.230 --> 07:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
and my point being
 
07:02:56.990 --> 07:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you that deadly force
 
07:03:08.288 --> 07:03:08.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:11.208 --> 07:03:11.218 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes
 
07:03:13.670 --> 07:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
chairman representative are you familiar
 
07:03:16.610 --> 07:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
with the terminology anything can be a
 
07:03:19.368 --> 07:03:19.378 align:start position:0%
weapon with a proper imagination
 
07:03:19.378 --> 07:03:22.030 align:start position:0%
weapon with a proper imagination
no

07:03:22.030 --> 07:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:24.170 --> 07:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
would you agree that somebody could kill
 
07:03:26.930 --> 07:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
somebody with a pen
 
07:03:29.570 --> 07:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:03:34.190 --> 07:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:49.090 --> 07:03:49.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:51.410 --> 07:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
representative green my apologies you're
 
07:03:51.420 --> 07:03:52.430 align:start position:0%
representative green my apologies you're
recognized

07:03:52.430 --> 07:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
07:03:57.830 --> 07:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:57.840 --> 07:03:59.570 align:start position:0%
 
uh

07:03:59.570 --> 07:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:04:01.070 --> 07:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
there's an incident where a person
 
07:04:03.530 --> 07:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
instead of running away with clothing
 
07:04:06.948 --> 07:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
uh grabbed a lady's pocketbook and
 
07:04:09.530 --> 07:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
forced her to the ground and her head
 
07:04:11.410 --> 07:04:11.420 align:start position:0%
was bleeding
 
07:04:13.910 --> 07:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
excessively and he's running away with
 
07:04:15.288 --> 07:04:15.298 align:start position:0%
her pocketbook
 
07:04:16.968 --> 07:04:16.978 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the police officer have the
 
07:04:21.410 --> 07:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:21.420 --> 07:04:24.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:04:24.250 --> 07:04:24.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:26.750 --> 07:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
has committed a felony
 
07:04:29.448 --> 07:04:29.458 align:start position:0%
uh committing a felony involving use of
 
07:04:31.250 --> 07:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
force or violence
 
07:04:33.230 --> 07:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
using a deadly weather and attempting to
 
07:04:35.330 --> 07:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
escape or otherwise indicates that
 
07:04:37.610 --> 07:04:37.620 align:start position:0%
person is likely to seriously endanger
 
07:04:40.368 --> 07:04:40.378 align:start position:0%
human life or inflict serious bodily yes
 
07:04:42.650 --> 07:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
that's that's still in the law thank you
 
07:04:49.310 --> 07:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:55.788 --> 07:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:57.890 --> 07:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
this time the chair recognizes
 
07:05:23.570 --> 07:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:26.208 --> 07:05:26.218 align:start position:0%
is it working now
 
07:05:27.650 --> 07:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to make this brief I know
 
07:05:29.170 --> 07:05:29.180 align:start position:0%
it's a Friday afternoon
 
07:05:30.948 --> 07:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
so the first thing I'd like to address
 
07:05:33.170 --> 07:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
is the representative was talking about
 
07:05:34.850 --> 07:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
the the example of someone fleeing
 
07:05:34.860 --> 07:05:35.750 align:start position:0%
the the example of someone fleeing
Walmart

07:05:35.750 --> 07:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
Walmart
 
07:05:35.760 --> 07:05:37.150 align:start position:0%
Walmart
um

07:05:37.150 --> 07:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:40.010 --> 07:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
what he was describing is just not it's
 
07:05:43.968 --> 07:05:43.978 align:start position:0%
it's not the case if you look at the law
 
07:05:46.310 --> 07:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
um under Section B subsection one there
 
07:05:48.530 --> 07:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
are some other standards that need to be
 
07:05:50.868 --> 07:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
met before someone can shoot somebody in
 
07:05:53.150 --> 07:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
the back as he said that person needs to
 
07:05:54.410 --> 07:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
be committing a felony involving the use
 
07:05:55.910 --> 07:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
of force of balance using a deadly
 
07:05:56.990 --> 07:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
weapon and attempting to escape or
 
07:05:58.788 --> 07:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
otherwise indicated that he's
 
07:06:00.948 --> 07:06:00.958 align:start position:0%
endangering human life or will inflict
 
07:06:03.368 --> 07:06:03.378 align:start position:0%
serious bottom injury so that scenario
 
07:06:05.930 --> 07:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
that the representative
 
07:06:08.750 --> 07:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
was describing is just not accurate
 
07:06:08.760 --> 07:06:10.250 align:start position:0%
was describing is just not accurate
um

07:06:10.250 --> 07:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:06:13.128 --> 07:06:13.138 align:start position:0%
so that aside I'm going to be addressing
 
07:06:15.170 --> 07:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
what we feel
 
07:06:17.330 --> 07:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
is the most
 
07:06:17.340 --> 07:06:18.530 align:start position:0%
is the most
um

07:06:18.530 --> 07:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:06:21.110 --> 07:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
kind of urgent part of this bill that
 
07:06:22.670 --> 07:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
would cause serious issues for the law
 
07:06:24.410 --> 07:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement community and that is the
 
07:06:26.208 --> 07:06:26.218 align:start position:0%
removal of the reasonably believes
 
07:06:28.368 --> 07:06:28.378 align:start position:0%
language from the statute
 
07:06:31.788 --> 07:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
so my current assignment is the training
 
07:06:33.048 --> 07:06:33.058 align:start position:0%
director for the Department I sit on our
 
07:06:35.150 --> 07:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
use of force Committee in my written
 
07:06:37.850 --> 07:06:37.860 align:start position:0%
testimony I put all my my credentials uh
 
07:06:40.730 --> 07:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
I have 14 years experience I hold
 
07:06:42.230 --> 07:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
instructor certification on basically
 
07:06:46.430 --> 07:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:48.708 --> 07:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
and that reasonably believes language is
 
07:06:50.990 --> 07:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
essential for a law enforcement officer
 
07:06:53.390 --> 07:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
doing their job that
 
07:06:56.390 --> 07:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
comes from the U.S Supreme Court case
 
07:06:58.190 --> 07:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
Grand recliner which I'm sure everyone
 
07:07:00.048 --> 07:07:00.058 align:start position:0%
is is familiar with
 
07:07:01.910 --> 07:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
which gives law enforcement officers the
 
07:07:04.310 --> 07:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
objective objective objective reasonable
 
07:07:04.320 --> 07:07:05.570 align:start position:0%
objective objective objective reasonable
standard

07:07:05.570 --> 07:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
standard
 
07:07:08.990 --> 07:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
when applying Force so I'm just going to
 
07:07:10.910 --> 07:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
read directly from chief chief justice
 
07:07:12.590 --> 07:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
rehnquist majority opinion in that case
 
07:07:15.170 --> 07:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
and that just outlines that standard and
 
07:07:17.208 --> 07:07:17.218 align:start position:0%
why the reasonably believed language is
 
07:07:18.948 --> 07:07:18.958 align:start position:0%
so necessary for us better than I could
 
07:07:20.930 --> 07:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
kind of put it so I'll make it as quick
 
07:07:23.448 --> 07:07:23.458 align:start position:0%
as I can he wrote the reasonableness of
 
07:07:25.250 --> 07:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
a particular use of force must be judged
 
07:07:26.690 --> 07:07:26.700 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of a reasonable
 
07:07:29.150 --> 07:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
officer on scene rather than with 2020
 
07:07:30.890 --> 07:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
vision of hindsight
 
07:07:32.570 --> 07:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
you're going to say the calculus of
 
07:07:34.430 --> 07:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
reasonableness must embody allowance for
 
07:07:36.530 --> 07:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
the fact police officers are often
 
07:07:38.208 --> 07:07:38.218 align:start position:0%
forced to make split sex and judgment
 
07:07:40.010 --> 07:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
and circumstances that are tense
 
07:07:42.410 --> 07:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
uncertain and rapidly evolving about the
 
07:07:44.208 --> 07:07:44.218 align:start position:0%
amount of force that is necessary in a
 
07:07:46.128 --> 07:07:46.138 align:start position:0%
particular situation
 
07:07:47.810 --> 07:07:47.820 align:start position:0%
in my 14-year career I've been president
 
07:07:50.030 --> 07:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
for three separate officer-involved
 
07:07:51.708 --> 07:07:51.718 align:start position:0%
shooting incidents one of which my
 
07:07:53.868 --> 07:07:53.878 align:start position:0%
fellow officers actions saved my life in
 
07:07:54.948 --> 07:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
my opinion
 
07:07:57.590 --> 07:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
each one of those situations were
 
07:08:00.650 --> 07:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
extremely fast developing stressful
 
07:08:02.690 --> 07:08:02.700 align:start position:0%
and required the officers to make those
 
07:08:04.968 --> 07:08:04.978 align:start position:0%
split-second decisions only with the
 
07:08:08.150 --> 07:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
information they had at the time
 
07:08:10.368 --> 07:08:10.378 align:start position:0%
so those officers and any officers in
 
07:08:12.170 --> 07:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
such an incident can only act with the
 
07:08:13.788 --> 07:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
information they have that's kind of the
 
07:08:15.170 --> 07:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
essence of the reasonably believes
 
07:08:18.650 --> 07:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
language in that in the RSA
 
07:08:20.750 --> 07:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
um our training in New Hampshire has
 
07:08:23.030 --> 07:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
come a long way uh at the MPD we are now
 
07:08:25.070 --> 07:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
given our officers 40 hours annually
 
07:08:27.170 --> 07:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
training uh every year they get a
 
07:08:28.670 --> 07:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
minimum of 40 hours which is a massive
 
07:08:30.708 --> 07:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
increase from historically what New
 
07:08:32.868 --> 07:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire officers have gotten
 
07:08:34.430 --> 07:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
much of that is
 
07:08:36.590 --> 07:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated to de-escalation less lethal
 
07:08:38.690 --> 07:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
and scenario training and this all the
 
07:08:40.070 --> 07:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
training we give and all the training we
 
07:08:42.410 --> 07:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
ever could give can only expect our
 
07:08:45.230 --> 07:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
officers to respond with the information
 
07:08:48.048 --> 07:08:48.058 align:start position:0%
they have at the time which is
 
07:08:49.930 --> 07:08:49.940 align:start position:0%
basically what that reasonably believes
 
07:08:52.730 --> 07:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
language is based in
 
07:08:52.740 --> 07:08:54.170 align:start position:0%
language is based in
um

07:08:54.170 --> 07:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:08:57.110 --> 07:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
so I think the most basic example of
 
07:08:59.510 --> 07:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
this that can kind of illustrate it is
 
07:09:01.610 --> 07:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
one that happens quite often you've seen
 
07:09:02.750 --> 07:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
we all see in the news throughout the
 
07:09:05.150 --> 07:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
country unfortunately is when a person
 
07:09:08.628 --> 07:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
uses a toy or replica firearm in
 
07:09:10.730 --> 07:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
confrontations with police officers
 
07:09:13.010 --> 07:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
so if a person points a replica firearm
 
07:09:14.868 --> 07:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
on an officer or a third party the
 
07:09:17.150 --> 07:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
officer on scene reasonably believes
 
07:09:18.890 --> 07:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
that deadly force is about to be used
 
07:09:21.468 --> 07:09:21.478 align:start position:0%
against them or someone else
 
07:09:24.468 --> 07:09:24.478 align:start position:0%
so they will be justified in firing
 
07:09:25.850 --> 07:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
their weapon
 
07:09:27.830 --> 07:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
now if you remove that reasonable belief
 
07:09:29.690 --> 07:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
language and replace it with the
 
07:09:31.310 --> 07:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
reasonably necessary
 
07:09:33.350 --> 07:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
looking after the fact
 
07:09:35.390 --> 07:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
it was not reasonably necessary to use
 
07:09:37.670 --> 07:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
that Force because in reality that toy
 
07:09:37.680 --> 07:09:38.570 align:start position:0%
that Force because in reality that toy
gun

07:09:38.570 --> 07:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
gun
 
07:09:40.490 --> 07:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
was not going to hurt anyone
 
07:09:44.330 --> 07:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
okay so that is what that will do if you
 
07:09:46.310 --> 07:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
take away reasonably believes it holds
 
07:09:48.948 --> 07:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
officers to a standard that is basically
 
07:09:50.750 --> 07:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
impossible for them to prepare for a
 
07:09:51.948 --> 07:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
train for
 
07:09:51.958 --> 07:09:53.628 align:start position:0%
train for
um

07:09:53.628 --> 07:09:53.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:55.910 --> 07:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
furthermore as far as I in my you know
 
07:09:58.368 --> 07:09:58.378 align:start position:0%
brief research every single state
 
07:10:00.948 --> 07:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
in the United States has some form of
 
07:10:04.010 --> 07:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
the reasonable belief language in their
 
07:10:07.190 --> 07:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
deadly four statutes I cite a couple uh
 
07:10:09.948 --> 07:10:09.958 align:start position:0%
in my written testimony
 
07:10:12.708 --> 07:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
I could not find any state that has
 
07:10:14.750 --> 07:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
anything other than that I think like I
 
07:10:15.890 --> 07:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
said that all goes back to Graham V
 
07:10:17.448 --> 07:10:17.458 align:start position:0%
Conor and that objectable reasonable in
 
07:10:18.530 --> 07:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
the standard
 
07:10:18.540 --> 07:10:21.230 align:start position:0%
the standard
um

07:10:21.230 --> 07:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:23.750 --> 07:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
so and I don't point that out to say New
 
07:10:25.070 --> 07:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it needs to be like everyone
 
07:10:27.650 --> 07:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
else because we are not we're a very
 
07:10:29.750 --> 07:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
unique State and and
 
07:10:31.788 --> 07:10:31.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of you know in a lot of good ways
 
07:10:35.810 --> 07:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
in my opinion but for this specific
 
07:10:39.170 --> 07:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
case it's a standard Across the Nation
 
07:10:40.788 --> 07:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
and a standard and U.S Supreme Court
 
07:10:43.010 --> 07:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
case law for a reason because of you you
 
07:10:44.570 --> 07:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
cannot do your job as a police officer
 
07:10:47.090 --> 07:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
in any other way all we can like I said
 
07:10:49.070 --> 07:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
again all we can train for and all we
 
07:10:50.690 --> 07:10:50.700 align:start position:0%
can prepare officers for
 
07:10:53.330 --> 07:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
is to encounter and make decisions they
 
07:10:55.850 --> 07:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
can for what they reasonably believe
 
07:10:59.570 --> 07:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:01.190 --> 07:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
so and
 
07:11:02.990 --> 07:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
closing I was an honor to submit my
 
07:11:04.368 --> 07:11:04.378 align:start position:0%
testimony today this is my first time I
 
07:11:05.990 --> 07:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
apologize if I apologize if I was a bit
 
07:11:07.610 --> 07:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
nervous or didn't make sense
 
07:11:09.048 --> 07:11:09.058 align:start position:0%
um but
 
07:11:11.448 --> 07:11:11.458 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it it was an honor and
 
07:11:13.730 --> 07:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
please find this bill in an expedient to
 
07:11:17.628 --> 07:11:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:21.350 --> 07:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:24.468 --> 07:11:24.478 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
07:11:26.510 --> 07:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony thank
 
07:11:27.770 --> 07:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
you sir
 
07:11:30.650 --> 07:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
in your years of experience
 
07:11:33.230 --> 07:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
and fellow officers that you associate
 
07:11:33.240 --> 07:11:34.730 align:start position:0%
and fellow officers that you associate
with

07:11:34.730 --> 07:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
with
 
07:11:37.430 --> 07:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
have you ever heard of an officer doing
 
07:11:39.430 --> 07:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
something that the
 
07:11:41.810 --> 07:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
representative brought up in his
 
07:11:44.330 --> 07:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
demonstration of somebody shooting an
 
07:11:46.490 --> 07:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
officer shooting somebody leaving a
 
07:11:49.788 --> 07:11:49.798 align:start position:0%
store with clothes in their hands
 
07:11:51.590 --> 07:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
no I haven't
 
07:11:53.330 --> 07:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
um the closest thing I can think of
 
07:11:55.128 --> 07:11:55.138 align:start position:0%
which would I cannot think of the name
 
07:11:56.030 --> 07:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
of it
 
07:11:56.040 --> 07:11:56.868 align:start position:0%
of it
um

07:11:56.868 --> 07:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:11:58.190 --> 07:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
but I believe it was South Carolina
 
07:12:00.708 --> 07:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
where the met with the officer it was on
 
07:12:00.718 --> 07:12:01.850 align:start position:0%
where the met with the officer it was on
video

07:12:01.850 --> 07:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
video
 
07:12:03.288 --> 07:12:03.298 align:start position:0%
shot the man in the back as he was
 
07:12:04.610 --> 07:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
running and then dropped the taser on
 
07:12:06.770 --> 07:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
him and that officer was correctly
 
07:12:09.110 --> 07:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
charged with homicide and is now in
 
07:12:11.570 --> 07:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
prison if you do that in this state or
 
07:12:14.030 --> 07:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
any other state shoot a shoplifter in
 
07:12:16.070 --> 07:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
the back with a handful of clothes
 
07:12:17.750 --> 07:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
you will be arrested and charged as a
 
07:12:22.788 --> 07:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:22.798 --> 07:12:25.788 align:start position:0%
 
representative

07:12:25.788 --> 07:12:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:28.610 --> 07:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
did I just hear you say in so many words
 
07:12:30.350 --> 07:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
that this bill is totally unnecessary
 
07:12:32.270 --> 07:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
because you can't shoot somebody into
 
07:12:33.910 --> 07:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
running anyway
 
07:12:36.170 --> 07:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
07:12:41.208 --> 07:12:41.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:42.590 --> 07:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to ask a question myself
 
07:12:44.448 --> 07:12:44.458 align:start position:0%
could you please tell the committee
 
07:12:46.850 --> 07:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
under what circumstances you can fire at
 
07:12:48.230 --> 07:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
a fleeing felon
 
07:12:51.110 --> 07:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
so if for instance I'll give an example
 
07:12:54.110 --> 07:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
of say an active shooter type call where
 
07:12:56.208 --> 07:12:56.218 align:start position:0%
you arrive you have several people that
 
07:12:57.948 --> 07:12:57.958 align:start position:0%
are injured you see a Suspect with a
 
07:13:00.288 --> 07:13:00.298 align:start position:0%
weapon who is fleeing from you
 
07:13:01.788 --> 07:13:01.798 align:start position:0%
that would be a case we could do it
 
07:13:04.128 --> 07:13:04.138 align:start position:0%
where you reasonably believe that person
 
07:13:06.530 --> 07:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
is going to continue to attack and
 
07:13:09.288 --> 07:13:09.298 align:start position:0%
injure uh innocent civilians that you
 
07:13:11.270 --> 07:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
can shoot a fleeing felon that's kind of
 
07:13:12.708 --> 07:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
the most clear example I could give you
 
07:13:12.718 --> 07:13:14.690 align:start position:0%
the most clear example I could give you
sir

07:13:14.690 --> 07:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
sir
 
07:13:17.690 --> 07:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
under uh one more question and in your
 
07:13:20.448 --> 07:13:20.458 align:start position:0%
experience in law enforcement
 
07:13:23.090 --> 07:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
um how many times have you heard of
 
07:13:25.010 --> 07:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
um any officers in New Hampshire firing
 
07:13:27.788 --> 07:13:27.798 align:start position:0%
at a fleeing felon
 
07:13:30.770 --> 07:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
I've heard I think there was a case in I
 
07:13:32.810 --> 07:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
believe it was where
 
07:13:32.820 --> 07:13:34.128 align:start position:0%
believe it was where
um

07:13:34.128 --> 07:13:34.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:13:36.948 --> 07:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
some years back where officers fired at
 
07:13:38.510 --> 07:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
a vehicle that was driving away from
 
07:13:39.468 --> 07:13:39.478 align:start position:0%
them I'm not sure the exact
 
07:13:41.330 --> 07:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
circumstances but that's really the only
 
07:13:42.948 --> 07:13:42.958 align:start position:0%
one that can come to mind
 
07:13:44.990 --> 07:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
so it would be fair to say it's a rare
 
07:13:47.150 --> 07:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
very rare occurrence extremely rare yes
 
07:13:51.350 --> 07:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:53.090 --> 07:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
see enough further questions thank you
 
07:14:18.468 --> 07:14:18.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:32.448 --> 07:14:32.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:34.250 --> 07:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
a little bit wider than sergeant
 
07:14:34.260 --> 07:14:35.390 align:start position:0%
a little bit wider than sergeant

07:14:37.610 --> 07:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman Roy and members
 
07:14:39.708 --> 07:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm Roger lamarsh I
 
07:14:41.030 --> 07:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
serve as a lieutenant for the Hudson
 
07:14:42.890 --> 07:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
Police Department I've been with the
 
07:14:46.010 --> 07:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
agency since December of 2004. and part
 
07:14:47.930 --> 07:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
of my assignment as a lieutenant with
 
07:14:49.548 --> 07:14:49.558 align:start position:0%
the police department I'm a usual Force
 
07:14:51.170 --> 07:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
instructor from my agency
 
07:14:53.448 --> 07:14:53.458 align:start position:0%
I also serve as a user Force instructor
 
07:14:54.590 --> 07:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
for the Southern New Hampshire Special
 
07:14:57.110 --> 07:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
Operations unit and I've also performed
 
07:14:59.150 --> 07:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
functions as an instructor at the New
 
07:15:00.530 --> 07:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tactical offices Association
 
07:15:02.868 --> 07:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
SWAT school so I'm pretty well versed in
 
07:15:05.270 --> 07:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
use of force training especially deadly
 
07:15:05.280 --> 07:15:06.910 align:start position:0%
use of force training especially deadly
force

07:15:06.910 --> 07:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
force
 
07:15:09.468 --> 07:15:09.478 align:start position:0%
as invested stakeholders
 
07:15:11.030 --> 07:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
police officers
 
07:15:12.890 --> 07:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
we look in the mirror when we feel like
 
07:15:14.330 --> 07:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
there are problems with law enforcement
 
07:15:16.670 --> 07:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
because if there are problems with our
 
07:15:19.548 --> 07:15:19.558 align:start position:0%
job we want to be a part of the solution
 
07:15:21.230 --> 07:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure of any problems that we're
 
07:15:22.850 --> 07:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
having in the state right now with with
 
07:15:24.530 --> 07:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
people being shot
 
07:15:27.410 --> 07:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
with without good reason
 
07:15:28.850 --> 07:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
um it's just it's just not there you
 
07:15:31.730 --> 07:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
would ask Sergeant Cataldo
 
07:15:34.128 --> 07:15:34.138 align:start position:0%
and it's a very rare occasion if if at
 
07:15:37.070 --> 07:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
all I can't think of any instances
 
07:15:37.080 --> 07:15:37.910 align:start position:0%
all I can't think of any instances
um

07:15:37.910 --> 07:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:15:39.830 --> 07:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
when we train our police officers in the
 
07:15:42.650 --> 07:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
state deadly force is a last resort
 
07:15:45.468 --> 07:15:45.478 align:start position:0%
I can assure you every time an officer
 
07:15:47.270 --> 07:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
is strapping on his boots
 
07:15:49.368 --> 07:15:49.378 align:start position:0%
putting on her belt
 
07:15:51.288 --> 07:15:51.298 align:start position:0%
the last thing they want to do is have
 
07:15:53.030 --> 07:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
to discharge their firearm and the
 
07:15:55.548 --> 07:15:55.558 align:start position:0%
execution of their duties
 
07:15:57.530 --> 07:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
I don't have any issues modifying the
 
07:15:59.330 --> 07:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
statute I I see some language in there
 
07:16:00.530 --> 07:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
that makes the statute more gender
 
07:16:03.048 --> 07:16:03.058 align:start position:0%
neutral obviously as police officers we
 
07:16:05.150 --> 07:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to carry any bias or perform
 
07:16:07.850 --> 07:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
our job with prejudice and if if there
 
07:16:09.530 --> 07:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
are if there is language that's going to
 
07:16:12.650 --> 07:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
make the statue apply to everyone more
 
07:16:15.110 --> 07:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
effectively I'm all about that I don't
 
07:16:16.670 --> 07:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
take issue with the language that makes
 
07:16:18.830 --> 07:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
it more gender-neutral the concern I
 
07:16:21.830 --> 07:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
have is is changing that statute like
 
07:16:24.650 --> 07:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
Sergeant Cataldo spoke about is that
 
07:16:27.530 --> 07:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
standard of objective reasonableness
 
07:16:30.048 --> 07:16:30.058 align:start position:0%
we hold our officers to that standard
 
07:16:33.070 --> 07:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
because these deadly force situations
 
07:16:35.628 --> 07:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
are rapidly evolving
 
07:16:37.788 --> 07:16:37.798 align:start position:0%
their their situations that are
 
07:16:39.770 --> 07:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
obviously it's a it's a life or death
 
07:16:39.780 --> 07:16:40.850 align:start position:0%
obviously it's a it's a life or death
scenario

07:16:40.850 --> 07:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
07:16:42.230 --> 07:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
and there are three things that are
 
07:16:43.310 --> 07:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
going to happen an office is going to
 
07:16:45.110 --> 07:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
freeze they're going to fight or they're
 
07:16:46.250 --> 07:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
going to run
 
07:16:49.010 --> 07:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
and depending on what their action is if
 
07:16:50.750 --> 07:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
they're they're presented with a deadly
 
07:16:50.760 --> 07:16:51.708 align:start position:0%
they're they're presented with a deadly
force

07:16:51.708 --> 07:16:51.718 align:start position:0%
force
 
07:16:53.448 --> 07:16:53.458 align:start position:0%
concern they have to address that
 
07:16:54.590 --> 07:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
appropriately not just to protect
 
07:16:56.750 --> 07:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
themselves but our job is to protect and
 
07:16:58.430 --> 07:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
serve the communities
 
07:16:59.750 --> 07:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
and if we're not able to do that
 
07:16:59.760 --> 07:17:01.010 align:start position:0%
and if we're not able to do that
effectively

07:17:01.010 --> 07:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
07:17:03.650 --> 07:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
and use deadly force when appropriate to
 
07:17:05.150 --> 07:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
protect other people we're not doing our
 
07:17:05.160 --> 07:17:07.368 align:start position:0%
protect other people we're not doing our
job

07:17:07.368 --> 07:17:07.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:09.468 --> 07:17:09.478 align:start position:0%
um two thousand feet per second that's
 
07:17:11.570 --> 07:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
just that's the average velocity of a
 
07:17:13.368 --> 07:17:13.378 align:start position:0%
firearm round that's the time we're
 
07:17:15.708 --> 07:17:15.718 align:start position:0%
talking about here officers are always
 
07:17:18.530 --> 07:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
behind the eight ball we are reactive
 
07:17:20.990 --> 07:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
the law as it stands right now levels
 
07:17:23.570 --> 07:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
the playing field it allows us to do the
 
07:17:25.490 --> 07:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
best job we can to weigh the
 
07:17:27.410 --> 07:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
circumstance and take appropriate action
 
07:17:30.650 --> 07:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
if the language change happens we don't
 
07:17:32.330 --> 07:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
know who decides what that
 
07:17:34.490 --> 07:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
reasonableness is and that's very
 
07:17:36.170 --> 07:17:36.180 align:start position:0%
concerning when it comes to talking
 
07:17:38.690 --> 07:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
about fleeing felons the U.S Supreme
 
07:17:39.948 --> 07:17:39.958 align:start position:0%
Court has already addressed that with
 
07:17:41.990 --> 07:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
Tennessee V Garner that's the fleeing
 
07:17:44.690 --> 07:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
felon rule we go over Granby Connor
 
07:17:47.208 --> 07:17:47.218 align:start position:0%
Tennessee V Garner Tennessee V Garner
 
07:17:49.190 --> 07:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to get into that with too
 
07:17:52.910 --> 07:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
much uh substance but it essentially
 
07:17:56.510 --> 07:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
rules are out on using deadly force to
 
07:17:58.788 --> 07:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
stop a fleeing felon unless those other
 
07:18:00.948 --> 07:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
circumstances are present there has to
 
07:18:02.810 --> 07:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
be deadly force and that's where we meet
 
07:18:05.510 --> 07:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
it with deadly force so
 
07:18:05.520 --> 07:18:07.190 align:start position:0%
it with deadly force so
um

07:18:07.190 --> 07:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:18:09.948 --> 07:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:13.190 --> 07:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
the concern to to change the statute is
 
07:18:14.810 --> 07:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
going to cause our officers to have more
 
07:18:17.510 --> 07:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
delay more hesitation
 
07:18:20.090 --> 07:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
and then essentially cause possibly cost
 
07:18:20.100 --> 07:18:21.170 align:start position:0%
and then essentially cause possibly cost
lives

07:18:21.170 --> 07:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
lives
 
07:18:23.930 --> 07:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
so I do have printed testimony it's a
 
07:18:25.910 --> 07:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
heartfelt letter you'll be able to read
 
07:18:25.920 --> 07:18:27.048 align:start position:0%
heartfelt letter you'll be able to read
that

07:18:27.048 --> 07:18:27.058 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:18:27.058 --> 07:18:27.770 align:start position:0%
that
um

07:18:27.770 --> 07:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:18:27.780 --> 07:18:29.270 align:start position:0%
um
but

07:18:29.270 --> 07:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:18:30.830 --> 07:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
if there is a problem that we have in
 
07:18:32.030 --> 07:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
the state with officers using
 
07:18:34.250 --> 07:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
unreasonable Force the best way to do
 
07:18:36.530 --> 07:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
that is not to legislate change it's
 
07:18:38.930 --> 07:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
going to be to give us more training
 
07:18:40.850 --> 07:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
and not just mandate the more training
 
07:18:43.190 --> 07:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
but it is it's going to cost
 
07:18:45.590 --> 07:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to need those resources to
 
07:18:46.910 --> 07:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
give the officers the more training we
 
07:18:48.770 --> 07:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
can provide unfortunately that does take
 
07:18:52.070 --> 07:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
time and and everything else so
 
07:18:53.628 --> 07:18:53.638 align:start position:0%
that's that's the testimony I want to
 
07:18:55.250 --> 07:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
give it I get a little more depth with
 
07:18:57.530 --> 07:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
that in my testimony and if you have any
 
07:18:58.670 --> 07:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
questions I'll be more than happy to
 
07:18:58.680 --> 07:19:00.548 align:start position:0%
questions I'll be more than happy to
answer

07:19:00.548 --> 07:19:00.558 align:start position:0%
answer
 
07:19:13.250 --> 07:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:13.260 --> 07:19:15.708 align:start position:0%
 
which

07:19:15.708 --> 07:19:15.718 align:start position:0%
which
 
07:19:18.410 --> 07:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
tell me another question is how the
 
07:19:20.590 --> 07:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
removal of that particular
 
07:19:22.670 --> 07:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
justification for the use of deadly
 
07:19:22.680 --> 07:19:24.128 align:start position:0%
justification for the use of deadly
force

07:19:24.128 --> 07:19:24.138 align:start position:0%
force
 
07:19:24.138 --> 07:19:25.670 align:start position:0%
force
affects

07:19:25.670 --> 07:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
affects
 
07:19:28.788 --> 07:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
the section section two Roman numeral
 
07:19:32.150 --> 07:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
two where it says reasonably believes
 
07:19:35.448 --> 07:19:35.458 align:start position:0%
that that is a lawful arrest so he's met
 
07:19:37.190 --> 07:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
all the requirements of Roman numeral
 
07:19:37.200 --> 07:19:38.330 align:start position:0%
all the requirements of Roman numeral
two

07:19:38.330 --> 07:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
two
 
07:19:41.750 --> 07:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
then how does this relate to that and in
 
07:19:44.030 --> 07:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
your opinion is that a problem or not it
 
07:19:45.948 --> 07:19:45.958 align:start position:0%
is a problem Robert Newman I appreciate
 
07:19:47.930 --> 07:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
that question uh you kind of triggered
 
07:19:49.250 --> 07:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
my memory something I wanted to mention
 
07:19:49.260 --> 07:19:50.628 align:start position:0%
my memory something I wanted to mention
is

07:19:50.628 --> 07:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:19:53.690 --> 07:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
deadly force the use of deadly force is
 
07:19:56.868 --> 07:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
just a form of an arrest obviously if an
 
07:19:58.490 --> 07:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
officer discharges a firearm at somebody
 
07:20:01.368 --> 07:20:01.378 align:start position:0%
the end result could be death it could
 
07:20:02.690 --> 07:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
be that's the reality if we're using
 
07:20:04.850 --> 07:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
Firearms but our job when we use deadly
 
07:20:06.110 --> 07:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
force is just to stop someone
 
07:20:06.120 --> 07:20:07.490 align:start position:0%
force is just to stop someone
immediately

07:20:07.490 --> 07:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
07:20:09.410 --> 07:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
it's just to infect an arrest that's
 
07:20:12.110 --> 07:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
essentially what deadly force is so when
 
07:20:13.788 --> 07:20:13.798 align:start position:0%
we use deadly force and we're trying to
 
07:20:16.250 --> 07:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
stop someone from either hurting killing
 
07:20:17.930 --> 07:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
someone else or just to affect an arrest
 
07:20:20.090 --> 07:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
that's all the deadly forces for it's to
 
07:20:21.410 --> 07:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
stop someone so if we remove the
 
07:20:21.420 --> 07:20:22.250 align:start position:0%
stop someone so if we remove the
language

07:20:22.250 --> 07:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
language
 
07:20:25.190 --> 07:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
relating deadly force to an arrest
 
07:20:28.070 --> 07:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
it are we're handcuffed literally it's
 
07:20:30.530 --> 07:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
we don't have many parameters that guide
 
07:20:32.930 --> 07:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
us to decide when we can effectively
 
07:20:39.170 --> 07:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:42.530 --> 07:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you so just to clarify do you
 
07:20:45.048 --> 07:20:45.058 align:start position:0%
believe that Roman numeral eight should
 
07:20:49.070 --> 07:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
be removed or should not be removed
 
07:20:51.048 --> 07:20:51.058 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that Roman numeral eight
 
07:20:52.788 --> 07:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
should be repealed thank you say right
 
07:20:59.208 --> 07:20:59.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:02.090 --> 07:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
representative Burke you're recognized
 
07:21:04.010 --> 07:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
07:21:05.150 --> 07:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
07:21:07.788 --> 07:21:07.798 align:start position:0%
um the last speaker brought up the wear
 
07:21:09.948 --> 07:21:09.958 align:start position:0%
incident and I represent Goffstown where
 
07:21:11.930 --> 07:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
and Darren
 
07:21:15.110 --> 07:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
if this bill passed
 
07:21:16.548 --> 07:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
several years ago when the where
 
07:21:19.250 --> 07:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
incident happened
 
07:21:22.730 --> 07:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
would it have a different outcome
 
07:21:25.070 --> 07:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
you know where the AG couldn't find
 
07:21:26.810 --> 07:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
either way
 
07:21:29.270 --> 07:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
or you know the taxpayers didn't have to
 
07:21:32.810 --> 07:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
pay 350 000 excuse me before the witness
 
07:21:35.208 --> 07:21:35.218 align:start position:0%
responds you're asking a police officer
 
07:21:36.230 --> 07:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
to answer on behalf of the Attorney
 
07:21:38.590 --> 07:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
General's office
 
07:21:38.600 --> 07:21:41.170 align:start position:0%
General's office
I

07:21:41.170 --> 07:21:41.180 align:start position:0%
I
 
07:21:44.390 --> 07:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
didn't ask a question from the AG or
 
07:21:46.670 --> 07:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
toward the AG I'm just asking him if
 
07:21:49.128 --> 07:21:49.138 align:start position:0%
this bill of what happened in that
 
07:21:52.310 --> 07:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
situation so I'm laying the the
 
07:21:54.590 --> 07:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
story out I mean I think he understands
 
07:21:56.810 --> 07:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
what happened there I I do apologize I'm
 
07:21:59.030 --> 07:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
not familiar with the rare incident no
 
07:22:00.708 --> 07:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry all right well I was just
 
07:22:03.070 --> 07:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
wondering if there would be a difference
 
07:22:07.788 --> 07:22:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:10.670 --> 07:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
not allowing us to make the decisions we
 
07:22:11.690 --> 07:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
need to make in those stressful
 
07:22:14.330 --> 07:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
situations and that we don't always get
 
07:22:16.010 --> 07:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
it right because we're human
 
07:22:17.690 --> 07:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
but we do the best we can when we train
 
07:22:19.968 --> 07:22:19.978 align:start position:0%
our officers to use the force
 
07:22:23.150 --> 07:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
appropriately and I can tell you that
 
07:22:25.730 --> 07:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
would be an absolutely terrible incident
 
07:22:27.770 --> 07:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
if we have officers shooting people
 
07:22:29.570 --> 07:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
fleeing Walmart just with merchandise
 
07:22:31.968 --> 07:22:31.978 align:start position:0%
that that wouldn't happen in Hudson and
 
07:22:33.350 --> 07:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
I can't see that happening anywhere in
 
07:22:34.610 --> 07:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
this Granite State
 
07:22:36.948 --> 07:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
I I can't speak more about the awareness
 
07:22:38.990 --> 07:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just not that familiar with it all
 
07:22:43.570 --> 07:22:43.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:04.968 --> 07:23:04.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:07.310 --> 07:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
at this time we'll now close the public
 
07:23:07.320 --> 07:23:08.448 align:start position:0%
at this time we'll now close the public
hearing

07:23:08.448 --> 07:23:08.458 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
07:23:08.458 --> 07:23:09.708 align:start position:0%
hearing
on

07:23:09.708 --> 07:23:09.718 align:start position:0%
on
 
07:23:15.350 --> 07:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:17.208 --> 07:23:17.218 align:start position:0%
at this time we will now open the
 
07:23:24.530 --> 07:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:25.788 --> 07:23:25.798 align:start position:0%
representative green you wish to be
 
07:23:30.708 --> 07:23:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:32.448 --> 07:23:32.458 align:start position:0%
a motion to inexperienced legislate
 
07:23:36.128 --> 07:23:36.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:37.850 --> 07:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh and you have
 
07:23:40.368 --> 07:23:40.378 align:start position:0%
seconded the motion uh to inexped into
 
07:23:40.378 --> 07:23:44.030 align:start position:0%
seconded the motion uh to inexped into
legislate

07:23:44.030 --> 07:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:45.468 --> 07:23:45.478 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion
 
07:23:50.150 --> 07:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:55.910 --> 07:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:57.948 --> 07:23:57.958 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes
 
07:24:00.590 --> 07:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
07:24:03.170 --> 07:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
what really stands out to me is when the
 
07:24:06.890 --> 07:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
officer spoke to the terminology being
 
07:24:09.048 --> 07:24:09.058 align:start position:0%
removed where he reasonably believes
 
07:24:11.448 --> 07:24:11.458 align:start position:0%
such force is necessary
 
07:24:15.830 --> 07:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
to the example if the perpetrator has a
 
07:24:17.270 --> 07:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
toy gun
 
07:24:19.490 --> 07:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
um that is really what's resonating with
 
07:24:20.770 --> 07:24:20.780 align:start position:0%
me that
 
07:24:23.090 --> 07:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
this this whole bill I think has to go
 
07:24:25.310 --> 07:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
away but you know removing that language
 
07:24:27.590 --> 07:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
especially is is what really what this
 
07:24:32.390 --> 07:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:34.910 --> 07:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative Roy
 
07:24:38.270 --> 07:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
um I'll be supporting the motion to itl
 
07:24:38.280 --> 07:24:39.288 align:start position:0%
um I'll be supporting the motion to itl
um

07:24:39.288 --> 07:24:39.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:24:42.830 --> 07:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
having having done this this job
 
07:24:45.230 --> 07:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
particularly uh for a few years I had a
 
07:24:46.968 --> 07:24:46.978 align:start position:0%
few occasions myself where I had to draw
 
07:24:49.670 --> 07:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
my firearm and I can tell you no law
 
07:24:51.830 --> 07:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer wants to to draw
 
07:24:54.110 --> 07:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
their firearm no one's excited about it
 
07:24:56.150 --> 07:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
no one's happy about it if you have to
 
07:24:57.770 --> 07:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
discharge your firearm you know right
 
07:24:57.780 --> 07:24:58.910 align:start position:0%
discharge your firearm you know right
away

07:24:58.910 --> 07:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
away
 
07:25:00.770 --> 07:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
um regardless if you're right or wrong
 
07:25:03.288 --> 07:25:03.298 align:start position:0%
you're done working for a while
 
07:25:05.530 --> 07:25:05.540 align:start position:0%
um you're going to be subject to
 
07:25:08.448 --> 07:25:08.458 align:start position:0%
unbelievable scrutiny both by the media
 
07:25:11.990 --> 07:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
and the courts every second that that
 
07:25:14.990 --> 07:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
went by will will be stretched out for
 
07:25:16.968 --> 07:25:16.978 align:start position:0%
hours as people examine it where you
 
07:25:19.850 --> 07:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
only had a second and it has an extreme
 
07:25:22.788 --> 07:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
psychological effect on an officer just
 
07:25:25.010 --> 07:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
having to draw their firearm I could
 
07:25:27.110 --> 07:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
personally recall once
 
07:25:29.090 --> 07:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
um for weeks I had I had nightmares
 
07:25:30.288 --> 07:25:30.298 align:start position:0%
about whether or not I'd be able to
 
07:25:32.628 --> 07:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
squeeze the trigger as much as I wanted
 
07:25:34.490 --> 07:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
to in my dream I just couldn't couldn't
 
07:25:36.530 --> 07:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
make my finger work it's a very
 
07:25:39.048 --> 07:25:39.058 align:start position:0%
traumatic event it's not taken lightly
 
07:25:41.930 --> 07:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
officers trained for unbelievable amount
 
07:25:44.448 --> 07:25:44.458 align:start position:0%
of hours they the the technology they
 
07:25:46.208 --> 07:25:46.218 align:start position:0%
use now and the shoot don't shoot
 
07:25:50.090 --> 07:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
scenarios where they use video and and
 
07:25:52.190 --> 07:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
it's just it's not something taken
 
07:25:54.650 --> 07:25:54.660 align:start position:0%
lightly no one's out there anxious to
 
07:25:56.510 --> 07:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
shoot anybody and it's it's just not
 
07:25:58.788 --> 07:25:58.798 align:start position:0%
happening in the state this this
 
07:26:01.190 --> 07:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable officers standard reuse is
 
07:26:02.690 --> 07:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
the same standard use across the country
 
07:26:05.628 --> 07:26:05.638 align:start position:0%
free and I don't think we need to
 
07:26:07.368 --> 07:26:07.378 align:start position:0%
deviate it based on hypothetical
 
07:26:13.150 --> 07:26:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:15.890 --> 07:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
representative true you recognized
 
07:26:18.110 --> 07:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
07:26:18.120 --> 07:26:20.510 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

07:26:20.510 --> 07:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:22.910 --> 07:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
I have I've heard officers say that in
 
07:26:24.590 --> 07:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
07:26:26.510 --> 07:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
you can't shoot somebody to affect an
 
07:26:26.520 --> 07:26:27.830 align:start position:0%
you can't shoot somebody to affect an
arrest

07:26:27.830 --> 07:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
arrest
 
07:26:29.990 --> 07:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
they don't do it
 
07:26:32.150 --> 07:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
and you can't do it
 
07:26:35.270 --> 07:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:38.270 --> 07:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
and if we take away
 
07:26:38.280 --> 07:26:39.468 align:start position:0%
and if we take away
the right

07:26:39.468 --> 07:26:39.478 align:start position:0%
the right
 
07:26:42.110 --> 07:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
of an officer to do something they never
 
07:26:42.120 --> 07:26:43.610 align:start position:0%
of an officer to do something they never
do

07:26:43.610 --> 07:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
do
 
07:26:46.968 --> 07:26:46.978 align:start position:0%
that's somehow going to affect
 
07:26:50.208 --> 07:26:50.218 align:start position:0%
the Judgment down the road
 
07:26:52.128 --> 07:26:52.138 align:start position:0%
if officers are never going to shoot
 
07:26:55.250 --> 07:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
somebody simply to make an arrest
 
07:26:57.230 --> 07:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
to remove the authority to shoot
 
07:26:59.570 --> 07:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
somebody simply to make an arrest
 
07:27:01.788 --> 07:27:01.798 align:start position:0%
should not be an issue
 
07:27:03.288 --> 07:27:03.298 align:start position:0%
and I believe I'm going to have to
 
07:27:08.990 --> 07:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:12.310 --> 07:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:20.810 --> 07:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:22.850 --> 07:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
I actually agree with my colleague on
 
07:27:25.070 --> 07:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
the other side
 
07:27:25.080 --> 07:27:25.788 align:start position:0%
the other side
um

07:27:25.788 --> 07:27:25.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:27:28.910 --> 07:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
the way I feel about that is that it
 
07:27:30.350 --> 07:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't this we're not just talking
 
07:27:32.650 --> 07:27:32.660 align:start position:0%
about an arrest we're talking about
 
07:27:35.750 --> 07:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
serious arrests we're talking about
 
07:27:35.760 --> 07:27:37.730 align:start position:0%
serious arrests we're talking about
um

07:27:37.730 --> 07:27:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:27:41.090 --> 07:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
what we talked yeah deadly force that's
 
07:27:43.070 --> 07:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here today
 
07:27:47.510 --> 07:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
and so I have to agree that if if that
 
07:27:50.330 --> 07:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
was taken away or this was this bill
 
07:27:53.930 --> 07:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
became law that nothing would really
 
07:27:56.750 --> 07:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
change from what the officer said here
 
07:27:56.760 --> 07:27:57.708 align:start position:0%
change from what the officer said here
today

07:27:57.708 --> 07:27:57.718 align:start position:0%
today
 
07:28:00.590 --> 07:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
so for me
 
07:28:11.390 --> 07:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:14.510 --> 07:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bert you were recognized
 
07:28:16.788 --> 07:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
07:28:19.670 --> 07:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
not sure where I am on this
 
07:28:25.368 --> 07:28:25.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:28.850 --> 07:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:31.788 --> 07:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
you know that young stupid kid that
 
07:28:38.448 --> 07:28:38.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:40.610 --> 07:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend for a moment all
 
07:28:40.620 --> 07:28:42.890 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend for a moment all
right

07:28:42.890 --> 07:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:45.230 --> 07:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
for what
 
07:28:48.650 --> 07:28:48.660 align:start position:0%
it's an issue I'm you would suspend
 
07:28:51.590 --> 07:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
you're referring to someone as stupid
 
07:28:53.868 --> 07:28:53.878 align:start position:0%
and that is highly inappropriate given
 
07:28:55.128 --> 07:28:55.138 align:start position:0%
the situation that you were talking
 
07:28:57.230 --> 07:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
about and referencing you are correct it
 
07:28:58.690 --> 07:28:58.700 align:start position:0%
is also
 
07:28:58.700 --> 07:29:00.230 align:start position:0%
is also
inappropriate

07:29:00.230 --> 07:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
07:29:02.208 --> 07:29:02.218 align:start position:0%
from a matter of that sensitive to just
 
07:29:05.330 --> 07:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
refer to use that type of rhetoric
 
07:29:07.310 --> 07:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
all right please please be careful with
 
07:29:09.770 --> 07:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
the corner so I ask you are correct I
 
07:29:11.690 --> 07:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
didn't mean the kid was stupid this
 
07:29:13.788 --> 07:29:13.798 align:start position:0%
situation was so I do apologize if
 
07:29:15.890 --> 07:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
anybody took that that kid was stupid um
 
07:29:17.750 --> 07:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
so I do apologize for that I could see
 
07:29:19.610 --> 07:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
how you could say that you know that I
 
07:29:22.310 --> 07:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
would you know lean in toward that all
 
07:29:26.030 --> 07:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
right the kid that went to where to sell
 
07:29:30.770 --> 07:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:33.530 --> 07:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
and he stopped
 
07:29:35.810 --> 07:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
from what I understand the policeman
 
07:29:37.548 --> 07:29:37.558 align:start position:0%
came up to him
 
07:29:39.110 --> 07:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
um the kid just didn't like the
 
07:29:40.850 --> 07:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
situation he says you know what I'm out
 
07:29:43.070 --> 07:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
of here and he drove off
 
07:29:45.770 --> 07:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
well he's dead
 
07:29:47.990 --> 07:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if this law would help
 
07:29:49.910 --> 07:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
that case
 
07:29:53.570 --> 07:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
I know the taxpayers paid 350 000 to the
 
07:29:53.580 --> 07:29:55.430 align:start position:0%
I know the taxpayers paid 350 000 to the
father

07:29:55.430 --> 07:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
father
 
07:29:59.030 --> 07:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
um the union leader pounded on the AG to
 
07:30:01.670 --> 07:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
have a resolution to what's going on
 
07:30:04.548 --> 07:30:04.558 align:start position:0%
with this case and where and the AG
 
07:30:06.530 --> 07:30:06.540 align:start position:0%
finally said look we can't decide either
 
07:30:08.690 --> 07:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
way so yeah I don't know either way
 
07:30:11.270 --> 07:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
either because you know I wasn't there
 
07:30:13.730 --> 07:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
but I just wondered if this law would
 
07:30:15.350 --> 07:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
make a difference in that case and
 
07:30:17.510 --> 07:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's all I'm looking at
 
07:30:18.890 --> 07:30:18.900 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't think the police are
 
07:30:20.270 --> 07:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
going to shoot anybody walking out of
 
07:30:22.250 --> 07:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
Walmart you know and I hope people
 
07:30:23.570 --> 07:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
aren't going to run to Walmart tonight
 
07:30:25.610 --> 07:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
and steal
 
07:30:30.048 --> 07:30:30.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:32.628 --> 07:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't know it's just you
 
07:30:35.090 --> 07:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
know we got to do something and what I
 
07:30:37.250 --> 07:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
look at is I introduced a bill for
 
07:30:39.530 --> 07:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
police reform a couple terms ago or last
 
07:30:39.540 --> 07:30:40.610 align:start position:0%
police reform a couple terms ago or last
term

07:30:40.610 --> 07:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
term
 
07:30:42.230 --> 07:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
um I can't remember who the guy that you
 
07:30:43.730 --> 07:30:43.740 align:start position:0%
know the policeman stood on his neck
 
07:30:45.890 --> 07:30:45.900 align:start position:0%
there or kneeled on his neck and died I
 
07:30:48.048 --> 07:30:48.058 align:start position:0%
can't remember his name but
 
07:30:50.690 --> 07:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
in that case everybody said John what
 
07:30:52.070 --> 07:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
are you doing that Bill's going to die
 
07:30:55.190 --> 07:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
well the bill is law now you know
 
07:30:57.288 --> 07:30:57.298 align:start position:0%
because of that one incident so you know
 
07:30:59.570 --> 07:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
I also look at that I say okay if we
 
07:31:00.770 --> 07:31:00.780 align:start position:0%
pass this
 
07:31:04.430 --> 07:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
in the representative that introduced it
 
07:31:08.208 --> 07:31:08.218 align:start position:0%
you know could he stop one you know Bad
 
07:31:11.090 --> 07:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
Apple from acting out and and causing
 
07:31:12.230 --> 07:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
that I don't know
 
07:31:14.150 --> 07:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm just not sure where I'm
 
07:31:15.650 --> 07:31:15.660 align:start position:0%
going to vote on this uh you know I
 
07:31:17.868 --> 07:31:17.878 align:start position:0%
think it can go either way you know I
 
07:31:21.288 --> 07:31:21.298 align:start position:0%
can see both sides thank you
 
07:31:21.298 --> 07:31:22.910 align:start position:0%
can see both sides thank you
clarify

07:31:22.910 --> 07:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
07:31:24.830 --> 07:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
for anyone listening anyone on the
 
07:31:27.350 --> 07:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
committee it's already against the law
 
07:31:30.288 --> 07:31:30.298 align:start position:0%
if you are do the fleeing felon Doctrine
 
07:31:32.570 --> 07:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
was decided by the Supreme Court and I
 
07:31:33.590 --> 07:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
believe in those sometime in the late
 
07:31:35.570 --> 07:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
70s out of the case out of Tennessee
 
07:31:38.208 --> 07:31:38.218 align:start position:0%
if this mere fact that a suspect is
 
07:31:40.490 --> 07:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
fleeing and that alone does not give
 
07:31:43.368 --> 07:31:43.378 align:start position:0%
a police officer the right to shoot that
 
07:31:46.250 --> 07:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
person in the back what we have now RSA
 
07:31:50.030 --> 07:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
625 colon 5. this law was adopted in
 
07:31:52.368 --> 07:31:52.378 align:start position:0%
response to that Supreme Court case
 
07:31:55.128 --> 07:31:55.138 align:start position:0%
if this example about someone fleeing a
 
07:31:56.690 --> 07:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
department store getting shot in the
 
07:32:00.048 --> 07:32:00.058 align:start position:0%
back under the existing law would be
 
07:32:02.628 --> 07:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
illegal it would be an unlawful use of
 
07:32:05.690 --> 07:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
force because it is this I'm going to
 
07:32:07.128 --> 07:32:07.138 align:start position:0%
read them out loud right off the piece
 
07:32:10.128 --> 07:32:10.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:11.750 --> 07:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
you can defend themselves or a third
 
07:32:11.760 --> 07:32:14.448 align:start position:0%
you can defend themselves or a third
person

07:32:14.448 --> 07:32:14.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:16.968 --> 07:32:16.978 align:start position:0%
against the use of deadly force that's
 
07:32:20.810 --> 07:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
one then you go to Roman numeral
 
07:32:24.650 --> 07:32:24.660 align:start position:0%
it's Roman numeral to B1 committed or is
 
07:32:26.570 --> 07:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
committing a felony using force or
 
07:32:27.948 --> 07:32:27.958 align:start position:0%
violence so we're dealing with some type
 
07:32:29.690 --> 07:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
of violent felony this is not when
 
07:32:31.548 --> 07:32:31.558 align:start position:0%
affecting an arrest so the officer is
 
07:32:33.110 --> 07:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
trying to arrest someone they are
 
07:32:35.570 --> 07:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
encountering encountering violent
 
07:32:38.810 --> 07:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
uh violent force in return when they're
 
07:32:40.368 --> 07:32:40.378 align:start position:0%
trying to affect the arrest
 
07:32:42.468 --> 07:32:42.478 align:start position:0%
using a deadly weapon and attempting to
 
07:32:44.150 --> 07:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
escape so now an officer is trying to
 
07:32:46.010 --> 07:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
arrest someone in the suspect is not
 
07:32:48.590 --> 07:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
using a deadly weapon to escape or evade
 
07:32:49.490 --> 07:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
that arrest
 
07:32:52.010 --> 07:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
third case a situation or no fourth
 
07:32:52.968 --> 07:32:52.978 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
07:32:54.948 --> 07:32:54.958 align:start position:0%
the person is likely to seriously
 
07:32:56.930 --> 07:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
endanger human life or inflict seriously
 
07:32:58.910 --> 07:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
body injury unless apprehended without
 
07:33:02.090 --> 07:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
delay that is what the current law
 
07:33:05.150 --> 07:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is on the books so if
 
07:33:07.070 --> 07:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
someone is in a department store and
 
07:33:08.810 --> 07:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
they steals clothes or whatever they're
 
07:33:11.510 --> 07:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
doing and they try to run
 
07:33:13.670 --> 07:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
a police officer is not permitted to
 
07:33:15.170 --> 07:33:15.180 align:start position:0%
just simply shoot that person that is
 
07:33:17.330 --> 07:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
not the law in the state
 
07:33:18.948 --> 07:33:18.958 align:start position:0%
that's not what the laws on the books
 
07:33:21.468 --> 07:33:21.478 align:start position:0%
today that is an incorrect application
 
07:33:23.150 --> 07:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
of this interpretation I'm just
 
07:33:25.610 --> 07:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
clarifying that it doesn't mean that
 
07:33:27.230 --> 07:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
that may not persuade you to go one or
 
07:33:28.968 --> 07:33:28.978 align:start position:0%
another just the application if that
 
07:33:30.170 --> 07:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
were to happen
 
07:33:32.270 --> 07:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
that is that is a crime that officer
 
07:33:34.490 --> 07:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
would that would be investigated I can
 
07:33:36.230 --> 07:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
imagine that officer would be arrested
 
07:33:38.390 --> 07:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
and also they would I can imagine there
 
07:33:40.910 --> 07:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
being a federal civil rights claim as
 
07:33:40.920 --> 07:33:45.590 align:start position:0%
being a federal civil rights claim as
well

07:33:45.590 --> 07:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:47.330 --> 07:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
does anyone wish to speak who has not
 
07:33:54.468 --> 07:33:54.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:00.890 --> 07:34:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:03.350 --> 07:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
but uh can I make a question of the
 
07:34:05.208 --> 07:34:05.218 align:start position:0%
chair just to clarify what you were just
 
07:34:07.430 --> 07:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
reading that is the section of the law
 
07:34:10.548 --> 07:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
it has it starts off with a a
 
07:34:12.650 --> 07:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
requirement that has a colon and then it
 
07:34:14.330 --> 07:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
has three sub paragraphs under
 
07:34:16.190 --> 07:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
underneath that
 
07:34:18.948 --> 07:34:18.958 align:start position:0%
does he have to meet
 
07:34:21.590 --> 07:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
um all three of those or just one of
 
07:34:25.310 --> 07:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
those and if it's just one I I'm re how
 
07:34:28.548 --> 07:34:28.558 align:start position:0%
how do how do you read uh section two
 
07:34:31.070 --> 07:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
the one that says he has made himself
 
07:34:32.990 --> 07:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
known to be an officer
 
07:34:35.390 --> 07:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
that's is that the only requirement that
 
07:34:38.090 --> 07:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:40.910 --> 07:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
so under Roman numeral
 
07:34:44.628 --> 07:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
B1 it lists three circumstances that's
 
07:34:46.788 --> 07:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
correct and you only need it it's any
 
07:34:48.230 --> 07:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
one of those three circumstances you
 
07:34:49.610 --> 07:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
don't need to encounter all three at
 
07:34:51.468 --> 07:34:51.478 align:start position:0%
once so do you have an opinion about
 
07:34:53.810 --> 07:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
section two it just seems as though he
 
07:34:56.330 --> 07:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
just has to make it make known that he's
 
07:34:59.690 --> 07:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:02.570 --> 07:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
it's then after that's under after Roman
 
07:35:05.510 --> 07:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
numeral two B1 is followed by the word
 
07:35:07.670 --> 07:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
and so then they got to satisfy next
 
07:35:09.468 --> 07:35:09.478 align:start position:0%
section okay yes
 
07:35:12.288 --> 07:35:12.298 align:start position:0%
so so one and two go together thank you
 
07:35:16.788 --> 07:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:19.670 --> 07:35:19.680 align:start position:0%

offer an amendment they probably should
 
07:39:18.708 --> 07:39:18.718 align:start position:0%
because I already
 
07:39:20.270 --> 07:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
the chair is a discretion to recognize
 
07:39:22.310 --> 07:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
someone for a motion and that wasn't

Amendment and we'll go from there thank
 
07:41:58.310 --> 07:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman what my Amendment does
 
07:42:00.708 --> 07:42:00.718 align:start position:0%
is if you look at law of the bill look
 
07:42:07.250 --> 07:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:12.288 --> 07:42:12.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:14.570 --> 07:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
yes okay I am sorry
 
07:42:18.048 --> 07:42:18.058 align:start position:0%
all it removes
 
07:42:21.288 --> 07:42:21.298 align:start position:0%
yes it is I'm sorry it removes computer
 
07:42:21.298 --> 07:42:22.670 align:start position:0%
yes it is I'm sorry it removes computer
system

07:42:22.670 --> 07:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
system
 
07:42:26.270 --> 07:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
in the word and that's it three words on
 
07:42:27.948 --> 07:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
each of those lines that's all it
 
07:42:30.170 --> 07:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
removes so that way it clears up what
 
07:42:31.548 --> 07:42:31.558 align:start position:0%
the police are look you know the state
 
07:42:33.770 --> 07:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
police gentleman said
 
07:42:36.110 --> 07:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
you know that what do you mean by
 
07:42:38.810 --> 07:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
computer system so basically what it'll
 
07:42:41.570 --> 07:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
do is it'll remove
 
07:42:45.650 --> 07:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
the name of what is public but not
 
07:42:49.670 --> 07:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
deep down into their system
 
07:42:52.548 --> 07:42:52.558 align:start position:0%
and you know when it comes to upon
 
07:42:52.558 --> 07:42:54.410 align:start position:0%
and you know when it comes to upon
request

07:42:54.410 --> 07:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
request
 
07:42:56.270 --> 07:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
you know I think it's just you know in
 
07:42:59.530 --> 07:42:59.540 align:start position:0%
my eyes upon request is you know written
 
07:43:01.670 --> 07:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
I don't think it has to state that
 
07:43:04.730 --> 07:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
because I don't think in other
 
07:43:04.740 --> 07:43:06.070 align:start position:0%
because I don't think in other
um

07:43:06.070 --> 07:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:43:09.170 --> 07:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
laws it states that it just says upon
 
07:43:12.288 --> 07:43:12.298 align:start position:0%
your request so I think with the very
 
07:43:14.510 --> 07:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
minor changes that I made
 
07:43:16.250 --> 07:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
you know it will stay good with the law
 
07:43:22.730 --> 07:43:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:26.930 --> 07:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:26.940 --> 07:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:43:29.400 --> 07:43:29.410 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:29.410 --> 07:43:34.670 align:start position:0%

07:43:53.750 --> 07:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
if it's verbal if it's online so I would
 
07:43:56.270 --> 07:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
like you to please
 
07:43:59.090 --> 07:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
um itl this amendment so I have made the
 
07:44:00.770 --> 07:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
corrections on my Amendment if you
 
07:44:04.070 --> 07:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
please take a look thank you so much
 
07:44:06.830 --> 07:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
may I respond to that Mr chairman
 
07:44:09.048 --> 07:44:09.058 align:start position:0%
we just we don't itl amendments we just
 
07:44:12.110 --> 07:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
don't we just oppose them okay please
 
07:44:16.310 --> 07:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
oppose this amendment so that a new uh
 
07:44:30.230 --> 07:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:31.788 --> 07:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
07:44:34.670 --> 07:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative you may respond all right
 
07:44:37.850 --> 07:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:40.490 --> 07:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
in the past how I've seen this go
 
07:44:44.090 --> 07:44:44.100 align:start position:0%
is you would support the amendment I put
 
07:44:46.310 --> 07:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
forward and then if there was another
 
07:44:48.708 --> 07:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
amendment brought forward and accepted
 
07:44:51.410 --> 07:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
that would override my Amendment
 
07:44:54.170 --> 07:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
but at least past mine and the reason is
 
07:44:56.510 --> 07:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
you want to remove the computer system
 
07:44:58.990 --> 07:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
in the word and out of there
 
07:45:00.890 --> 07:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what's going to happen
 
07:45:02.448 --> 07:45:02.458 align:start position:0%
if there is another amendment brought
 
07:45:04.788 --> 07:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
forward but I also understand
 
07:45:09.530 --> 07:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
when I looked into it upon request
 
07:45:11.288 --> 07:45:11.298 align:start position:0%
you know it doesn't have to specify
 
07:45:15.170 --> 07:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
written verbal or anything else because
 
07:45:17.270 --> 07:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
if I was going to request anything of
 
07:45:19.250 --> 07:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
course it would be in writing you know
 
07:45:20.810 --> 07:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to state that and and
 
07:45:23.150 --> 07:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
the police are going to accept any
 
07:45:23.160 --> 07:45:26.208 align:start position:0%
the police are going to accept any
request

07:45:26.208 --> 07:45:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:28.250 --> 07:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
it's only smart to put it in right in
 
07:45:31.490 --> 07:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't have to specify that so
 
07:45:33.350 --> 07:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
please support my
 
07:45:36.708 --> 07:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
you know six words being removed three
 
07:45:40.850 --> 07:45:40.860 align:start position:0%
on each line of 11 and 23 and then if
 
07:45:42.288 --> 07:45:42.298 align:start position:0%
there's another amendment we can talk
 
07:45:44.448 --> 07:45:44.458 align:start position:0%
about that and if that's adopted
 
07:45:47.330 --> 07:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
you know that's fine with me also once I
 
07:45:50.330 --> 07:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
look at it thank you
 
07:45:52.910 --> 07:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
you have to be recognized you don't need
 
07:45:57.010 --> 07:45:57.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:58.548 --> 07:45:58.558 align:start position:0%
representative Testament you're
 
07:46:02.570 --> 07:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
recognized uh I have a problem
 
07:46:06.110 --> 07:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
with an amendment if it tries to slip in
 
07:46:08.868 --> 07:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
another subject altogether and the
 
07:46:11.230 --> 07:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
second amendment that it was offered
 
07:46:13.788 --> 07:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
talks about nobody there's been no
 
07:46:16.610 --> 07:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment offered at this time
 
07:46:19.968 --> 07:46:19.978 align:start position:0%
and and we can we're right now the
 
07:46:21.948 --> 07:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
question is on
 
07:46:26.170 --> 07:46:26.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:28.730 --> 07:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
2022-0110h that is the question
 
07:46:30.650 --> 07:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
so the other Amendment may have some
 
07:46:32.750 --> 07:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
good it may have some whatever we are
 
07:46:34.670 --> 07:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
not that is not the question that is for
 
07:46:37.968 --> 07:46:37.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:40.190 --> 07:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
07:46:41.810 --> 07:46:41.820 align:start position:0%
Eric getting ready to vote on an
 
07:46:45.230 --> 07:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
amendment one way or the other and you
 
07:46:47.330 --> 07:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
know some of them are thinking
 
07:46:49.250 --> 07:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
there's another amendment out there it
 
07:46:52.128 --> 07:46:52.138 align:start position:0%
just makes a few tweaks and we need to
 
07:46:54.708 --> 07:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
understand that it has been grossly
 
07:46:54.718 --> 07:46:58.430 align:start position:0%
understand that it has been grossly
changed

07:46:58.430 --> 07:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:01.788 --> 07:47:01.798 align:start position:0%
we we can discuss that but the potential
 
07:47:04.850 --> 07:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
of the other Amendment at the time this
 
07:47:06.890 --> 07:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
question has been moved after this
 
07:47:09.170 --> 07:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
question is moved so I can see my point
 
07:47:10.430 --> 07:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
no I get the point that you're making
 
07:47:12.110 --> 07:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
some you don't want people to vote
 
07:47:13.788 --> 07:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
against one Amendment and hopes the
 
07:47:17.208 --> 07:47:17.218 align:start position:0%
other I I to be honest and this
 
07:47:19.128 --> 07:47:19.138 align:start position:0%
amendment has basically another bill we
 
07:47:21.170 --> 07:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
had last year that didn't make it out of
 
07:47:22.850 --> 07:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
it never made it to someone's desk for
 
07:47:25.070 --> 07:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
Signature so I all I will tell you is
 
07:47:27.650 --> 07:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
putting that onto this you may run into
 
07:47:29.570 --> 07:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
some trouble somewhere else that's my
 
07:47:30.708 --> 07:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
opinion that's all we're going to talk
 
07:47:32.390 --> 07:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
about now so that's what we're going to
 
07:47:33.770 --> 07:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
do representative Roy you are not
 
07:47:35.810 --> 07:47:35.820 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you
 
07:47:35.820 --> 07:47:36.468 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you
um

07:47:36.468 --> 07:47:36.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:47:38.750 --> 07:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to speak to the amendment but
 
07:47:41.570 --> 07:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
it in in effect the overall bill because
 
07:47:45.110 --> 07:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
it is the amendment I I think we it do
 
07:47:47.090 --> 07:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
us well to do a little history
 
07:47:49.788 --> 07:47:49.798 align:start position:0%
um quickly where do blood reports come
 
07:47:52.310 --> 07:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
from this is a this is a civil rights
 
07:47:56.090 --> 07:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
issue the police back in in in the day
 
07:47:59.150 --> 07:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
people would go missing and they'd go
 
07:48:00.890 --> 07:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
missing in the middle of the night and
 
07:48:02.448 --> 07:48:02.458 align:start position:0%
nobody knew where they went and
 
07:48:04.310 --> 07:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes they would be because the
 
07:48:06.890 --> 07:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
police took them as a result of that we
 
07:48:09.410 --> 07:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
made laws to make the police every
 
07:48:11.090 --> 07:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
morning they would update who was
 
07:48:12.530 --> 07:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
arrested and taken into custody
 
07:48:15.230 --> 07:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
overnight this was to keep them honest
 
07:48:17.690 --> 07:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
and so that we knew their activities
 
07:48:17.700 --> 07:48:18.890 align:start position:0%
and so that we knew their activities
so

07:48:18.890 --> 07:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:48:20.810 --> 07:48:20.820 align:start position:0%
having that in mind
 
07:48:24.350 --> 07:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
now we've come to the Future and now
 
07:48:26.090 --> 07:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
well we don't really like that so much
 
07:48:27.410 --> 07:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
because it's embarrassing for some
 
07:48:30.708 --> 07:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
people and it's possibly it is but I
 
07:48:31.968 --> 07:48:31.978 align:start position:0%
just want you to everyone understand
 
07:48:33.708 --> 07:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
what we're what we're talking about
 
07:48:36.468 --> 07:48:36.478 align:start position:0%
pulling back from was
 
07:48:38.448 --> 07:48:38.458 align:start position:0%
um the fact that the police were able to
 
07:48:40.190 --> 07:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
take someone and disappear them in the
 
07:48:41.868 --> 07:48:41.878 align:start position:0%
middle of the night without any record
 
07:48:43.968 --> 07:48:43.978 align:start position:0%
of where they went and who they are
 
07:48:47.270 --> 07:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
so it this is a historical record this
 
07:48:49.730 --> 07:48:49.740 align:start position:0%
person was arrested good bad and
 
07:48:52.190 --> 07:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
different it happened they were arrested
 
07:48:54.048 --> 07:48:54.058 align:start position:0%
it used to be not too long ago that it
 
07:48:55.548 --> 07:48:55.558 align:start position:0%
would be in the newspaper it wasn't on
 
07:48:56.690 --> 07:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
the internet because there was no
 
07:48:59.330 --> 07:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
internet so every day if you recall once
 
07:49:01.310 --> 07:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
most of us when there was a newspaper in
 
07:49:02.570 --> 07:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
the morning you'd look at the blog and
 
07:49:04.430 --> 07:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
see you got picked up last night
 
07:49:07.730 --> 07:49:07.740 align:start position:0%
so now it's on the internet which unlike
 
07:49:10.250 --> 07:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
a newspaper is forever so perhaps we do
 
07:49:11.930 --> 07:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
need to look at the technological aspect
 
07:49:13.968 --> 07:49:13.978 align:start position:0%
of this but we need to keep in mind why
 
07:49:15.708 --> 07:49:15.718 align:start position:0%
we did this in the first place and why
 
07:49:18.590 --> 07:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:20.868 --> 07:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
thank you and I think the other concern
 
07:49:22.190 --> 07:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
is just
 
07:49:23.930 --> 07:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
is once it's on the Internet it's it's
 
07:49:26.208 --> 07:49:26.218 align:start position:0%
on there and even if the state police
 
07:49:28.730 --> 07:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
take it down or change your website it
 
07:49:30.590 --> 07:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
may be
 
07:49:33.288 --> 07:49:33.298 align:start position:0%
on other websites and and that this any
 
07:49:35.030 --> 07:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
other third-party website that's not in
 
07:49:36.468 --> 07:49:36.478 align:start position:0%
control of the state the state is not
 
07:49:38.570 --> 07:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
under any won't be able to have any
 
07:49:41.208 --> 07:49:41.218 align:start position:0%
obligation to do anything about that
 
07:49:43.128 --> 07:49:43.138 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
07:49:45.830 --> 07:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
must have a response to our question or
 
07:49:48.110 --> 07:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
clarification for representative Roy's
 
07:49:48.120 --> 07:49:49.368 align:start position:0%
clarification for representative Roy's
comment

07:49:49.368 --> 07:49:49.378 align:start position:0%
comment
 
07:49:51.288 --> 07:49:51.298 align:start position:0%
and it would seem to me that a person
 
07:49:52.610 --> 07:49:52.620 align:start position:0%
who disappears in the middle of the
 
07:49:55.070 --> 07:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
night has not been arrested so I'm I'm
 
07:49:57.110 --> 07:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
not sure I can make the link
 
07:49:58.850 --> 07:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
maybe they arrested him and did did
 
07:50:01.250 --> 07:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
something nefarious with them but there
 
07:50:02.510 --> 07:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a record of his being
 
07:50:05.388 --> 07:50:05.398 align:start position:0%
arrested at all I would I would think if
 
07:50:08.330 --> 07:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
I could respond that's just the point
 
07:50:10.430 --> 07:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
there would be no record they would they
 
07:50:12.410 --> 07:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
would scoop somebody up well now they're
 
07:50:14.208 --> 07:50:14.218 align:start position:0%
required to to make a record of everyone
 
07:50:16.368 --> 07:50:16.378 align:start position:0%
they arrest and the public are able to
 
07:50:18.830 --> 07:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
look at it and actually in some states
 
07:50:21.708 --> 07:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it's this stapa if a
 
07:50:23.330 --> 07:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
member of the public comes into the desk
 
07:50:24.888 --> 07:50:24.898 align:start position:0%
of the police department says I'd like
 
07:50:26.628 --> 07:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
to see the blotter they have to produce
 
07:50:30.288 --> 07:50:30.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:32.448 --> 07:50:32.458 align:start position:0%
representative Platt
 
07:50:35.628 --> 07:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
I understand Representatives Roy's point
 
07:50:37.850 --> 07:50:37.860 align:start position:0%
but nothing's changed and that there
 
07:50:39.770 --> 07:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
will still be an arrest record it will
 
07:50:41.750 --> 07:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
be permanent and the only thing that
 
07:50:43.910 --> 07:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
will be changed after the fact upon
 
07:50:47.690 --> 07:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
request is a public facing website but
 
07:50:49.430 --> 07:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
the police still have the record and
 
07:50:51.410 --> 07:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
it's going to it's going to appear in
 
07:50:53.330 --> 07:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
the website at first and only be removed
 
07:50:58.490 --> 07:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:00.350 --> 07:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative Conley
 
07:51:02.150 --> 07:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
07:51:03.708 --> 07:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
um I have concerns about the underlying
 
07:51:07.010 --> 07:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
Bill and won't support it as is but um
 
07:51:09.288 --> 07:51:09.298 align:start position:0%
with the amendment and as I mentioned
 
07:51:10.810 --> 07:51:10.820 align:start position:0%
earlier having dealt with this subject
 
07:51:14.468 --> 07:51:14.478 align:start position:0%
very often back in the newspaper days
 
07:51:17.090 --> 07:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
the best or perhaps a better way to
 
07:51:19.430 --> 07:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
resolve this might be to do an addendum
 
07:51:22.610 --> 07:51:22.620 align:start position:0%
that does not change the public record
 
07:51:22.620 --> 07:51:23.270 align:start position:0%
that does not change the public record
um

07:51:23.270 --> 07:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:51:25.788 --> 07:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
but clarifies the result of the case but
 
07:51:28.070 --> 07:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
further having again dealt with that on
 
07:51:29.690 --> 07:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
a fairly regular basis when someone
 
07:51:32.750 --> 07:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
would call out of the blue and make
 
07:51:35.090 --> 07:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
start making demands of information
 
07:51:38.090 --> 07:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
being removed in an identical situation
 
07:51:41.750 --> 07:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
we would say Okay show us some proof of
 
07:51:43.010 --> 07:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
this and there's nothing in this
 
07:51:44.750 --> 07:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that requires that they
 
07:51:46.490 --> 07:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
demonstrate this and of course this
 
07:51:48.010 --> 07:51:48.020 align:start position:0%
information is available
 
07:51:50.570 --> 07:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
but it's without that being clearly
 
07:51:53.388 --> 07:51:53.398 align:start position:0%
specified it's going to create a whole
 
07:51:55.128 --> 07:51:55.138 align:start position:0%
mess of problems for whoever has to take
 
07:51:59.868 --> 07:51:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:59.878 --> 07:52:03.128 align:start position:0%
 
oh

07:52:03.128 --> 07:52:03.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:07.250 --> 07:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:10.190 --> 07:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
on uh you suggested that um it went
 
07:52:11.930 --> 07:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
nowhere the other one I'd like to speak
 
07:52:13.788 --> 07:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
to that if I may
 
07:52:17.150 --> 07:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
um the what is in the other bill was
 
07:52:19.670 --> 07:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
actually co-sponsored by representative
 
07:52:22.010 --> 07:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
Troy and you introduced it to the Senate
 
07:52:24.610 --> 07:52:24.620 align:start position:0%
and it unanimously passed this chamber
 
07:52:28.430 --> 07:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
and it was on consent calendar I spoke
 
07:52:32.750 --> 07:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
with the prime sponsor who agreed and
 
07:52:34.548 --> 07:52:34.558 align:start position:0%
wanted me to do this for our city of
 
07:52:36.948 --> 07:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
Manchester and the entire State and I
 
07:52:39.410 --> 07:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
hope that you'll can you'll consider
 
07:52:43.310 --> 07:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
that that this bipartisan effort of two
 
07:52:47.628 --> 07:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
Representatives met and discussed how to
 
07:52:50.448 --> 07:52:50.458 align:start position:0%
fix this bill and we had already agreed
 
07:52:53.150 --> 07:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
on something similar before
 
07:52:55.670 --> 07:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
so with all due respect chairman when
 
07:52:57.170 --> 07:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
you say it went to somebody's desk and
 
07:53:00.830 --> 07:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:03.170 --> 07:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
I will clarify my comments it
 
07:53:06.830 --> 07:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
that bill never passed in the other body
 
07:53:09.170 --> 07:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
from what that I'm aware of
 
07:53:10.670 --> 07:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
and then they're talking about the post
 
07:53:12.590 --> 07:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
arrest photos which I went to the other
 
07:53:15.530 --> 07:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
well I was on on a computer testifying
 
07:53:17.388 --> 07:53:17.398 align:start position:0%
but I testified in front of the other
 
07:53:19.548 --> 07:53:19.558 align:start position:0%
body in support of the bill that you
 
07:53:20.810 --> 07:53:20.820 align:start position:0%
were the prime sponsor of Representative
 
07:53:23.270 --> 07:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
Klein Knight I'm just what I was
 
07:53:25.968 --> 07:53:25.978 align:start position:0%
cautioning was by taking the spirit of
 
07:53:27.590 --> 07:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
that bill and putting it into this
 
07:53:30.110 --> 07:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
amendment if that
 
07:53:32.030 --> 07:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
if your other Bill did not make it out
 
07:53:34.548 --> 07:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
of that body this whole if you support
 
07:53:36.708 --> 07:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
the policy may not be wise to put them
 
07:53:38.810 --> 07:53:38.820 align:start position:0%
together well it's just a suggestion can
 
07:53:40.128 --> 07:53:40.138 align:start position:0%
I speak to that
 
07:53:42.830 --> 07:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor himself
 
07:53:45.650 --> 07:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
noticed both of our intentions were
 
07:53:48.350 --> 07:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
exactly the same because this is causing
 
07:53:50.750 --> 07:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of public distress with pictures
 
07:53:53.150 --> 07:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
and your name being up there and you're
 
07:53:56.330 --> 07:53:56.340 align:start position:0%
innocent you can't get an apartment your
 
07:53:58.788 --> 07:53:58.798 align:start position:0%
kids can't go to a certain school you
 
07:54:01.070 --> 07:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
can't get the job I mean it's up there
 
07:54:03.830 --> 07:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
forever and
 
07:54:06.288 --> 07:54:06.298 align:start position:0%
we have the same intent for our people
 
07:54:10.730 --> 07:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
in this bipartisan Manner and we need to
 
07:54:14.208 --> 07:54:14.218 align:start position:0%
take this step and I I believe respect
 
07:54:17.330 --> 07:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
for Prime sponsors wishes too and feel
 
07:54:19.968 --> 07:54:19.978 align:start position:0%
free to reach out to representative
 
07:54:24.948 --> 07:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
infantine about this but this is this is
 
07:54:31.690 --> 07:54:31.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:39.048 --> 07:54:39.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:42.530 --> 07:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
zero one one zero I think it's very
 
07:54:44.930 --> 07:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
important that we removed the computer
 
07:54:48.110 --> 07:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
system reference from the original bill
 
07:54:51.230 --> 07:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
because it's the computer system that
 
07:54:55.368 --> 07:54:55.378 align:start position:0%
holds the historical record that's where
 
07:54:59.208 --> 07:54:59.218 align:start position:0%
the official record remains I also like
 
07:55:02.208 --> 07:55:02.218 align:start position:0%
this bill because it doesn't start going
 
07:55:04.910 --> 07:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
it just says upon request there's no
 
07:55:06.590 --> 07:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
penalty of course if you have to call
 
07:55:08.868 --> 07:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
the State Police twice or if you have to
 
07:55:11.628 --> 07:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
send two letters I think just keep it as
 
07:55:13.730 --> 07:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
simple as possible I don't see why the
 
07:55:16.190 --> 07:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
state police would object to removing
 
07:55:18.708 --> 07:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
something once they see that it's been
 
07:55:20.690 --> 07:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
the case has been demised or wasn't
 
07:55:22.968 --> 07:55:22.978 align:start position:0%
dismissed or wasn't processed at all so
 
07:55:26.868 --> 07:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
I I support the the amendment uh zero
 
07:55:32.590 --> 07:55:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:39.110 --> 07:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:42.548 --> 07:55:42.558 align:start position:0%
um I agree with representative Conley
 
07:55:47.150 --> 07:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill is has no purpose it
 
07:55:50.090 --> 07:55:50.100 align:start position:0%
will not do anything
 
07:55:53.570 --> 07:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
uh who was explained that the blotter is
 
07:55:56.868 --> 07:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
a PDF that is sent out on a weekly basis
 
07:55:56.878 --> 07:55:58.548 align:start position:0%
a PDF that is sent out on a weekly basis
uh

07:55:58.548 --> 07:55:58.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:56:02.628 --> 07:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
that plot exists forever
 
07:56:06.948 --> 07:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
an additional removal from the computer
 
07:56:11.810 --> 07:56:11.820 align:start position:0%
database will make no change that PDF
 
07:56:17.150 --> 07:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
that PDF is for one week the next a week
 
07:56:19.310 --> 07:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
will have a different blotter that name
 
07:56:21.230 --> 07:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
will not be on that blotter unless
 
07:56:23.448 --> 07:56:23.458 align:start position:0%
they've done something else
 
07:56:26.690 --> 07:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
I think that we are wasting time here I
 
07:56:29.388 --> 07:56:29.398 align:start position:0%
think we are to forget about amendments
 
07:56:40.270 --> 07:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:46.788 --> 07:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:49.730 --> 07:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
incur with my learned appointed across
 
07:56:52.788 --> 07:56:52.798 align:start position:0%

07:57:04.490 --> 07:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:07.128 --> 07:57:07.138 align:start position:0%
has anyone wish to speak was not spoken
 
07:57:07.138 --> 07:57:11.330 align:start position:0%
has anyone wish to speak was not spoken
already

07:57:11.330 --> 07:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:12.530 --> 07:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
all right
 
07:57:15.110 --> 07:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
