at the
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
DMV um I also was looking at the fiscal
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
note that was prepared um I did want to
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
just add a few things um this bill um
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
that is being proposed allows for rental
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
companies applying to register a
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
passenger vehicle um as a fleet in New
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently the international
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
registration program does allow for this
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
um it's on page 48 of our International
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
registration plan um so we already have
 
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.310 align:start position:0%
registration plan um so we already have
this

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
capability um and therefore um we would
 
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.110 align:start position:0%
capability um and therefore um we would
not

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
need the um proposed additional Staffing
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's on the fiscal note because this
 
00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:52.519 align:start position:0%
is something that we already
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
offer I'm happy to take any
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the committee
 
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you Mr chairman
 
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
uh if we already offer it what does this
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
bill change to
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
enable I don't think
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
anything okay thank you you're welcome
 
00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the
 
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill thank you
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
question um we have had conversations
 
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
about this I believe
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
um can
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
does does the legislation change
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
anything as far as um the locality of
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
where the
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
registrations are to be
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
done uh no according to the IRP plan
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
they can use New Hampshire as their
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
based jurisdiction if they so choose um
 
00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:51.759 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't impact where a rental
 
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
company could set up their Fleet they
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
just have to meet the requirements of
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
the IRP plan which means they have a
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire um and they
 
00:14:03.749 --> 00:14:03.759 align:start position:0%
store primarily their Fleet in New
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um all of the criteria that
 
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
it U oh sorry about that follow up quick
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
necessary for um
 
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
implementation of this
 
00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:32.519 align:start position:0%
um as envisioned by the prime sponsor if
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
he were here um that we don't already
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
have a policy or procedure to
 
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
accomplish so the option is available um
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
I think we would just need one of the
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
larger rental vehicle passenger vehicle
 
00:14:50.749 --> 00:14:50.759 align:start position:0%
rental companies to reach out um we
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
would have to figure out how to um
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
assist them in tracking their their
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
mileage and making sure that they're
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
state another followup rep thank you um
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
how about the um the stickers um how
 
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
would they on
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
on on these rental fleets that um I've
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
I've heard anecdotally in the past that
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult where they would
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
have to track where those vehicles are
 
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
that had been registered here um so how
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
would that be envisioned or how is that
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
currently handled So currently every
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
year they would need to um re renew
 
00:15:40.749 --> 00:15:40.759 align:start position:0%
their registrations and put those
 
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
stickers on the plates that coincide
 
00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
with that car so they would need to find
 
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
that car somewhere so it could be out in
 
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:49.959 align:start position:0%
Colorado um but it's registered in New
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they need to put the decal
 
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
car sure anybody else from the committee
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
I know good now anybody else from the
 
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
committee okay thank you Mr chair and
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um with
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
the IRP
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
document um does it get into specific
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
guidelines like the rest of this bill
 
00:16:14.829 --> 00:16:14.839 align:start position:0%
does in terms of the calculation for the
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
um um registrations or um specifying
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
that they must operate the rental
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle here um does it get that
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
specific no the IRP plan's more of
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
General guidelines um and then we
 
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
adopted it as rule so um it's kind of I
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if rental car
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
companies can already register their
 
00:16:52.309 --> 00:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
vehicles in New
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh businesses cost conscious
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
always looking to save money does
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
registering their vehicles in New
 
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire give them any type of a cost
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
Advantage as opposed to register them
 
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
where they do
 
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.750 align:start position:0%
where they do
now

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
um I don't see one um only because a
 
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
passenger vehicle
 
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.270 align:start position:0%
passenger vehicle
registration

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
um it's it's going to charge them the
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
same as if they an a portioned vehicle
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
registration the difference with the a
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
portion vehicle registration is we track
 
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
it in the system and then pay fuel tax
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
to all of the uh states that they
 
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
traveled into so um it makes it easier
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
for businesses that are doing business
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
in our state um to not have to get trip
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
tickets you can only get like three trip
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
tickets over a certain period of time um
 
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
so this just makes that easier but I'm
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
not sure about the rental cars what
 
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
the but again I don't know what the um
 
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
what the benefit would be for them I
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
you anybody else from the committee
 
00:18:01.149 --> 00:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
repres gki thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question is
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
there a certain amount of time that um a
 
00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle has to be in New Hampshire if
 
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's registered by these rental
 
00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
companies uh no they actually only need
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
like one mile in New Hampshire so long
 
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
as they get at least one mile in the
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
state that they're registered yes thank
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome anybody else I have
 
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
one uh because it just came to uh to to
 
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
to me a couple of days ago I don't know
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
if you know the answer to this are the
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
rental companies actually seeking States
 
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
for their whole fleets or do they prefer
 
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
to have a portion of their Fleet in
 
00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
every state they actually do business in
 
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
because of the different
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
laws I don't know that one sorry anybody
 
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
else representative Hill um inspections
 
00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
can you speak to inspections of these
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
rental fleets So currently the
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
inspections would be the same um as all
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
of the other vehicles in New Hampshire
 
00:18:59.710 --> 00:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
annually um so they would still require
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
those inspections safety
 
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
inspections follow follow up
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
um what would what would it obviously
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mean that someone that has
 
00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
their uh that vehicle then in Colorado
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
has to come running back um once a year
 
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
to do it what what happens in that
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
situation with where the vehicle is out
 
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
of state I believe to drive in New
 
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they would have to have that
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state inspection
 
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
hampire then they probably would not
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
have an IRP
 
00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
account not us as a base jurisdiction I
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
should clarify that yeah anybody else
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
you next up chair recognizes Bob Skully
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
Association no position on the bill good
 
00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
morning Mr scy morning Mr chairman
 
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee it's a pleasure
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
to be here today to speak on House Bill
 
00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
119 FN um like the previous speaker said
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
um we're not taking a position but we
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
don't feel this bill is needed you can
 
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
already do what this bill's looking to
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
do in New Hampshire but I do want to
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit to the truck side so
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
if you go down to on
 
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
page one down on line 26 when it refers
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
to a rental company that owns trucks
 
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
registered 26,000 or less so that's a
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
commercial motor vehicle by definition
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
if it's over 10,000 10,000 one and up we
 
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:44.990 align:start position:0%
if it's over 10,000 10,000 one and up we
have

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
RP so a trucking company if they have a
 
00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
physical exposure in any state multiple
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
States they can choose which state to
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
register that vehicle so um did a
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
question representative Hamlin excuse me
 
00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:02.919 align:start position:0%
asked there's a disadvantage for
 
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
truckers to register in the state of New
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if they have other states and
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's because of the property tax that
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
you have so I will give an example um
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
very large rental Fleet registered all
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
their equipment in the city of
 
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester a long time ago I went down
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
with the representative to try to see if
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
there's something we could do to help
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
them out with the cost because it was
 
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
excessive um there was no ability to do
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
that and moved all the equipment for all
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
of New England to Kingsboro
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and so the city of
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester lost all the revenue um I
 
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
understand that municipalities is their
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
second largest source of income there's
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
been multiple attempts to try to change
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
that since I've been here none initiated
 
00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
by me they've all failed miserably um
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
once the local communities get involved
 
00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039 align:start position:0%
up here but that is why on the truck
 
00:21:58.269 --> 00:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
side anyways if they have an option you
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
know it's cheaper for them to register
 
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
them in Indiana and they have a physical
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
base there they could register I just
 
00:22:06.669 --> 00:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
picked that state randomly they could
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
register all their equipment there um if
 
00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:11.919 align:start position:0%
they have a physical being there um if
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the only place that
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
they're based physically then that's
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
where they have to register their
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
equipment if it's a truck but that would
 
00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
be I did not speak to the prime sponsor
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
but I would think maybe that was some of
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
the motive to try to generate Revenue
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
but I don't know that for sure but I
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
just wanted to share that with you on
 
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:33.559 align:start position:0%
the truck side um uh but there's nothing
 
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
in this bill here that you can't
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
currently do today from our
 
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:40.760 align:start position:0%

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
to present uh House Bill 612 this bill
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
addresses an important but often
 
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
overlooked issue for youth operators
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
transitioning to adult licenses it
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
offers a practical solution and saves
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
time and reduces unnecessary hassle for
 
00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
both drivers and
 
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
DMP under current law youth operators
 
00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
face unnecessary challenges When
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
approaching the 21st birthday
 
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
particularly if their birthday falls in
 
00:26:56.669 --> 00:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
a weekend holiday or if they prefer to
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
renew online
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh the process is that if their birthday
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
falls in a weekday it's not a problem
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
they can visit the DMV on that day and
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
receive the standard horizontal license
 
00:27:08.389 --> 00:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
however if their birthday falls on a
 
00:27:10.389 --> 00:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
weekend or a holiday they must renew
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
before their birthday in which case they
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
will receive a vertical youth operator's
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
license many drivers who don't want to
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
have a youth operator's license for
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
another five years must then return to
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
the DMP after their birthday to obtain
 
00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
the horizontal license which will then
 
00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
be marked as a
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
duplicate for those who wait until after
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
their birthday their license becomes
 
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.909 align:start position:0%
their birthday their license becomes
technically

00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
technically
 
00:27:33.789 --> 00:27:33.799 align:start position:0%
invalid this can be particularly
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
challenging for those who are away at
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
school as ret turning home at the right
 
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
time may not be feasible these drivers
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
are left without the ability to drive or
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
are forced to risk driving on an expired
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
license youth operators who wish to
 
00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
renew online and receive a horizontal
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
license must also wait until their 21st
 
00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:52.519 align:start position:0%
birthday to do so if they renew even one
 
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
day early they receive a vertical
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
license and face the same inconvenience
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
of returning to the DMV later
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
additionally renewing online involves a
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
waiting period while the license is
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
printed and mailed leaving drivers
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
without any legal proof of renewal
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
during that
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
time this inefficient process wastes
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
time for drivers and increases the
 
00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
workload for the
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
DMV HB 612 provides a simple and
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
practical solution that allows youth
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
operators to submit their renewal
 
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
application up to 30 days before their
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
21st birthday and receive a temporary
 
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
license valid for driving
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
purposes this temporary license ensures
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
they can transition seamlessly to the
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
standard horizontal license on or
 
00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
shortly after their birthday regardless
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
of whether the birthday falls in a
 
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.430 align:start position:0%
of whether the birthday falls in a
weekend

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
holiday um why this matters first it
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
eliminates unnecessary trips DMV drivers
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
can submit their application once and
 
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
receive the license they prefer saving
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
time and
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
frustration it reduces the burden on DMV
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
staff by cutting down the duplicate
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
license requests making operations more
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
efficient it's cost it's a cost-
 
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
effective solution a one-time system
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
update costing 48,000 will streamline
 
00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
the process for years to come this bills
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
brings flexibility and modernization to
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's licensing process it
 
00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:06.519 align:start position:0%
reflects the realities of how people use
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
and prefer their licenses while aligning
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
the system with the needs of today's
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
drivers I urge the committee to support
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
HB 612 and I'd be happy to answer any
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your
 
00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
time thank you so much any questions
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
gon I I do have one question uh thank
 
00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.389 align:start position:0%
gon I I do have one question uh thank
you

00:29:29.389 --> 00:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative this might be better for
 
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
the director of the DMV but um is this
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
an easier process than extending the
 
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
birthday yeah it
 
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
it might be better for the director but
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
it it it spreads out the workload on the
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I would defer to the DMD on that
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
one they probably have a better answer
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
than I
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
would any other questions from the
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
sir chair now would like to recognize uh
 
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%

committee thank you so much for the
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity speak this morning uh as you
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
said Mr chair uh we at the DMV 100%
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
support this bill I want to thank
 
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
representative V uh for at the end of
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
the last session um highlighting this
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
and and bringing it to my attention that
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
he'd like to Champion this change I can
 
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
tell you that in my three years in the
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
position as the MV director I have had
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
more parents young people in the
 
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
community come up to me and say um why
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
do I receive the vertical license in the
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
mail uh after I've turned 21 I thought I
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
was doing everything right because the
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
renewal notice goes out and it lets
 
00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
people know we encourage you to renew
 
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
early well if you renew early online um
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
what people didn't know and it's because
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the way the system was configured uh
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
they're renewing a youth operator and so
 
00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
when they would get their license in the
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
mail it would be the vertical youth
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
operator license again this has been
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
going on for 15 years they would have to
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
come into the DMV and then pay $10 for a
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
duplicate um and take an updated photo
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
and then receive their horizontal
 
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
license that they're entitled to because
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
they turned 21 um so I love this bill
 
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
because this bill gives an opportunity
 
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
for uh that 30 days in advance um to
 
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
representative A's point it spreads out
 
00:31:42.629 --> 00:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
the volume 30 days in advance you can go
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
online you can renew your driver's
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
license you can get the receipt that you
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
renewed you can use your currently uh
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
valid youth operator license that if you
 
00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
had to show both you could and then
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to do the
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
$48,000 system change so that when you
 
00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:00.039 align:start position:0%
ear 21 in the system that's it's going
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
to trigger us to mail you the horizontal
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
license that shows that you're over 21
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
and while that's in transit you still
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
have your youth operator license for the
 
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
30 days past that date with the receipt
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
until you get your hard copy in the mail
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
and uh currently we're delivering
 
00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:18.519 align:start position:0%
licenses we're printing licenses same
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
day or next day uh generally speaking so
 
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
we're confident we'll we'll be able to
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
fulfill that 30-day window but um this
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
is a uh this is a big issue and you hear
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
it from a lot of people in the community
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
to include if you want to go into the
 
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
DMV like the representative said and
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's a weekend or it's a holiday and
 
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
that happens to be your 21st birthday
 
00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
well we're not open um so where does
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
that leave you now you've got to go a
 
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
couple days without driving until you
 
00:32:45.789 --> 00:32:45.799 align:start position:0%
can get somebody to drive you to the DMV
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
so that you can actually apply to get
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
your horizontal license so I think it's
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
a it's a great fix and I want to thank
 
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
representative a for um bringing it
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
forward and uh getting us to this point
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
I'm happy happy to take any
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir any questions
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Miller
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you uh
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
director for your testimony I just want
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
to confirm the logistics of these the
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
new licenses being printed the
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
horizontal ones yall will hold them or
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
not print them until the appropriate
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
time that's not going to be a logistical
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
problem with the flow of licenses coming
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
out of the office that will weird
 
00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
anything out along the way right no it's
 
00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:24.919 align:start position:0%
a great representative Mill great
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
question and one that we definitely want
 
00:33:28.269 --> 00:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure we got just right and
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
speaking with our technology vendors you
 
00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:32.519 align:start position:0%
can write uh once once the renewal takes
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
place um they can write a program so
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
that um that is being tracked and as
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
soon as at midnight when the 21st
 
00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
birthday uh takes place that's when the
 
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
uh it would go into the queue to be
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
printed in hard copy so um we would we
 
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
would cover that but that's a great
 
00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
Peto thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to clarify the the idea
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
of it seemed like a lot of the languages
 
00:34:02.669 --> 00:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
in here was about a temporary license
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
but it sounded like the scenario you're
 
00:34:07.069 --> 00:34:07.079 align:start position:0%
describing is essentially
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
granting um a 30-day extension to the
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
youth license in
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
practicality am I correct or can you
 
00:34:16.589 --> 00:34:16.599 align:start position:0%
just narrow in on that yeah that that's
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
a great question so the the youth
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
operator uh for purposes of still being
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
valid would go beyond um the 21st
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
birthday so that you're still operating
 
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
on a license that that you renewed but
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
quite frankly once that once that hard
 
00:34:33.869 --> 00:34:33.879 align:start position:0%
copy is printed and you're waiting for
 
00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
it um for purposes of driving you're
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
valid and you are actually in the eyes
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement because you're over
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
21 you've got the youth operator um
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
receipt or the youth operator license
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
that you got at the DMV because that's
 
00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:49.079 align:start position:0%
all we were able to give you at those
 
00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
two moments in time but for purposes of
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement you're going to be
 
00:34:55.149 --> 00:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
considered a non- youth operator until
 
00:34:56.829 --> 00:34:56.839 align:start position:0%
you get your hard copy in the mail so
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
that's that's a good point um but that's
 
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:02.200 align:start position:0%
that's all we can offer you at that
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
moment in time when you come in and
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
again any other questions from the
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
committee representative G
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
gon thank you Mr chair um Vice chair yes
 
00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.510 align:start position:0%
gon thank you Mr chair um Vice chair yes
Mr

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
D Mr director um so similarly to what I
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
ask the representative is this program
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
going to be easier than trying to create
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
a shift of dates so that nobody's
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
expiring on their 21st
 
00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:33.079 align:start position:0%
birthday yeah it's a good question I we
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
used the Whiteboard we talked about a
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
lot of different um we looked at this
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
this option as the optimal option um I'd
 
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
have to play that out a little bit um so
 
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
basically what you're saying is we just
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
give the youth operator the extra 30
 
00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
days we give it the extra 30 days um but
 
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
then you still have to you still have to
 
00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
have the renewal that would have to take
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
place or the inperson visit
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
it prior to the 21st to trigger
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
something in the system to allow you to
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
get something that's going to be mailed
 
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
out to you so I you're still going to
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
have to have that work on the front end
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
to trigger what's going to happen on the
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
back end so I don't know if just the
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
extension will be enough follow up so in
 
00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
in your opinion this is the best way to
 
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:21.640 align:start position:0%
move forward correct yes thank you thank
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
you representative representative
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
Sykes yeah thank you uh Mr chair
 
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
director morasco can you if this is a an
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
expired um and their out of state how
 
00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
how is this going to work if the if the
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
license has expired and they're out of
 
00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
state yeah that's a great question
 
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for that well
 
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
the license receipt so if you renew
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
online you have that license receipt and
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
then you've got the youth operator
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
license hard copy that you've had for
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
the four almost five years um you'd be
 
00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
showing both of those um in the system
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
so in the system if you were to run that
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to see because of this bill
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
that you're still going to be valid as
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
an operator in the state of New
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh for law enforcement to see
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
birthday any other questions from the
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
committee is that a followup George yeah
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
followup um so how would it work as a
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
grace period in other words getting back
 
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
concept the on the on the back side so
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
the uh the youth operator status the
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
driver license status is still good for
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
the 30 days after the 21st birthday um
 
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
so anybody that checks the system you're
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
going to be you're going to have your
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
active status as far as the hard copy
 
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
license in transit um obviously you
 
00:37:55.309 --> 00:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
won't have that to show during that
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
30-day window but um but you still have
 
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
a valid identification a valid license
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
that you can present if you have an
 
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
interaction with law
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement thank you any other
 
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you sir
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone and uh we do not have
 
00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
any other pin cards so at this point I'm
 
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:19.640 align:start position:0%

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
was here because I know he would do a
 
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
better job than I'm probably going to
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
this bill um as some of you remember was
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
before us last year and probably several
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
times before that this would allow new
 
00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
vehicles purchased to basically after
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
their first inspection wait another year
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
after to get an inspection sticker so
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
basically what we're we're saying
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
I believe is that you go two years on
 
00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
the same sticker
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
um on a on a note that most of us we're
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
going to hear all kinds of reasons why
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't happen but I want to
 
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
remind everybody that with a new vehicle
 
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
the owners are trained to look at the
 
00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:18.790 align:start position:0%
the owners are trained to look at the
warranty

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
warranty
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
requirements and you reach a certain
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
mileage and you're going to go back in
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
and get War the checks for the warranty
 
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise your warranty is null and void
 
00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:27.589 align:start position:0%
otherwise your warranty is null and void
and

00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
nobody wants
 
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
that you're going to go in for oil
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
changes quite often uh these places will
 
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
offer free oil
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
changes your car goes in for that oil
 
00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
change they're going to check everything
 
00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
else actually do that for the rest of
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
your life they're going to try to
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
upcharge on everything and and that's
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
pretty much uh the way it goes
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
everywhere so I think um on behalf of
 
00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers who this is going to help
 
00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
out uh this is a good Bill and certainly
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
my constituents when I bring this up to
 
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
them people that have bought a new
 
00:46:05.069 --> 00:46:05.079 align:start position:0%
vehicle say yeah that makes sense that
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's great great do
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
it that's pretty much going to be my
 
00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
introduction to this
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
bill all right thank you representative
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
representative Hamlin thank you Mr
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
chairperson thank you for taking my
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
question does this apply to commercial
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles as well
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's a good question but I do I did
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
not see that in
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
here uh I don't think it does I don't I
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
don't believe it does because we had
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
that discussion before about commercial
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles so I do not believe that do
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
this is for private uh Vehicles not
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
commercial right we'll confirm but I
 
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
believe that to be true I don't believe
 
00:46:51.549 --> 00:46:51.559 align:start position:0%
it does uh any other questions from the
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none they let you off
 
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:55.640 align:start position:0%
the hook pretty easy representative say
 
00:46:56.589 --> 00:46:56.599 align:start position:0%
that again they let you off the hook
 
00:46:59.549 --> 00:46:59.559 align:start position:0%
pretty easy easy they did thank you uh
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
next up chair
 
00:47:04.109 --> 00:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
recognizes Daniel weed represent the
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill ladies and gentlemen good morning
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time this morning uh
 
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
sorry to see that the prime sponsor is
 
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
not here this morning because uh some of
 
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
these questions are directed towards him
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
and his career I see by the state
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
legislator's website that he is a
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
professional pilot uh and it's
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
surprising to me that of all the people
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
as a career pilot that he would ask to
 
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
resend an inspection program he clearly
 
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
understands the importance of an annual
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
inspection program regarding aircraft uh
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
so why wouldn't a series of vehicles
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
that has 50 times the amount of volume
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
on the road uh require an inspection you
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
can't fly an aircraft without an annual
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
inspection can you and would this as a
 
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
career pilot would he even fly an
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
aircraft without an annual inspection so
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
why should should your car be any
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
different uh the way this bill is
 
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
written uh it now exempts 2 years from
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
Cars light trucks medium trucks heavy
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
trucks RVs trailers and commercial
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles there's no exemption in this
 
00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
bill to the way it's written so if you
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
can imagine an 880,000 lb
 
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
18-wheeler with its trailer and
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
everything uh Exempted for 2 years and
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
when these vehicles do at least 50 plus
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
thousand miles a year it's 100,000 miles
 
00:48:32.589 --> 00:48:32.599 align:start position:0%
before that heavy commercial vehicle is
 
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
inspected uh based on numbers by motor
 
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh given to me this will now
 
00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.230 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh given to me this will now
eliminate

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
25,2 30h a year based on statistics
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
given by eliminating the two model years
 
00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
he will now need to modify the contract
 
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
with the current inspection program
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
provider the contract will have to be
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
Rewritten to pass the cost on to those
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
of us who don't have new
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles you will then see the cost of
 
00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
annual inspections increase from the
 
00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
current market rate of approximately $40
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
to $50 potentially to $75 to
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
$100 and I don't see calculations for
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
the loss of income in the bill uh to the
 
00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:14.839 align:start position:0%
small local businesses and if you take
 
00:49:14.839 --> 00:49:15.589 align:start position:0%
small local businesses and if you take
that

00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
205,000 230 inspections that you're
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
reducing by an average of say $50 per
 
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
inspection you're reducing the income to
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
small businesses per year by 10,000 10,
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
$276,500 to the state small businesses
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
so you're taking $10 million away from
 
00:49:36.119 --> 00:49:36.950 align:start position:0%
so you're taking $10 million away from
small

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:39.079 align:start position:0%
businesses please keep in mind that the
 
00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:40.839 align:start position:0%
people that you're going to most affect
 
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
are those that don't have the extra
 
00:49:44.589 --> 00:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
money to begin with I can clearly
 
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
Envision tomorrow's
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
headlines inspection elimination Bill
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
proposed to help reduce government
 
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
oversight while doubling the cost of
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
inspections to the state's
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
residents thank you
 
00:49:58.829 --> 00:49:58.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
00:50:00.789 --> 00:50:00.799 align:start position:0%
the committee if you'll take any
 
00:50:00.799 --> 00:50:03.549 align:start position:0%
the committee if you'll take any
represent

00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
G thank you Mr chair thank you sir so
 
00:50:09.069 --> 00:50:09.079 align:start position:0%
your position then is that uh because
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
the government mandates inspections the
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
less inspections that the government
 
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
mandates the higher the price would have
 
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
to be for the private
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
vendor that's correct correct
 
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
yes other
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
you um the cards keep coming in uh um
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
just because I'm sure he has other
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
business to attend to late arrival
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland in support of
 
00:50:39.789 --> 00:50:39.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
sir thank you I appreciate you uh sling
 
00:50:44.829 --> 00:50:44.839 align:start position:0%
me in there representative McFarland
 
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
from Orange uh here to testify in
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I I don't have a
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
lot to say I think the bill speaks for
 
00:50:53.069 --> 00:50:53.079 align:start position:0%
itself I I do however want to convey
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
that uh my constituents are uh
 
00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
interested Ed in Road Safety but they
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
are also interested in cost of living
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
and if you have a brand new vehicle uh
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
it is good for a period of time that
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
that is typically longer than some of
 
00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
the older vehicles out there I support
 
00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
this bill and if there's any questions
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to Y to
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
them thank you sir any questions from

if you can I promise I won't speak that
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
long it up that'd be great thank
 
00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
you good morning everyone my name is
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
Alicia I'm the service manager of new
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
car automo in til to New Hampshire I
 
00:51:50.789 --> 00:51:50.799 align:start position:0%
just wanted to go over some general
 
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
information in regards to state
 
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
inspections currently so the 13
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
inspectable items include registration
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
plates registration certificate and
 
00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle identification number steering
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
and suspension brakes including parking
 
00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:05.799 align:start position:0%
brake odometer and speedometer
 
00:52:08.789 --> 00:52:08.799 align:start position:0%
electrical system horn and defroster
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
lights and reflectors including
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
headlight aim glass glazing mirrors
 
00:52:16.589 --> 00:52:16.599 align:start position:0%

diagnostic systems body chassis bumper
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
height fuel system tires and wheels um
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
none of these components really show
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
Grace in regards to time and/ or mileage
 
00:52:28.829 --> 00:52:28.839 align:start position:0%
I've seen it firsthand I've seen
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
vehicles with 12,000 Mi come in with
 
00:52:34.589 --> 00:52:34.599 align:start position:0%
lower than 2 30 seconds of tread um I've
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
seen multiple Vehicles come in with
 
00:52:38.349 --> 00:52:38.359 align:start position:0%
rusted or pitted rotors causing a
 
00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
vehicle to fail inspection um doesn't
 
00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
allow for Effective braking and once
 
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
again this does not show any Grace in
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
regards to mileage Andor time I've seen
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
it on new vehicles I've seen it on
 
00:52:50.589 --> 00:52:50.599 align:start position:0%
10-year-old Vehicles doesn't really show
 
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
Grace unfortunately we drive on salted
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
roads so all of these components
 
00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
typically are influenced very young in a
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle's lifetime even when you think
 
00:53:00.789 --> 00:53:00.799 align:start position:0%
about it if you're not driving your
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle your vehicle's sitting it's
 
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
going to get rusted if you are driving
 
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
your vehicle I mean some people put
 
00:53:09.309 --> 00:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
30,000 40,000 miles on their vehicle per
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
year all these components are wearable
 
00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
items they're going to wear by time and
 
00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
mileage and it's going to be well within
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
the threshold of one year Andor two
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
years of ownership um so I definitely
 
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
strongly appeal this and if anybody has
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
any questions please let me
 
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%

00:53:38.589 --> 00:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
testimony with all those facts on it I
 
00:53:41.789 --> 00:53:41.799 align:start position:0%
do not okay thank
 
00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:43.799 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:49.400 align:start position:0%

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the

00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
Transport Association I just want to
 
00:54:08.349 --> 00:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
clarify inspections with commercial
 
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles because it's been talked
 
00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
about twice here so any commercial motor
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle must be inspected once a year
 
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
it's under federal guidelines it very
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
specifically it's under 49 CFR Cod of
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation 396 appendix a so at
 
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
once every 12 months they must be
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
inspected um so this legislation cannot
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
impact that so I just wanted to clarify
 
00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:34.839 align:start position:0%
that thank you appreciate it sir thank
 
00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:37.880 align:start position:0%

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
bill seeking five minutes but I know he
 
00:54:45.309 --> 00:54:45.319 align:start position:0%
can do it in much
 
00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
sir uh thank you Mr chairman members of
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
the committee I will be uh as brief as
 
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
possible Dan Bennett New Hampshire Auto
 
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.040 align:start position:0%

00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
HB 209 as we have in the past years um
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is not about new cars a new
 
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
car is a car that rolls right off the
 
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
the the truck from Detroit or Deerborn
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
or wherever it comes from I I'm willing
 
00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
to bet that if you went to purchase a
 
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle you rolled into that dealership
 
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh after 15 months and 25 ,000 miles on
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
the vehicle when you went to purchase it
 
00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:30.839 align:start position:0%
you would not call that a new vehicle
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
okay so this when when we call this
 
00:55:34.029 --> 00:55:34.039 align:start position:0%
about new vehicles this is not about new
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
vehicles it's about vehicles that can go
 
00:55:39.549 --> 00:55:39.559 align:start position:0%
up to 24,000 excuse me 24 months um with
 
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
an incredible number of miles we employ
 
00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:43.799 align:start position:0%
a fleet uh of of our road staff our
 
00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:45.799 align:start position:0%
safety prevention loss prevention uh
 
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
they average 25,000 mil per year uh this
 
00:55:52.029 --> 00:55:52.039 align:start position:0%
vehicle will in fact apply to um to
 
00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicles it's uh it's right
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
there um and section uh four new
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
paragraph 4 a line 9 or line 8 and N
 
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
deal with corporations and the inspect
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
the months in which in corporate
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
Vehicles will be inspected um this also
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
isn't a two-year sticker bill this is an
 
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
exemption Bill uh so there there's
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill affords a a new
 
00:56:15.549 --> 00:56:15.559 align:start position:0%
vehicle to roll off the truck and get a
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
two-year sticker this is a no inspection
 
00:56:20.349 --> 00:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
sticker for two years so um I anticipate
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
law enforcement both state and local
 
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
will have something to say about that um
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
so I'll try and bounce through my
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
testimony I do in fact have copies of
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
our handouts which has a lot of
 
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
information that I'll send both ways um
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
including a copy for the clerk um so a
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
couple uh points that I'll mention um as
 
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
of January 2025 Carfax um says that over
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
58.1 M million vehicles are on the road
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
um that have unresolved safety uh
 
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
recalls um it's a 16% increase in over
 
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:55.640 align:start position:0%
two years um the manufacturers are are
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
prioriti in ride quality over longevity
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
um and tires we're hearing show tread uh
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
tread failure uh at 20,000 Mi um and we
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
see a lot of incidences especially
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
recently where Vehicles slide off the
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
road um you know creating accident or
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
injury or unsafe um conditions and it's
 
00:57:17.549 --> 00:57:17.559 align:start position:0%
usually due to Tire condition um so in
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
in the past we've talked about studies
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
we did a lot of research in the off year
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
um the most recent study we found a July
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
2023 Journal of Transportation engine in
 
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
article found that states without safety
 
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
inspections have 5% uh fewer annual
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
fatalities than those without this past
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
year as you all know probably seen from
 
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
TV radio WMUR um in 2024 135 people died
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire roads which was a 5%
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
increase over last year but the really
 
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
scary fertility or really scary
 
00:57:49.789 --> 00:57:49.799 align:start position:0%
statistic is that youth youth fatalities
 
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
Rose over
 
00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
233% so we would venture to say this is
 
00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
not a time to weaken the of New
 
00:57:59.230 --> 00:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire roads um and that's what we
 
00:58:04.349 --> 00:58:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
um um I believe you'll probably hear
 
00:58:08.349 --> 00:58:08.359 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Environmental
 
00:58:10.589 --> 00:58:10.599 align:start position:0%
Services as we have historically as to
 
00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
whether the EPA would even uh approve
 
00:58:14.349 --> 00:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
this amendment to our state
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
implementation plan under our Clean Air
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
Act requirements uh which is tied to
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway funding
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
um there is talk about States and places
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
that weaken their program however what
 
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
we are in fact seeing and it's based on
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
that study from the Journal of
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
transportation engineering um that
 
00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:31.720 align:start position:0%
several jurisdictions International
 
00:58:33.549 --> 00:58:33.559 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions have already adapted
 
00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
safety inspections to include testing
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
and calibrating systems that's some
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
of the more technical equipment that's
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
in your vehicle the Advanced Driver
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
assistance systems the lane steering the
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
lane correction the vibrating steering
 
00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
wheel um you know the the lane change um
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
as well as the forward and and behind
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
Collision Repair so um what we're
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
actually seeing as a focus on that is is
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
actually a deeper dive into what items
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
should be inspected um all of our
 
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
neighboring states do safety inspections
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
it's because New England has a unique
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
microclimate you'll see it in the
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
handout that I have we include a winter
 
00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:08.839 align:start position:0%
severity map that you all have seen
 
00:59:12.029 --> 00:59:12.039 align:start position:0%
before you can talk about snowier States
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
um but New England's microclimate is
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
much more severe um we have we have rain
 
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
at first of the year we have deep
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
freezes we have Frost Hees we spray
 
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
liquid saltwater on our roads that then
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
splatters onto the undercarriage of our
 
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles and coats all of our equipment
 
00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
inclusing including hoses brakes rotors
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
um so you'll see that in what we um in
 
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
what we hand out for you um from some of
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
the failure statistics that we have just
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
so you know you know in model year 2024
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
there's 1.3 million safety inspections
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
done um you know there were over 170,000
 
00:59:52.349 --> 00:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
failures um and that's in that in in
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
that 2024 year so we still have
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
incredibly High failure numbers even
 
00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
with um even with our safety inspection
 
01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
program and an important component of
 
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
the safety inspection program is it does
 
01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
a mandatory safety recall data check to
 
01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
see if you have an outstanding safety
 
01:00:08.589 --> 01:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
recall that recall is then done at the
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
consumer and it's done at the consumer
 
01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
at no cost just like these vehicles in
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
their first two years which is usually
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
about a manufacturer's warranty there
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
are some outliers Honda or Hyundai may
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
go 10 years um but it catches items that
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
are under warranty that are done at no
 
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
cost to the consumer and that's why it
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
has a value to the consumer not a cost
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
same thing with recall data we miss a
 
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
lot of those little postcards that come
 
01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
in our mailbox but you don't when you're
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
service riter tells you across the
 
01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
counter or slams that seat on your
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
passenger seat and you see that there's
 
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
a a service recall related to your O2
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
sensor um in 2025 alone there's already
 
01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
been 465 safety recalls issued in 2024
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire consumers this is in
 
01:00:51.789 --> 01:00:51.799 align:start position:0%
20124 there were over 10,000 safety
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
recalls issued to Consumers and in 2023
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
there were over 21,000 so all this is
 
01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:58.039 align:start position:0%
put in front of the consumers this is a
 
01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:01.240 align:start position:0%
consumer friendly program um we would
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
say um and then just the other item that
 
01:01:05.309 --> 01:01:05.319 align:start position:0%
I'll mention to and I'll stop before the
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
chairman throws me out is the fiscal
 
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
impact um you'll see at the end of the
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
bill there is a fiscal note to the state
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
you all have heard about the the um the
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
budgetary issue that we're having um
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
this is no time to be lessening Monies
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
to um the state highway fund as well as
 
01:01:22.589 --> 01:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
the monies from this program that go to
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
the local municipalities so um with that
 
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
being said um we'd like you to keep that
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
in mind um and please take a look at um
 
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
the information that that we send around
 
01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:36.039 align:start position:0%
both ways um and I'll be willing to take
 
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
questions here or in person or after
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
digesting some of this offline but um
 
01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you sir questions from
 
01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:45.799 align:start position:0%
the committee I believe I have one front
 
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.039 align:start position:0%
loaded representative Hill thank you Mr
 
01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you for taking my
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
question M Bennett um are you saying
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
that the increase in motor vehicle
 
01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
deaths are attributable to um
 
01:02:01.069 --> 01:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
inspectable items no I'm not saying that
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
they it's attributable directly to
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
inspection items but what I'm saying is
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
that we have a a situation where our
 
01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
roads are becoming more unsafe our
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
contention is that if you stop
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
inspecting Vehicles it will be more
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
unsafe vehicles on the road so we would
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
tend to say that would probably
 
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
contribute to that going forward I'm not
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
going to say that the 135 fatalities are
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
strictly mechanical
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
failures thank you just clarifying
 
01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:27.559 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
representative hlin thank you Mr
 
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking my
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
questions so I just want to clarify in
 
01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
my mind is it your position that brand
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
new vehicles ones that have never been
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
titled before when they leave the
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
dealership they do not have an
 
01:02:46.349 --> 01:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker on them for two
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
years uh thank you for the question
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative hlin under this bill as
 
01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:53.799 align:start position:0%
written our belief is that this provides
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
no mechanism for a 2-year sticker it's
 
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't talk about anything about a
 
01:02:59.789 --> 01:02:59.799 align:start position:0%
two-year sper when it actually says uh a
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle purchased during the prior to or
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
during the vehicle model year from a
 
01:03:05.309 --> 01:03:05.319 align:start position:0%
licensed dealer by natural person shall
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
be exempt from inspection until the last
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
day of the register's owner birth month
 
01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
in the second year after purchase
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that they'll get a two-year
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
sticker that expires on their birth date
 
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
it just says no expect it's an exemption
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
from the program completely for both
 
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
commercial and passenger
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
vehicles thank you that is an accurate
 
01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.559 align:start position:0%
reading follow up follow up thank you um
 
01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
so one more little track I know for a
 
01:03:34.589 --> 01:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
fact that people have buy new vehicles
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
and within the first year they're in an
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
accident have to go to a body shop and
 
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
built rebuilt partially or
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
extensively um do you have any data or
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
is there anything that says when those
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
cards come back into u a shop that some
 
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
the mechanic will pick up on something
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
that was fosly done in the body shop
 
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
that now has to be Rec
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
corrected so
 
01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.910 align:start position:0%
corrected so
uh

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
the following the so let me see if I if
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
I follow your question and then try and
 
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
answer it accurately so following the
 
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
Collision when your vehicle is required
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
by your insurance policy to be restored
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
to pre-loss condition you would then
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
leave that instance and then you would
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
go for your annual inspection the annual
 
01:04:26.589 --> 01:04:26.599 align:start position:0%
inspection would review items that are
 
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
under the annual inspection program it
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
would not do an analysis of whether the
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
cons the the restoration at The Body
 
01:04:38.589 --> 01:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
Shop met the
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
manufacturers uh repair procedures or
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
the pre-loss condition agreement that
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
you had with your insurance agent it
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
would be based on what the state
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
inspection program is um as um Miss
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
Britain referred to so uh the inspection
 
01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
station would would not be checking the
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
validity of the body shops repair
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
process if that's what you're asking
 
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions I knew you
 
01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
were G to do that representative
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
B thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh are you familiar
 
01:05:10.349 --> 01:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
with Rhode Islands law I think it's very
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
similar to this they don't require a STi
 
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
for the first two years but they do have
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's a 20 or
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
$25,000 20 25,000 mile uh restriction uh
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
where you would have to have it
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
inspected um are you familiar with that
 
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
and how how does it work there and as
 
01:05:28.109 --> 01:05:28.119 align:start position:0%
far as enforcement we seeing the lack of
 
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
a sticker for two years how does that
 
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
work and would
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
you be more likely to support the bill
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
and had a mileage limitation like that
 
01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
uh so thanks for the question represent
 
01:05:40.029 --> 01:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately I'm not familiar with
 
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
the Rhode Island program um I know um
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
you know the New Hampshire program as it
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
is um what I do know is that in other
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
states that have um weakened or
 
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
eliminated their safety inspection
 
01:05:53.549 --> 01:05:53.559 align:start position:0%
program alog together what they have in
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
fact done is Empower law enforcement to
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
do a greater level of roadside
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement as far as mechanical and
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
safety items um so that's part of the
 
01:06:05.789 --> 01:06:05.799 align:start position:0%
tradeoff um that's not what proposed
 
01:06:08.269 --> 01:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
here um I'd be curious to see what uh
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
both state and local law enforcement
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
feel about um greater roadside safety
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
mechanical inspection you you can't see
 
01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
brakes from the outside of a car you got
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
to get in and under them right um and
 
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
then the liability associated with that
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
so you let someone drive off and a mile
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
and a half down the road uh they slide
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
off the road um but law enforcement just
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
had the vehicle on the side of the road
 
01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:31.799 align:start position:0%
a mile and a half earlier that liability
 
01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
chain would would make me a little bit
 
01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
nervous um but um whether that in fact
 
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
is included in the Rhode Island program
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
I do not know um it's a discussion if
 
01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
you and I would like to to take a look
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
at it and chat about it but um I can't
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
say I no enough about it and certainly
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
to say that whether we would support it
 
01:06:48.319 --> 01:06:50.910 align:start position:0%
to say that whether we would support it
or

01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
not anybody else seeing none thank you
 
01:06:56.349 --> 01:06:56.359 align:start position:0%
very much thank you Mr thanks for making
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
a liar of me I knew you couldn't get it
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
done in 5 minutes um next up chair
 
01:07:03.069 --> 01:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
recognizes Tracy Boris representing the
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire motorcyclist rights
 
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
organization uh opposed to the bill
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you chairman Walsh
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
committee members I am Tracy borage I'm
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
the president of New Hampshire
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
motorcycle rights organization and just
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
to make you aware I'm also the chair of
 
01:07:25.309 --> 01:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire motorcycle safety task
 
01:07:25.319 --> 01:07:26.029 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire motorcycle safety task
force

01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
force
 
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:27.640 align:start position:0%
I represent motorcycles on the New
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire traffic and safety commission
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
I also sit on the board of the
 
01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
motorcycle riders Foundation mrf which
 
01:07:35.789 --> 01:07:35.799 align:start position:0%
is the national voice for motorcyclist
 
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
so I spend a lot of my time doing
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
motorcycling things in my spare time I
 
01:07:43.069 --> 01:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
ride we're here because we've had many
 
01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
many discussions over the years about
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
inspections um the the bond of our
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
organization the people that I represent
 
01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
believe that inspections keep
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
motorcycles and cars safer mostly due to
 
01:07:57.549 --> 01:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
the tires and the brakes and I can tell
 
01:08:00.029 --> 01:08:00.039 align:start position:0%
you that there are many of us that ride
 
01:08:02.109 --> 01:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
I have several friends that have bought
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
brand new bikes and put more than 50,000
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
miles on them in a season you can bet
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
that they need a new tire and if they're
 
01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
not getting inspected this is not the
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
old school biker world where my husband
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
and a lot of our friends came from where
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
they looked at their tire tread or they
 
01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
could change their brakes the New Riders
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
out there y'all have seen them on the
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
roads are disregarding the speed limits
 
01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
and what what's happening so to keep us
 
01:08:30.269 --> 01:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
safer I don't want to ride my motorcycle
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
by somebody like that but I also don't
 
01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
want to ride my motorcycle with a
 
01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle that may have tires or brakes
 
01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
that are going to take me out so we are
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
asking that you look at that and
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
consider this because there are cars
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
that do the same thing that put many
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
more miles than they
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
average and that's all I have thank you
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
very much any questions from the
 
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
committee seeing n thanks again thank
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
you uh next up chair recognize
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
tooon Aon Scott Aon the H State
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
Police in opposition to the bill seeking
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
five minutes welcome sir thank you Mr
 
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
chairman and me members of the
 
01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
committee uh the state of State Police
 
01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
would definitely oppose this um House
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
Bill 209 I'll just speak briefly I know
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
I put five minutes but I'll speak
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
briefly on um the concerns for law
 
01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement um Mr Bennett covered a lot
 
01:09:34.189 --> 01:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
of it the majority of the concerns would
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
be there's no two-year sticker process
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
in plan for this thing so law
 
01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement potentially will be stopping
 
01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
cars because they'll see a no inspection
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
even though it's a new car they'll see
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
no inspection they'll stop it and it
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
could get into at that time safety risk
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
for the officer roadside because now
 
01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
he's stopping a vehicle roadside when
 
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
maybe he doesn't even need to because is
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
they're exempt um or it could lead to
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
other things where law enforcement might
 
01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
find other issues with this car as far
 
01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
as you know potentially violations not
 
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
not having to do anything with the car
 
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
but other violations that could
 
01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
potentially turn into arrests and then
 
01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
once we get into a judicial system with
 
01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
this they could be you know what was the
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
reason for the Stop well it had no
 
01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
sticker well it didn't need an ex
 
01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
sticker was exempt and chances chances
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
of getting something tossed in court are
 
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
there for that as well um talked
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
about law enforcement having to do more
 
01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
roadside mechanical inspections I know
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
they're newer vehicles but these
 
01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles are now heavier because a lot
 
01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
of them are electric a lot of them are
 
01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
all-wheel drive they heat up tires
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
faster so now you'll have a law
 
01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer out there
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
potentially walking around a car
 
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
roadside trying to determine if the
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
tires are good um stuff that they can
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
see so it's it's more of a risk for us
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
and concern especially where there's no
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
two-year sticker um Implement
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
implemented for this uh the commercial
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle sticker they have to have
 
01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
a federal annual
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
so we used in New Hampshire they
 
01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:07.640 align:start position:0%
recognize our state inspection as a
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
federal annual sticker so that helps
 
01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
that helps the um commercial motor
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle industry because they don't have
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
that that covers their Federal annual so
 
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
law enforcement sees a New Hampshire
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
valid inspection sticker on that CMV we
 
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
know it has a federal annual sticker
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
it's good to go new vehicles if this
 
01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
applies to them now we don't see that
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
sticker so now we got to go looking for
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
the federal annual and they put they put
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
those in a different location which
 
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
aren't visible a lot of times to law
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement so now you got a law
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement Trooper out there roadside
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
trying to walk around a truck to find
 
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
the federal annual sticker so those are
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
just some of the concerns I won't cover
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
it um any of the other ones because most
 
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
of them were covered but these newer
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
Vehicles they do wear out TI tires are
 
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
probably the biggest thing and I know
 
01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
that we're supposed to all look at our
 
01:11:54.629 --> 01:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
ties to make sure but I can tell you
 
01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
from I have my son he's got a brand new
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
2000 tracks I looked at his tires the
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
other day Saturday year and his TIR is a
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
warn out I put a tread front tires a
 
01:12:05.229 --> 01:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
worn out because it's front-wheel drive
 
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
so I put a tread depth there 330 seconds
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
so two years on a new car it's great if
 
01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
somebody's watching what they're doing
 
01:12:13.149 --> 01:12:13.159 align:start position:0%
but if they're not they're going to wear
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
out their ties and they might not even
 
01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
know until it's too late and it's winter
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
and they're sliding off the road so
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
those are just some of the concerns law
 
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement has um and I'd be happy to
 
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you might have
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
for me thank you sir any questions from
 
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:31.960 align:start position:0%
SES is it safe to say that uh winter
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
driving conditions will also impact on
 
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
how tires perform and we have a um as I
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
recall from previous testimony that New
 
01:12:45.629 --> 01:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has some of the more
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
interesting winter
 
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
weather that is that's true we run into
 
01:12:53.629 --> 01:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
that now currently whether it's whether
 
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
they get a valid state inspection not
 
01:12:58.110 --> 01:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
more times than not especially this time
 
01:13:00.669 --> 01:13:00.679 align:start position:0%
of year cars that are going off the road
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
yes it's due to the speed related but a
 
01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
lot of the times it's due to their tires
 
01:13:06.669 --> 01:13:06.679 align:start position:0%
are just they might not be below the
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
inspection requirements but they're
 
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
they're worn out for winter driving um
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
so yeah we run into that a lot and and a
 
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
lot of times with these accidents that's
 
01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
what we see it's the tires I mean you
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
can't really see the brakes without
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
taking tires off so a lot of times it's
 
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
Tire related issues um the cars are
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
heavier especially the electric cars
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
those are a lot heavier and the
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
all-wheel drive cars because my wife has
 
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
an all-wheel drive car and I'm like how
 
01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
are we eating tires up so fast but they
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
just eat them up fast because they're
 
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know you buy a softer tire for the
 
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
winter and um we wear them out faster so
 
01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
yes in New Hampshire especially in the
 
01:13:43.229 --> 01:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
Northeast the tires are crucial and
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
making sure you know getting them
 
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
checked once a year that's good we don't
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know I don't I think going to plus
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
years to get somebody to actually a
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
mechanic to look at a car to make sure
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
the T I know it's the owner but a state
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
inspection every year in the state we're
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
trying to keep the road safe in New
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I think we do a good job of
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
that now and I would just hate to see
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
even though the new cars I would hate to
 
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
see that we would um blackx on our
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
safety level
 
01:14:12.189 --> 01:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
there any other
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
questions Repro thank you Mr chair and
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you officer for taking my question
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
um uh please please uh forgive me this
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
might be a little bit funny but like my
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
birthday is in
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
July we're in January right now let's
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
say tomorrow I go and buy a brand new
 
01:14:35.229 --> 01:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
car and let's say is a part is it
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
possible for a part of the deal that
 
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
that new car could be inspected through
 
01:14:45.629 --> 01:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
July 31st
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
2026 or am I in a situation where if I
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
buy that car tomorrow the longest I can
 
01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.830 --> 01:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
I believe it's the the what you said
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
through 26 two years from the time you
 
01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
from the time you register 18 months but
 
01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
18 not two
 
01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:09.400 align:start position:0%
years two years would be the Max on
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
yours I think okay got it thank
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
you I'd have to look at the law to make
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
sure though okay any other questions
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
from the committee being none thank
 
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome thank
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
you so much and just a general question
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
I have not not to you but you ever
 
01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
notice that when we talk about
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
inspection stickers electric vehicles
 
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
are much heavier than internal
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
combustion engine but when we're talking
 
01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
about them parking in garages they're
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
not uh next up chair recognizes Michael

01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
morning good morning Mr chair members of
 
01:15:54.189 --> 01:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
the committee Michael Fitzgerald I'm the
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
assistant director of the air Resources
 
01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
Division at the Department of
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and I'm here
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
today to speak to the only the emissions
 
01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
portion of the inspection program uh not
 
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
the safety we we run the uh inspection
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
program jointly with the Department of
 
01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
Safety we work
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
cooperatively um to so that the
 
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
inspections are done concurrently um but
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
we have purview on the emissions
 
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
inspection uh just by way of History the
 
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
uh emissions inspection that we
 
01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
currently have in New Hampshire is a
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
compromise that was arrived DED at back
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
in the early 2000s with EPA uh New
 
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as its status uh having
 
01:16:34.510 --> 01:16:34.520 align:start position:0%
formally been in non-attainment
 
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
for um uh Federal pollution standards
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
and as a result of being in the ozone
 
01:16:43.629 --> 01:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
transport region which is a f federally
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
designated uh area of the country
 
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
generally uh the States from Virginia
 
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
north um and so the Clean Air Act
 
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
requires under the uh requirements for
 
01:16:58.270 --> 01:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
the ozone transport region Vehicle
 
01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
Emission Inspection programs that's why
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
you uh we often get the question why do
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
different states have different
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
inspection requirements and we have a
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
more stringent inspection requirement um
 
01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
in the ozone transport region so uh
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
those those States uh the New Hampshire
 
01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:17.320 align:start position:0%
inspection is part of our New Hampshire
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
State implementation plan which is a
 
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
document that we submit to EPA they
 
01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
approve and then it becomes federally
 
01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.110 align:start position:0%
approve and then it becomes federally
enforceable

01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
enforceable
 
01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
so again we take no position on this and
 
01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
we again I don't I'm not addressing the
 
01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
safety portion of of this at all but on
 
01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
the emissions inspection program um we
 
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
would lose some emission reductions and
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
those emissions reductions would have to
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
be made up by some other sector um we
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
would have to work with EPA in order to
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh have a revision to our state
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
implementation approved that generally
 
01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
takes anywhere from 12 to 18 months so
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
our ask of the committee um I have here
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh which I'll share uh copies uh we we
 
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
sent a letter of testimony yesterday to
 
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
the entire committee I will share copies
 
01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
of a letter from
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
EPA uh that was uh sent last year in
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
response to this spill that um
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
explaining the situation with our Sip
 
01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
and the requirement to to change the Sip
 
01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
so uh what we would ask is that if this
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
bill were to go forward that you give
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
consideration to language similar to uh
 
01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
and I have put a link in our testimony
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
letter uh the currently proposed s SP
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
1557 relative to rental Fleet
 
01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
inspections uh that I assume will come
 
01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
to this committee later some point but
 
01:18:43.709 --> 01:18:43.719 align:start position:0%
that that bill has language in it that
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
would allow the emissions inspection to
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
remain unchanged until such time as the
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
certifies to the Secretary of State that
 
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh we have had the a change to the uh
 
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh and that revision approved by EPA and
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh EPA does have the authority to uh
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
hold sanctions against the state that
 
01:19:06.430 --> 01:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
was how we entered into this compromise
 
01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
in the first place we were supposed to
 
01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
have a tailpipe inspection strictly
 
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
reading the interpretation of the law
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire negotiated the OBD uh
 
01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle emissions inspection your check
 
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
engine light that everyone loves on your
 
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle um and so uh we would simply ask
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
that uh if this bill were to move
 
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
forward uh again not withstanding any of
 
01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
the safety issues uh on the emissions
 
01:19:32.669 --> 01:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
inspection that you consider language
 
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
similar to that in sb1
 
01:19:38.910 --> 01:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
157 uh and I have uh copies of of the
 
01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
letter to EPA and uh uh the sb17
 
01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
language that I'll leave with the uh
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
chair and the secretary and be happy to
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%

01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%

most of the testimony that's you've
 
01:20:29.229 --> 01:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
already heard uh I Echo it uh we we
 
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill my name is John morasco
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
director of the DMV uh we oppose the
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
bill and the written testimony
 
01:20:38.110 --> 01:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
highlights the reasons why uh from our
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
standpoint on behalf of the Department
 
01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
of Safety it's uh it's a safety issue
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's a program that works uh we don't
 
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
receive a large number of complaints
 
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
about the program we do get a complaint
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
that comes in uh for predatory
 
01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
inspections or anything along those
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
lines uh we work with our state police
 
01:20:56.350 --> 01:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
partner ERS and automotive equipment
 
01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
inspectors who go out and do a followup
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
and an audit and if there's an issue
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's brought forth um the inspection
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
station or or mechanic could be brought
 
01:21:09.149 --> 01:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
in for a hearing um but like I said we
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh we also have seen a um and I
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
testified last session on this a growth
 
01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
in in transparency for inspections I use
 
01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
groni Mazda here in coch as an example
 
01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
we went toward uh their inspection
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
facility uh not only did they give you a
 
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
video after the inspection um and the
 
01:21:26.350 --> 01:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
mechanic goes through the different
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
points uh that may have come up short
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
during the inspection but you can also
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
look through the window and see the
 
01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
inspection take place so um again we
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill we think the program
 
01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
works and uh happy to take any
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
questions thanks sir any questions from
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Hill thank
 
01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you director
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh is there
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
anything in the bill that um uh prohibit
 
01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:53.719 align:start position:0%
someone from voluntarily uh having their
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
their vehicle expected within those two
 
01:21:58.350 --> 01:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
years I'd have to look at the bill again
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
on that I'm not sure not sure off hand
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
do we have excuse followup followup do
 
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
we have a a way
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
um for someone to volunteer well U I
 
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
guess every inspection station would
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
just have the ability for having someone
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
stop in and ask for a voluntary
 
01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
inspection does that do we have that do
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
they get an updated I'm getting nods I
 
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
think I've got my answer question thank
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to follow up on that that
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
I hear you correctly now in voting
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
worlds you can volun you can pull over a
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol and voluntarily have them
 
01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
go through your vehicle and if you comp
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
if you comply with all the regulations
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
and safety they give you a little
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
sticker on the window that says you
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
voluntarily did this do we have
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
something like that for automobiles I'd
 
01:22:52.030 --> 01:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
have to check I have not heard of that
 
01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
no we did not I think it's a wonderful
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
idea but thank you uh any other
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%

01:31:04.510 --> 01:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
FN defining and enabling Lane filtering
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes the prime sponsor
 
01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
representative Reed welcome thank thank
 
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you honorable
 
01:31:13.629 --> 01:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
members um for the record my name is
 
01:31:15.629 --> 01:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
Ellen Reed I represent Rockingham 10
 
01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
that is New Market and new Fields um
 
01:31:22.830 --> 01:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
also for uh background on myself um in
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
terms of why I brought this bill forward
 
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
um I have been riding motorcycles for 18
 
01:31:33.550 --> 01:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
years um I've ridden in I believe 17
 
01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:35.800 align:start position:0%
States about a third of the states I
 
01:31:39.149 --> 01:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
think um I've ridden in seven countries
 
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
I've lost track of the number of
 
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
motorcycles I've written which I have to
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
say I don't own as many as I've tried
 
01:31:49.109 --> 01:31:49.119 align:start position:0%
that would be representative gon with
 
01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
his stable of dozens of very expensive
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
bikes um which I've had the pleasure of
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
seeing but uh the point being that I I
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
think I I I at least have 100,000 miles
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
under my belt on two
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
wheels so Lane filtering and I just
 
01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:09.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to find Lane filtering I know you
 
01:32:12.430 --> 01:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
can read the bill but Lane filtering is
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
when a motorcycle specifically two
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
wheels goes between lanes or depending
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
on if you're like right on top of the
 
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
line or slightly to the side of the line
 
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
um shares a lane with a uh car either at
 
01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
a stoplight or in extremely slow traffic
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
like in
 
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
construction um lane splitting which is
 
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
a term you may see in testimony or may
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
hear is an umbrella term that includes
 
01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
that behavior which is only at super low
 
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
speed or stopped traffic but also what
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
California does and California is the
 
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
only one where it's fully legal um which
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
is Lane share like lane splitting at
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
speed at at the speed limit this is not
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
that that lane splitting this is just
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
the very narrow Lane filtering that only
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
happens at um stopped traffic or very
 
01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:01.910 align:start position:0%
happens at um stopped traffic or very
slow

01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
slow
 
01:33:05.229 --> 01:33:05.239 align:start position:0%
speeds specifically 10 miles an hour or
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
less um so 17 states have lane splitting
 
01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
legal six of which have um affirmative
 
01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
affirmatively uh provided for protection
 
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
of motorcycles to engage us Behavior to
 
01:33:20.109 --> 01:33:20.119 align:start position:0%
choose whether or not to engage in that
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
behavior as is their right um and almost
 
01:33:26.109 --> 01:33:26.119 align:start position:0%
the ENT ire world and I can say this
 
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
from having just this past year ridden
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
across a significant piece of Europe um
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
Poland Italy France honestly if there
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't Lane filtering in most of those
 
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
countries especially in the cities the
 
01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
traffic would never move because such a
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
large percentage of the population uh
 
01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
rides on two wheels that it's the only
 
01:33:50.109 --> 01:33:50.119 align:start position:0%
way to mitigate the traffic this is also
 
01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
true southeast Asia and a large part of
 
01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
South America so most of the world
 
01:33:58.149 --> 01:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
recognizes Lane filtering at slower
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
stopped traffic as just proper traffic
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
management and the reason it's proper
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
traffic management is because
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
motorcycles because of their power to
 
01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
weight ratio have acceleration
 
01:34:12.910 --> 01:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
capabilities better than pretty much any
 
01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
consumer produced automobile that is
 
01:34:19.229 --> 01:34:19.239 align:start position:0%
available um and so if you're in traffic
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
you want all the vehicles to get out of
 
01:34:23.070 --> 01:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
that traffic as quickly as possible and
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
motorcycles are doing that by getting
 
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
themselves out of traffic they can only
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
do that if they can get up to the front
 
01:34:30.510 --> 01:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
line the particular legislation here is
 
01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:35.830 align:start position:0%
line the particular legislation here is
based

01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
based
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
on Colorado I think Colorado's language
 
01:34:41.310 --> 01:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
but I added in Minnesota's education
 
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
piece and protection um against
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
aggressive automobile behavior and I'll
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
get into um that so I just mentioned
 
01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
that traffic flow is one of the biggest
 
01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:54.149 align:start position:0%
that traffic flow is one of the biggest
reasons

01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
one of it's not the biggest reason for
 
01:34:59.070 --> 01:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
this uh another reason which is not the
 
01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
biggest reason is to protect
 
01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists who are sitting on a
 
01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
combustion engine usually in summer
 
01:35:09.189 --> 01:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
weather in traffic usually wearing full
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
gear so motorcyclists can easily become
 
01:35:14.189 --> 01:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
overheated and their motorcycles which
 
01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
do not have the kind of cooling systems
 
01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
that cars have can also become
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
overheated so allowing them to leave
 
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
traffic sooner helps with that but
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
that's also not the biggest reason to
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
allow this the biggest reason to allow
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
this is because a motorcycle sitting
 
01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
behind and I think anyone here who's
 
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
ridden knows this problem very well
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
sitting behind at a stoplight behind a
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
full automobile does not add to that
 
01:35:43.229 --> 01:35:43.239 align:start position:0%
silhouette and a person approaching you
 
01:35:47.070 --> 01:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
from behind doesn't necessarily see that
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
you are closer to them than the
 
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
silhouette that they see which is the
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
rear end of the car in front of you
 
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
which means that motor M cyclists are at
 
01:35:57.390 --> 01:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
a huge risk of rearin collisions when
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
they are sitting in traffic as they are
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
legally required to do
 
01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
currently and those rear end collisions
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
are incredibly fatal in fact one of um
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
not just fatal but can result in other
 
01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
severe injuries one of the um people who
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
I think has reached out to you or will
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
reach out to you is the person who made
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
this bill um become law in
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
Minnesota and the he was he's either the
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
president or high up in the BMW
 
01:36:27.629 --> 01:36:27.639 align:start position:0%
motorcycle um Owners
 
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
Association and he had his wife on the
 
01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
back of his BMW sitting as he was
 
01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
legally supposed to do in traffic and
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
got rear ended as frequently happens and
 
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
his wife um lost use of her legs I don't
 
01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
know if it was temporary or or permanent
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
but um a very very severe injury um and
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
that spurred him to get this law passed
 
01:36:47.679 --> 01:36:49.149 align:start position:0%
that spurred him to get this law passed
in

01:36:49.149 --> 01:36:49.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:36:52.229 --> 01:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
Minnesota so that safety and very
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
specifically the option the option to
 
01:36:57.390 --> 01:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
choose the safer um option on the road
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
for the motorcyclist this is the Live
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
Free or Die State I know we can all come
 
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
up with examples where we don't
 
01:37:06.109 --> 01:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily think that is true but we
 
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
don't have helmet law in this state we
 
01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
don't have seat belt law in this state
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
and for some reason we are requiring
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists to engage in a more
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
dangerous Behavior now if a particular
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
motorcyclist maybe somebody who isn't as
 
01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
experienced is afraid of going in
 
01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
between the vehicles that's their option
 
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
they can sit they can stand or sit
 
01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
behind a car that's fine this is about
 
01:37:29.790 --> 01:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
the right to make the choice for what is
 
01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
in your best interest I will say that if
 
01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
you never practice going in between
 
01:37:38.830 --> 01:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
Vehicles you are denying yourself a very
 
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
necessary skill because there will be
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
times in traffic again anyone who spent
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
significant time on two wheels knows
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
there will be times in traffic that you
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
have to react quickly and you have to
 
01:37:51.390 --> 01:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
maneuver in a tight situation so if you
 
01:37:54.910 --> 01:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
never do that you are a worse road
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
hazard than when you get the experience
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
to actually do that and this is you can
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
watch videos of European Riders South uh
 
01:38:06.629 --> 01:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
Asian Riders riding and you would be
 
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
surprised at the the ride skill that
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
they have because we just don't practice
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
those skills
 
01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
here so the specifics of when this is
 
01:38:21.149 --> 01:38:21.159 align:start position:0%
allowed in the bill um
 
01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
any traffic that's traveling less than
 
01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
10 m an hour for a vehicle that has two
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
wheels on the ground so this is
 
01:38:30.270 --> 01:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
important this is not a trike this is
 
01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
not a spider this is not a motorcycle
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
with a side car this is very
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
specifically a two- wheeled
 
01:38:39.870 --> 01:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle um in contact with the ground so
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
like if you had a spare mounted that
 
01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
would be different but also you can't do
 
01:38:45.629 --> 01:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
a wheelie while you're Lane
 
01:38:48.430 --> 01:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
filtering um Can overtake in between
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
lanes so not on shoulders but in between
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
lanes uh if the traffic is traveling at
 
01:38:57.229 --> 01:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
less than 10 m an hour and as long as
 
01:38:59.870 --> 01:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
the motorcycle is going 20 M an hour or
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
less so that speed differential is
 
01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:04.679 align:start position:0%
really important that's a a 10 m hour
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
speed differential there are Studies by
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
dot Studies by UC Berkeley um multiple
 
01:39:13.470 --> 01:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
studies that have shown not there also
 
01:39:15.070 --> 01:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
other studies that show that sitting
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
behind as a motorcycle sitting behind a
 
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
c uh the stop light is a huge rear and
 
01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
collision risk which I failed to mention
 
01:39:24.189 --> 01:39:24.199 align:start position:0%
earlier but there are studies that show
 
01:39:26.669 --> 01:39:26.679 align:start position:0%
that as much as we continually say in
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
it's popular narrative that speed kills
 
01:39:32.109 --> 01:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
which is true or your overall speed is a
 
01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
is the number one um risk factor it's
 
01:39:38.189 --> 01:39:38.199 align:start position:0%
actually not overall speed yes speed is
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
a factor especially given the road
 
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
you're on and and other things but the
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
speed differential in most cases when
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about vehicle and vehicle
 
01:39:48.669 --> 01:39:48.679 align:start position:0%
collision speed differential and this is
 
01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
from these studies is the most important
 
01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
factor in a collision so so and so much
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
so that they actually have an exact
 
01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
number 15 M an hour speed differential
 
01:40:03.149 --> 01:40:03.159 align:start position:0%
is where things get dangerous and you
 
01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
are more likely to cause a traffic
 
01:40:07.709 --> 01:40:07.719 align:start position:0%
Hazard or a a risk of collision if
 
01:40:11.070 --> 01:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
you're going slower on that slow side so
 
01:40:13.229 --> 01:40:13.239 align:start position:0%
if you are going 15 mil an hour slower
 
01:40:16.030 --> 01:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
than traffic is even if traffic is going
 
01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
20 miles an hour over the speed limit if
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
you're going 50 m hour or more slower
 
01:40:23.470 --> 01:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
you are creating the risk more so than
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
if you're going 15 miles an hour faster
 
01:40:27.870 --> 01:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
than traffic but the goal is to get
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
everybody within that same 15 mph window
 
01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:33.719 align:start position:0%
because that is where collisions don't
 
01:40:37.229 --> 01:40:37.239 align:start position:0%
typically happen so this is a 10 m an
 
01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:38.719 align:start position:0%
hour speed
 
01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
differential but I want to bring up
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
because one of the big um arguments will
 
01:40:46.350 --> 01:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
be something along the lines of you know
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
well you could potentially if it's
 
01:40:50.709 --> 01:40:50.719 align:start position:0%
narrow you could potentially hit uh
 
01:40:54.109 --> 01:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
Vehicles as you're going in between
 
01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
um that's true anytime you operate any
 
01:40:59.149 --> 01:40:59.159 align:start position:0%
kind of vehicle you need to know the
 
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
width of your vehicle and while safety
 
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
for cars or advancements in safety for
 
01:41:08.790 --> 01:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
cars focuses on the engineering aspect
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
of cars you know creating crumple zones
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
and better frames and airbags and what
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
have you safety for
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
motorcycles really is all on the rider
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
anyone who rides motorcycles knows that
 
01:41:23.709 --> 01:41:23.719 align:start position:0%
they are taking on all the risk and they
 
01:41:26.109 --> 01:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
have to drive defensively because if
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
there is a problem and when you're in an
 
01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:29.679 align:start position:0%
accident on a motorcycle you are 30
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
times more likely to die from that
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:37.390 --> 01:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
car so you need to know how wide your
 
01:41:39.149 --> 01:41:39.159 align:start position:0%
vehicle is no matter what you're driving
 
01:41:40.589 --> 01:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
you need to know whether or not you can
 
01:41:42.990 --> 01:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
fit in whatever area you're driving into
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
no matter what you're
 
01:41:46.709 --> 01:41:46.719 align:start position:0%
driving um and you're taking on that
 
01:41:48.109 --> 01:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
risk as a person who's operating a
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle so that's true across the board
 
01:41:51.629 --> 01:41:51.639 align:start position:0%
but what I will say is that if you're
 
01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
sitting behind a vehic vehicle and you
 
01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
are uh about to be rear ended that is a
 
01:41:59.910 --> 01:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
much worse Collision than if you go in
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
between lanes and you tap a mirror and
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
it's like 95% of all of those Lan
 
01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
filtering incidents are mirror Taps and
 
01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
all that results of it is having to
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
readjust your mirrors so that's not to
 
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
say that other things can't happen but
 
01:42:15.870 --> 01:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
that's the vast majority and I would
 
01:42:18.109 --> 01:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
much rather be all day long every day in
 
01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
a mirror tap incident than a rear end
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
okay so I think I am on to uh the
 
01:42:31.149 --> 01:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
education piece this was borrowed out of
 
01:42:31.159 --> 01:42:32.390 align:start position:0%
education piece this was borrowed out of
Minnesota's

01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
Minnesota's
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
language um I think that's kind of
 
01:42:37.870 --> 01:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory um education for both
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
the motorcyclist in our um training but
 
01:42:44.109 --> 01:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
also I think education for car drivers
 
01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
because I think anyone who's ridden
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
motorcycles knows that there are
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
aggressive cars people who just really
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
hate motorcycles and have done things
 
01:42:55.870 --> 01:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
intentionally to risk motorcyclist lives
 
01:42:57.070 --> 01:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
that is something that we deal with
 
01:42:59.390 --> 01:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
that's a risk that we take on is being
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
aware and being able to evade those um
 
01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
so the question one of the questions
 
01:43:06.589 --> 01:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
that um about this bill is well drivers
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
are just going to be mad that these
 
01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:11.320 align:start position:0%
motorcycles are passing them and coming
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
up to the front of the line and you know
 
01:43:16.830 --> 01:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
yeah there probably will be a few mad
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
drivers at first and that's why there's
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
an education to let people know it's
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
legal but again this is the law of the
 
01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
land pretty much everywhere else in the
 
01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
world and drivers are okay with it they
 
01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
get used to it it's weird in this
 
01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
country that we kind of approach driving
 
01:43:36.629 --> 01:43:36.639 align:start position:0%
from this kind of
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
individualistic um it's my turn it's
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
your turn perspective rather than what's
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of traffic flow
 
01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
perspective and that's something that
 
01:43:47.189 --> 01:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
the rest of the world kind of emphasizes
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
but eventually it will be
 
01:43:52.189 --> 01:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
normalized um and that's part of why the
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
education now I $110,000 is is10 to
 
01:43:57.149 --> 01:43:57.159 align:start position:0%
$100,000 is in the fiscal Noe is
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
possible for that education I don't see
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
how um maybe adding a little tiny
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
segment to motorcycle education and then
 
01:44:08.430 --> 01:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
doing maybe a press release social media
 
01:44:11.229 --> 01:44:11.239 align:start position:0%
release and maybe some LED signs would
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
exceed $10,000 but I'm sure that there
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
are people here who will be eager to
 
01:44:20.910 --> 01:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:24.109 --> 01:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
be and I guess I'm just going to close
 
01:44:27.070 --> 01:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
with um the idea
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
that I think a lot of times we all not
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
just in this building but in our lives
 
01:44:35.709 --> 01:44:35.719 align:start position:0%
make decisions based on feeling rather
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
than fact and there's definitely a
 
01:44:39.589 --> 01:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
feeling there's General feelings I think
 
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
for all of us that we're reticent to
 
01:44:43.229 --> 01:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
change we like things the way they are
 
01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
we're used to that um and there's also
 
01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
the feeling that there's this stereotype
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the motorcyclist that is this young
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
typically male kind of Reckless Rider
 
01:44:58.270 --> 01:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
the majority of writers are not young
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
and not Reckless they're usually
 
01:45:01.229 --> 01:45:01.239 align:start position:0%
middle-aged and they've chosen
 
01:45:04.030 --> 01:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
motorcycles because it's a more cost
 
01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
efficient time efficient and fuele
 
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
efficient way to get between their
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
locations that they need to commute and
 
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
they're willing to take on um the cost
 
01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.719 align:start position:0%
which is increased risk to themselves
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
that's most Riders and I would like to
 
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
say that female writers are the fastest
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
growing demographic in m cycle riding um
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
so there is this emotional thing like oh
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a bunch of
 
01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:28.990 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a bunch of
halfhazard

01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
halfhazard
 
01:45:31.229 --> 01:45:31.239 align:start position:0%
aggressive Riders but that's actually
 
01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
not true most of the motorcyclists are
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
actually responsible and have very
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
knowingly and conscientiously taken on
 
01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
these risks and understand how to engage
 
01:45:41.709 --> 01:45:41.719 align:start position:0%
in risk
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
management and um I just think that
 
01:45:46.470 --> 01:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
given that there's study after study
 
01:45:48.030 --> 01:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
that shows that this is a danger to
 
01:45:49.950 --> 01:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
motorcyclist and that we are in the lify
 
01:45:51.709 --> 01:45:51.719 align:start position:0%
OR dice State it's only the right thing
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
to do to join the multiple States and
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
most of the world in allowing
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
motorcyclist to make that decision for
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
themselves as to what is in the best
 
01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:02.199 align:start position:0%
interest of their safety and with that
 
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take
 
01:46:06.910 --> 01:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
 
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
G thank you Mr chair thank you uh
 
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative Reed so as of right now
 
01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.639 align:start position:0%
when I am on my motorcycle and I come in
 
01:46:18.990 --> 01:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
to stop traffic you know I I don't want
 
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
to get sandwiched any more than anybody
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
else that's one of the uh that's
 
01:46:22.990 --> 01:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
actually one of my only fears on a bike
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
I have no fear on a bike except for
 
01:46:24.239 --> 01:46:24.950 align:start position:0%
I have no fear on a bike except for
getting

01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
sandwiched um right now I will pull out
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
and I could get cited for failure to uh
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
maintain a singular Lane of traffic for
 
01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
pulling out of the flow as the only
 
01:46:36.750 --> 01:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
option to getting rear ended now if I
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
pull far enough to the edge of a lane I
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
have had cars come up and try to
 
01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
encroach me off the lane this bill would
 
01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
give me the option to at safe speeds not
 
01:46:48.430 --> 01:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
only get out of in between the vehicles
 
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
but also filter to a safe location
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's the next turn or this front
 
01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
of the line correct that's absolutely
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
correct representative and I'm thank you
 
01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
for pointing out that I failed to
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
mention that based on Minnesota law this
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
does make illegal the Hostile behavior
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
of intentionally blocking a motorcycle
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
that is trying to Lane filter um
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
currently you could be cited if you
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
engaged in the safest behavior and again
 
01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
riding a motorcycle while you and I both
 
01:47:16.510 --> 01:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
consider it to be fun um is a service to
 
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
society you are saving emissions you are
 
01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
saving on traffic you're saving on
 
01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
parking you're doing a service so much
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
so that a lot of other countries and a
 
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
lot of States reward motorcyclists by
 
01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
with close parking um with uh lower
 
01:47:34.589 --> 01:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
tolls with use of the HOV lane um so we
 
01:47:36.589 --> 01:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
reward this Behavior that's helping with
 
01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
our traffic problems so why would we
 
01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
penalize motorcyclists when they're just
 
01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
trying to do what is
 
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
safest and quick follow up follow up and
 
01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:49.639 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in this bill that
 
01:47:51.310 --> 01:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
mandates me doing this you've seen my
 
01:47:52.470 --> 01:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
bikes and I have couple that are a
 
01:47:53.589 --> 01:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
wider and I would not be comfortable
 
01:47:56.189 --> 01:47:56.199 align:start position:0%
doing that with them there's nothing
 
01:47:58.709 --> 01:47:58.719 align:start position:0%
that mandates that I use this right if
 
01:48:02.589 --> 01:48:02.599 align:start position:0%
you had a big fat boy with big giant
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
saddle bags or what have you um you
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
don't have to do it there's nothing this
 
01:48:12.430 --> 01:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
is just a motorcyclist rights
 
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
issue any other questions from the
 
01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
committee represent Miller uh thank you
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:48:22.109 --> 01:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
question um you mentioned at one point
 
01:48:24.910 --> 01:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
sort of clear traffic and I have been in
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
Southeast Asia and see all the
 
01:48:27.550 --> 01:48:27.560 align:start position:0%
motorcycles come up and they sort of end
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
up in the crosswalk if they bother to
 
01:48:32.350 --> 01:48:32.360 align:start position:0%
stop so um but when the light changes
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
they go and everybody goes out behind
 
01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
the cars go out behind them I've seen
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
that happen I understand that our roads
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
I feel like don't necessarily have a
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
space at the front of the front of the
 
01:48:44.189 --> 01:48:44.199 align:start position:0%
line behind the intersection behind the
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
crosswalk for motorcycles to stop or
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
other two whe vehicles to stop is there
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
a situation where you're going to have
 
01:48:51.870 --> 01:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
you know sort of two vehicles next to
 
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
each other trying to figure out who goes
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
first and how that gets sorted or how do
 
01:48:58.189 --> 01:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
you see that playing out and from a
 
01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
safety perspective mostly so I can
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
guarantee you and I think rep gon's
 
01:49:04.669 --> 01:49:04.679 align:start position:0%
going to back me up on this one um if
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's a motorcycle stopped at the same
 
01:49:10.030 --> 01:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
line as a car that motorcycle's going
 
01:49:12.189 --> 01:49:12.199 align:start position:0%
first there's no question we can
 
01:49:14.430 --> 01:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
accelerate faster than you could ever
 
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
dream of unless you have the highest end
 
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
race car and I have maybe a not great
 
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
bike that's the only way that that the
 
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
car is going to win that that battle
 
01:49:27.070 --> 01:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
having said that you do bring up a good
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
point which is a lot of communities
 
01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
elsewhere have created these specific
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
zones because such a large percentage of
 
01:49:36.030 --> 01:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
their population rides on two wheels we
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
don't have that high of a percentage of
 
01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:39.560 align:start position:0%
population if you're at a stoplight
 
01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
currently you don't see unless it's
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
maybe the height of Like Bike Week
 
01:49:46.430 --> 01:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
season you don't see dozens of two-
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
wheeled Vehicles waiting at that
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
stoplight um having said that there's
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
nothing preventing any community that
 
01:49:54.350 --> 01:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
has jurisdiction of whatever that road
 
01:49:56.910 --> 01:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
is whether it's a Town Road or or state
 
01:49:58.830 --> 01:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
from creating those zones at
 
01:50:01.149 --> 01:50:01.159 align:start position:0%
intersections to allow like kind of the
 
01:50:03.310 --> 01:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
parking space for them in the front of
 
01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
the line but typically you're going to
 
01:50:07.629 --> 01:50:07.639 align:start position:0%
see Matt most maybe one bike at a
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
stoplight and that bike will be nose to
 
01:50:12.750 --> 01:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
noose with the car next to it and the
 
01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
bike will get in front and the if the if
 
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
the car driver is upset about that it's
 
01:50:19.589 --> 01:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
not a problem because they'll forget all
 
01:50:23.790 --> 01:50:23.800 align:start position:0%
about that bike in about 5 Seconds
 
01:50:25.589 --> 01:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
representative foot thank you Mr
 
01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:27.800 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative Reed
 
01:50:29.950 --> 01:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
do we know in those States the 17 states
 
01:50:32.350 --> 01:50:32.360 align:start position:0%
where this is legal is there any studies
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
or um statistics about any increased
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
accidents with vehicles doing this
 
01:50:40.109 --> 01:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
because I know it's a big education
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
component to this with riders and
 
01:50:45.589 --> 01:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
regular Vehicle drivers so is there any
 
01:50:47.709 --> 01:50:47.719 align:start position:0%
uptick and accidents when this first
 
01:50:50.430 --> 01:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
gets initiated or I have the person who
 
01:50:51.870 --> 01:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
may or may not have reached out to you
 
01:50:54.189 --> 01:50:54.199 align:start position:0%
already um um who has that information
 
01:50:56.830 --> 01:50:56.840 align:start position:0%
for you um I don't know if it's been in
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
all of those states where it's so 12 of
 
01:51:03.709 --> 01:51:03.719 align:start position:0%
the states 11 of the states it's just
 
01:51:05.589 --> 01:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
legal because there's no law that speaks
 
01:51:08.830 --> 01:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
to it and six of them have proactively
 
01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:11.560 align:start position:0%
made it a behavior for motorcyclists to
 
01:51:16.109 --> 01:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
engage in um so um I'm happy to get that
 
01:51:18.069 --> 01:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
information from that person or anywhere
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
else and send it along to the committee
 
01:51:22.069 --> 01:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
having said that once again those
 
01:51:24.589 --> 01:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
accidents are going to be mirror taps or
 
01:51:27.310 --> 01:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
very slow speed side swipes which is so
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
much better so much better than a rear
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
end at 20 30 miles an
 
01:51:36.189 --> 01:51:36.199 align:start position:0%
hour further questions from the
 
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
committee I'll ask one myself statistics
 
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
wise uh because I'm obviously concerned
 
01:51:43.950 --> 01:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
about motorcycle safety as well I got
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
you beat by a few years on the roads but
 
01:51:49.069 --> 01:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
um how many but also how many years
 
01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
you've been on the planet so maybe I'll
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
catch up to you um how many how many uh
 
01:51:56.189 --> 01:51:56.199 align:start position:0%
incidents a year are we looking at for
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
fatalities or or actually reun
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
collisions of fatalities in the H do you
 
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
know once again that person who I just
 
01:52:05.069 --> 01:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
cited has compiled all these statistics
 
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy I don't have a a specific
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
but I think the most important thing is
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
not the overall number it's the
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
percentage likelihood a motorcycle will
 
01:52:16.069 --> 01:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
be rear ended at a stoplight versus a a
 
01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
car because cars get rear-ended at stop
 
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
lights too right motorcycles are more
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
likely to be rear-ended and I can get
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
the data that shows you how much more
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
likely they are that would be
 
01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
helpful um and I was hoping there'd be
 
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
somebody from the do here only the
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
actual definition itself uh because it
 
01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
does specify in line nine that we're
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
only talking about passing or overtaking
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
in the same Lane do you have any idea
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
because I don't have a DOT person here
 
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
how wide the average Lane is in New
 
01:52:46.709 --> 01:52:46.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire versus how wide the normal
 
01:52:48.910 --> 01:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle is or average vehicle in other
 
01:52:50.310 --> 01:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
words if you do the subtraction there's
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
not much left there it depends on on
 
01:52:55.629 --> 01:52:55.639 align:start position:0%
what road you're on so Highway lanes are
 
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
far wider than um a lot of like say town
 
01:53:03.550 --> 01:53:03.560 align:start position:0%
roads uh the maximum width of a vehicle
 
01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
I can tell you from being CDL for 13
 
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
years or 14 years whatever is 8 and a
 
01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
half feet so a lane typically is like at
 
01:53:15.189 --> 01:53:15.199 align:start position:0%
least 10 feet wide um but you know there
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
may be some very very small roads in
 
01:53:20.069 --> 01:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
some very rural back areas that are
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
slightly more narrow I don't know what
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
the actual minimum is and there's
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
certainly Highway lanes that are far
 
01:53:28.030 --> 01:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
wider um having said that once again if
 
01:53:30.589 --> 01:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
you are the operator of any vehicle it
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
is on you your responsibility to know
 
01:53:35.149 --> 01:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
how wide your vehicle is and if it can
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
fit where you're about to put it that's
 
01:53:40.990 --> 01:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
true of a car a bus uh anything and so
 
01:53:42.669 --> 01:53:42.679 align:start position:0%
you are taking on that responsibility
 
01:53:45.189 --> 01:53:45.199 align:start position:0%
and I will just add that unlike in a car
 
01:53:48.350 --> 01:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
or an SUV or a truck or whatever I can
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
maybe not on the fat boy but I can look
 
01:53:53.229 --> 01:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
all around me and see exact exactly how
 
01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
wide my vehicle is which is something I
 
01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
don't get to do in a truck or a bus
 
01:53:59.310 --> 01:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
right so I can see yeah no I'm
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
definitely not going to fit um but as a
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
motorcyclist you're taking on that risk
 
01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
it the damage is on you so I just said
 
01:54:11.950 --> 01:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
car versus motorcycle at a stoplight
 
01:54:14.270 --> 01:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
motorcycle wins every single time the
 
01:54:16.750 --> 01:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
downside the risk we all take on is car
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
versus motorcycle in a collision the car
 
01:54:24.069 --> 01:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
wins every single time that's the
 
01:54:26.669 --> 01:54:26.679 align:start position:0%
tradeoff anybody else from the committee
 
01:54:30.189 --> 01:54:30.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank so
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:38.189 --> 01:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
here next up chair recognize Dan Bennett
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
H Auto Dealers Association opposed to
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:50.669 --> 01:54:50.679 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chairman members of
 
01:54:52.030 --> 01:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
the committee I'll do my best to be
 
01:54:54.069 --> 01:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
brief better than the last time again
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
Dan Bennett New Hampshire Auto Dealers
 
01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
Association uh trade Association
 
01:54:59.470 --> 01:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
represent the motor vehicle industry um
 
01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
including multiple motorcycle and Power
 
01:55:04.229 --> 01:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
Sports members um as I mentioned before
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
and you've heard me say before uh safe
 
01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
roads is a Cornerstone issue for New
 
01:55:09.790 --> 01:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Auto Dealers Association we're
 
01:55:11.310 --> 01:55:11.320 align:start position:0%
a member of the New Hampshire Traffic
 
01:55:13.030 --> 01:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
Safety commission we're a member of the
 
01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:14.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire motorcycle safety task
 
01:55:16.990 --> 01:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
force um and you've often heard us be a
 
01:55:18.669 --> 01:55:18.679 align:start position:0%
roadway safety Advocate on issues
 
01:55:21.470 --> 01:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's um inspections like before
 
01:55:23.669 --> 01:55:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh the texting B B while driving U
 
01:55:26.589 --> 01:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
motorcycle rider education um and uh
 
01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
driver's education for young young
 
01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:30.639 align:start position:0%
children who um may be in need and need
 
01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
a scholarship we with a few of our
 
01:55:34.069 --> 01:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
partners help administer a program to
 
01:55:35.910 --> 01:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
help kid more kids get into driver's ed
 
01:55:37.709 --> 01:55:37.719 align:start position:0%
so again roadway safety is an important
 
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
issue for us um it's our opinion uh that
 
01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
Laden filtering at any speed is not
 
01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate for New Hampshire um there's
 
01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
going to be a huge driver and operator
 
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
um education curve um with this type of
 
01:55:54.669 --> 01:55:54.679 align:start position:0%
issue both classroom and experiential um
 
01:55:57.470 --> 01:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
if you've ever been um had it happen to
 
01:55:59.390 --> 01:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
you especially at high speeds it can be
 
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
rather jarring um when someone overtakes
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
you um acknowledging that this is done
 
01:56:06.669 --> 01:56:06.679 align:start position:0%
at the lower speed that we heard the
 
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
references to um to other places you
 
01:56:11.229 --> 01:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
know the congestion that we experience
 
01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is not California and
 
01:56:15.149 --> 01:56:15.159 align:start position:0%
New York um it is not southeast Asia and
 
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
it is not European cities either uh 10 m
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
hour on 93 or 101 uh does not really
 
01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
happen all that frequent ly um so um as
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned um and you've heard us before
 
01:56:30.030 --> 01:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
recent data shows whether it's
 
01:56:31.950 --> 01:56:31.960 align:start position:0%
impairment whether it's
 
01:56:34.189 --> 01:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
distraction um whether it's excessive
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
speeds which if we we've seen records of
 
01:56:39.149 --> 01:56:39.159 align:start position:0%
excessive speeds um over the past uh
 
01:56:42.310 --> 01:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
year and summer especially um and
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
Mechanicals U it's it's just our opinion
 
01:56:48.069 --> 01:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
this is not the right time uh to pass a
 
01:56:51.189 --> 01:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
law that potentially uh could risk the
 
01:56:54.109 --> 01:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
roads being um unsafe a little more
 
01:56:56.229 --> 01:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
unsafe leading to accidents or
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
potentially even worse so um with that
 
01:57:01.550 --> 01:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
being said uh Mr chairman uh that's all
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
I have to offer on this particular
 
01:57:05.310 --> 01:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you very much
 
01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
thank you again thank you Mr chair
 
01:57:11.629 --> 01:57:11.639 align:start position:0%
members next up chair recognizes Tracy
 
01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
bourage representative the hire
 
01:57:14.709 --> 01:57:14.719 align:start position:0%
motorcycle rights
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
organization opposed to the bill and I
 
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
have written testimony and written
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
so I stated before um just to remind you
 
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
again I I represent motorcyclist across
 
01:57:41.669 --> 01:57:41.679 align:start position:0%
the board in this state as the president
 
01:57:43.629 --> 01:57:43.639 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire motorcycle rights the
 
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
traffic and safety commission I chair
 
01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
the task force and I sit on the national
 
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
board for motorcyclist so I'm very
 
01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
involved very engaged and very aware of
 
01:57:56.950 --> 01:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
motorcycling and what's going on in this
 
01:57:59.629 --> 01:57:59.639 align:start position:0%
country um I have been riding since I
 
01:58:02.069 --> 01:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
was 4 years old and I am older than she
 
01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
is so longer than Miss Ellen
 
01:58:08.589 --> 01:58:08.599 align:start position:0%
Reed we are here to oppose this bill and
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
obviously I represent the rights
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
organization we do believe in the rights
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
but it's a privilege to be on our roads
 
01:58:19.310 --> 01:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
there's some things I want to um to
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
express as to why we feel that this is
 
01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
an issue the first being the potential
 
01:58:27.790 --> 01:58:27.800 align:start position:0%
impact of impaired Reckless and
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
distracted motor vehicle operators not
 
01:58:33.030 --> 01:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
knowing or
 
01:58:35.550 --> 01:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
understanding the legality of authorized
 
01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
Lane filtering by
 
01:58:39.310 --> 01:58:39.320 align:start position:0%
motorcyclist the second is given the
 
01:58:41.189 --> 01:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
number of OU ofate motor vehicle
 
01:58:43.350 --> 01:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
operators that we have that come in that
 
01:58:46.709 --> 01:58:46.719 align:start position:0%
may not understand that we have this law
 
01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
if we put this through the third uh
 
01:58:53.550 --> 01:58:53.560 align:start position:0%
representative Reed mentioned $10,000 to
 
01:58:56.550 --> 01:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
$100,000 having worked with the state on
 
01:58:58.470 --> 01:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
the motorcycle rights or the motorcycle
 
01:59:00.430 --> 01:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
funds that we do receive for the task
 
01:59:03.390 --> 01:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
force I can tell you to implement this
 
01:59:05.870 --> 01:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
it will not be $110,000 we can spend
 
01:59:06.750 --> 01:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
that on
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
PSA for just the Riding community in in
 
01:59:13.950 --> 01:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
just one riding season easily so knowing
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
that where is that cost going to come
 
01:59:18.189 --> 01:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
from and given in the year where the
 
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
budget is being cut I doubt that we're
 
01:59:23.790 --> 01:59:23.800 align:start position:0%
going to get that kind of money for this
 
01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
I also want to let you know that most
 
01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists uh and it took me a while
 
01:59:29.910 --> 01:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
to understand too because we don't do it
 
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
and while I agree that it's happening in
 
01:59:34.270 --> 01:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
Europe there are a lot more riders in
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
Europe that ride motorcycles it's very
 
01:59:40.589 --> 01:59:40.599 align:start position:0%
common in our states most places we see
 
01:59:42.270 --> 01:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of riders but it's still not a
 
01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
common place for us compared to the
 
01:59:45.990 --> 01:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
amount of vehicles on the
 
01:59:49.109 --> 01:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
road motorcyclists most of them
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
themselves do not understand what lane
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
splitting or Lane filtering is and the
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
definition between the two in my
 
01:59:57.149 --> 01:59:57.159 align:start position:0%
testimony I don't want to get into all
 
01:59:59.870 --> 01:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
the details it does explain what is
 
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
generally accepted for filtering and for
 
02:00:04.589 --> 02:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
splitting but if they don't know the
 
02:00:06.270 --> 02:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
difference and yes there's an
 
02:00:08.830 --> 02:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
educational comp component but do you
 
02:00:10.069 --> 02:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
really think we're going to be able to
 
02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
get to every motorcyclist that's riding
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
in this community and to the motorist
 
02:00:16.030 --> 02:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
and explain to them that this is an
 
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
acceptable thing to do just this past
 
02:00:21.550 --> 02:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
season September I had two different
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
motorcyc CES do what I would call lane
 
02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
splitting at very high speeds down
 
02:00:30.510 --> 02:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
between the line one was a Harley full
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
dresser the other was what we call a
 
02:00:34.830 --> 02:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
crotch rocket and I can tell you in my
 
02:00:38.910 --> 02:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
car I was pissed off it's not and I'm a
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
writer it's not acceptable the other
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
thing I want to tell you is typically
 
02:00:46.229 --> 02:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
and you know she said this and this is
 
02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
on them but this is huge because I deal
 
02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
with this nationally the perception of
 
02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
motorcyclist from other vehicle
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
operators is not good and it's not
 
02:00:59.470 --> 02:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
because most of us are bad Riders it's
 
02:01:00.870 --> 02:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
not because most of us are popping the
 
02:01:02.149 --> 02:01:02.159 align:start position:0%
wheelies like what you're seeing out
 
02:01:05.910 --> 02:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
there on the roadways but motorcyclists
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
have a very negative
 
02:01:12.270 --> 02:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
negative feel for most other vehicle
 
02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
operators they think that we all are
 
02:01:16.990 --> 02:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
jerks and they think we all pop wheelies
 
02:01:20.830 --> 02:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
and Rod like jerks so given that again
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
how are we going to Ed educate in that
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
component and explain to these people
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
that we're not being a jerk because the
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
next side is going to be well if they
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
can do it why can't I we're not ask
 
02:01:33.229 --> 02:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
going to go down the breakdown Lane I
 
02:01:35.189 --> 02:01:35.199 align:start position:0%
realize that but that will be the next
 
02:01:37.229 --> 02:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
thing for other
 
02:01:37.239 --> 02:01:39.950 align:start position:0%
thing for other
vehicles

02:01:39.950 --> 02:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
the states that she mentioned you have
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
this in my testimony as well there are
 
02:01:47.149 --> 02:01:47.159 align:start position:0%
five states currently that have Lane
 
02:01:49.870 --> 02:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
filtering and in that you'll see if you
 
02:01:51.550 --> 02:01:51.560 align:start position:0%
look in my testimony I don't want to get
 
02:01:53.550 --> 02:01:53.560 align:start position:0%
into every one of them exactly what
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
their lanee filtering in that state
 
02:01:57.390 --> 02:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
allows and what it
 
02:02:00.189 --> 02:02:00.199 align:start position:0%
says those five states though are like
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
Arizona Utah Colorado Montana do those
 
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
States sound like anything like New
 
02:02:09.310 --> 02:02:09.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they've got roadways that
 
02:02:11.149 --> 02:02:11.159 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of people on them they
 
02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
do have congestion in some areas
 
02:02:15.550 --> 02:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
California lane splitting is legal it
 
02:02:17.790 --> 02:02:17.800 align:start position:0%
has been only legal fairly recently I
 
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
02:02:21.390 --> 02:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
2016 but California is a very different
 
02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:23.679 align:start position:0%
state than New Hampshire New Hampshire
 
02:02:25.350 --> 02:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
is not ready for this doesn't mean that
 
02:02:26.990 --> 02:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
it won't ever be doesn't mean that we
 
02:02:29.109 --> 02:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
won't have discussions in the future to
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
decide the other last thing that I'd
 
02:02:35.189 --> 02:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
like to bring up is cheering the task
 
02:02:37.310 --> 02:02:37.320 align:start position:0%
force the motorcycle task force and
 
02:02:38.910 --> 02:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
there are some very Heavy Hitters on
 
02:02:40.750 --> 02:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
that task force we have the department
 
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
of safety the Department of
 
02:02:45.790 --> 02:02:45.800 align:start position:0%
Transportation The Liquor Commission uh
 
02:02:47.830 --> 02:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
triaa uh New Hampshire Automobile
 
02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
Dealers Association Nitsa New Hampshire
 
02:02:52.270 --> 02:02:52.280 align:start position:0%
I mean uh the National Highway traffic
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
safety administration and the fars we
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
discuss a lot of this at length a lot of
 
02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
this and a big component is we get every
 
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
single week I personally get the data of
 
02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
what the crashes and fatalities are we
 
02:03:09.709 --> 02:03:09.719 align:start position:0%
are not being hit from behind and that's
 
02:03:12.830 --> 02:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
not to say that we can't ever be but we
 
02:03:14.350 --> 02:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
don't need to change something that's
 
02:03:16.750 --> 02:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
going to create more issues because we
 
02:03:19.229 --> 02:03:19.239 align:start position:0%
might be that to me is not an
 
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
intelligent decision for us to spend
 
02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
this money on
 
02:03:24.750 --> 02:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
and with that I will take any questions
 
02:03:26.910 --> 02:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
if you'd like but my testimony at the
 
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
very back if you will look to for those
 
02:03:31.030 --> 02:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
of you that don't know what it is shows
 
02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
you what that looks like if you're in
 
02:03:37.069 --> 02:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
cars and that is coming down between the
 
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
lanes for most people it's not going to
 
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
be an acceptable action that doesn't
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
again mean that I agree or disagree it's
 
02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
just I don't believe representing the
 
02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
motorcyclist in the state that this is
 
02:03:52.750 --> 02:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
the best thing for the state
 
02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
representative London thank you Mr chair
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony for my
 
02:04:01.470 --> 02:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
question I'm looking for some
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
clarification we've heard a lot of
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
02:04:07.790 --> 02:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
referencing motorcycles in Europe and
 
02:04:11.629 --> 02:04:11.639 align:start position:0%
Asia my understanding a lot of those are
 
02:04:14.069 --> 02:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
mopeds in those foreign countries a
 
02:04:17.229 --> 02:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
higher percentage and that that's a from
 
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
what I've seen legally and as I'm a
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
motorcycle rider and I've got mopeds
 
02:04:24.910 --> 02:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
they're totally different
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
Vehicles do you have any knowledge under
 
02:04:31.709 --> 02:04:31.719 align:start position:0%
this uh European and and Asian is it is
 
02:04:33.870 --> 02:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
it in fact an overwhelming amount of
 
02:04:36.910 --> 02:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
motorcycles or am I correct in assuming
 
02:04:39.470 --> 02:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
it's a mixture of mopeds and motorcycles
 
02:04:41.669 --> 02:04:41.679 align:start position:0%
it's a mixture I don't have the numbers
 
02:04:44.149 --> 02:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
um Larry Crow actually might be able to
 
02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:45.679 align:start position:0%
tell you that more because he races over
 
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
there when he
 
02:04:50.430 --> 02:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
testifies um but there are a lot smaller
 
02:04:52.069 --> 02:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
typically I mean in India they a lot
 
02:04:54.189 --> 02:04:54.199 align:start position:0%
smaller but but plenty of people over
 
02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
there ride big like she said fat boys
 
02:04:58.549 --> 02:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
and other types of motorcycles that are
 
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
full dressers um but a lot of those
 
02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
people that are riding in other
 
02:05:04.270 --> 02:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
countries are riding for a mode of
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
transportation in New Hampshire I can
 
02:05:08.149 --> 02:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
tell you that the BR of the people
 
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
riding we're riding because we're bikers
 
02:05:11.790 --> 02:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
we're not riding as a motor
 
02:05:14.350 --> 02:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
Transportation it's a way of life for us
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a lifestyle to ride a
 
02:05:19.390 --> 02:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
motorcycle thank you thank you Mr thank
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
you repres g
 
02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you ma'am so I
 
02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that I'm understanding
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
your testimony correct in
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
that you um you are concerned more about
 
02:05:36.750 --> 02:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
the culture being not ready causing an
 
02:05:39.229 --> 02:05:39.239 align:start position:0%
additional risk to the biker and that's
 
02:05:40.750 --> 02:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
that's your Prime reason for opposing
 
02:05:42.069 --> 02:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
this is that you don't feel that the
 
02:05:44.510 --> 02:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
culture is ready it's not anything other
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
than that is that correct no that's a
 
02:05:49.870 --> 02:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
huge component of it but I think too
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
anything that we do we have have to
 
02:05:55.950 --> 02:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
educate people correct and how again we
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
we have people we have motorcyclists
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
right now that are they're riding 160
 
02:06:03.669 --> 02:06:03.679 align:start position:0%
miles an hour we had two that were
 
02:06:06.109 --> 02:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
stopped this past year so we have
 
02:06:09.189 --> 02:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
motorcycles engaging in Behavior that's
 
02:06:12.430 --> 02:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
already illegal so we need to educate
 
02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
those Riders but we need to educate the
 
02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
the general public we're the general
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
public that doesn't know what a solid
 
02:06:21.709 --> 02:06:21.719 align:start position:0%
white lawn means how many of you have
 
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
been in with in other places that don't
 
02:06:25.950 --> 02:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
understand the solid white line so it's
 
02:06:27.709 --> 02:06:27.719 align:start position:0%
not that that's the biggest component
 
02:06:29.310 --> 02:06:29.320 align:start position:0%
but that is a component that we have to
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
think about and then we have to think
 
02:06:34.069 --> 02:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
about funding that and to educate all of
 
02:06:35.629 --> 02:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
these people and educate people coming
 
02:06:37.310 --> 02:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
into our state is a it's going to be a
 
02:06:39.790 --> 02:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
big issue and I don't think that we had
 
02:06:41.470 --> 02:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
somebody at the mall of hire what was it
 
02:06:43.149 --> 02:06:43.159 align:start position:0%
a year ago or two where it got cut off
 
02:06:45.709 --> 02:06:45.719 align:start position:0%
and he shot somebody I would prefer not
 
02:06:47.790 --> 02:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
to see motorcyclist having that issue
 
02:06:49.990 --> 02:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
and where we're not seeing the data if
 
02:06:52.189 --> 02:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
we were getting rear ended a
 
02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
obviously this would probably be a very
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
different discussion but we're not we're
 
02:06:59.189 --> 02:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
not being rear ended at a
 
02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
stoplight you know in droves in New
 
02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're just not so the
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
fatalities and the crashes aren't aren't
 
02:07:07.149 --> 02:07:07.159 align:start position:0%
showing us that we need to be talking
 
02:07:09.950 --> 02:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
about this and while I agree that there
 
02:07:12.830 --> 02:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
are top that we can be hit from behind
 
02:07:14.549 --> 02:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
we are we have to be responsible on our
 
02:07:16.709 --> 02:07:16.719 align:start position:0%
motorcycles to know what and where and
 
02:07:18.350 --> 02:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
how and what to
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
do thank you for your question
 
02:07:25.310 --> 02:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative pataro thank you Mr chair
 
02:07:28.030 --> 02:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for taking my question
 
02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
um could could you describe what the
 
02:07:32.229 --> 02:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
difference between splitting and
 
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
filtering is so I so if you look let me
 
02:07:37.950 --> 02:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
get to the page I'm and I'm going to
 
02:07:40.229 --> 02:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
read it only because again I happen not
 
02:07:43.069 --> 02:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
to not to do it okay have I ever done it
 
02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
yes one time lane splitting is generally
 
02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
defined as riding on a multi-lane
 
02:07:50.950 --> 02:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
highway such as a limited access freeway
 
02:07:53.870 --> 02:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
a motorc cyclist could split the lanes
 
02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
and ride between two vehicles if traffic
 
02:07:58.549 --> 02:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
is heavily congested or
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
stopped Lane filtering is generally
 
02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
defined as riding in multiple Lanes of
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
traffic where there are intersections
 
02:08:08.030 --> 02:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
and signals a motorcycles could filter
 
02:08:10.709 --> 02:08:10.719 align:start position:0%
between two rows a vehicle stopped at a
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
light allowing the motorcyclist to move
 
02:08:14.030 --> 02:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
to the front of the
 
02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
line but if you think about what those
 
02:08:18.910 --> 02:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
two things say how many people do you
 
02:08:21.629 --> 02:08:21.639 align:start position:0%
know are going to probably understand
 
02:08:26.549 --> 02:08:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:28.549 --> 02:08:28.559 align:start position:0%
splitting thank you for your question
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you that's great any other
 
02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
02:08:34.310 --> 02:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for your
 
02:08:35.910 --> 02:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
time and the opportunity to
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
speak next up chair recognizes Larry

Vehicle motorcycle rider
 
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
training no position taken on the
 
02:08:48.310 --> 02:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
bill good
 
02:08:51.109 --> 02:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon uh chairman
 
02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
Walsh and committee members um thank you
 
02:08:55.549 --> 02:08:55.559 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to speak um I am the
 
02:08:57.589 --> 02:08:57.599 align:start position:0%
state coordinator of the motorcycle
 
02:09:00.270 --> 02:09:00.280 align:start position:0%
rider education program which is at the
 
02:09:02.430 --> 02:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
division of motor vehicles um I'm not
 
02:09:04.830 --> 02:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
here to speak for or against but to
 
02:09:06.750 --> 02:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
provide any kind of information you may
 
02:09:09.549 --> 02:09:09.559 align:start position:0%
need um I have uh a couple areas that
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to speak to uh one thing that's
 
02:09:14.390 --> 02:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
been mentioned tremendously here is the
 
02:09:16.390 --> 02:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
educational component of putting any
 
02:09:20.270 --> 02:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
kind of uh law like this in place um so
 
02:09:22.229 --> 02:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
the uh motorcycle writer education
 
02:09:24.270 --> 02:09:24.280 align:start position:0%
program operates within the Division of
 
02:09:26.589 --> 02:09:26.599 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles it has been identified
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
within the bill as the entity to develop
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
the educational guidelines um where this
 
02:09:33.950 --> 02:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
bill to pass it would be of the utmost
 
02:09:36.109 --> 02:09:36.119 align:start position:0%
importance that the motor uh that the
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
motorcycling Community as well as the
 
02:09:40.390 --> 02:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
passenger vehicle community in general
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
fully understand what it means and what
 
02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
it does not mean for the continued safe
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
and legal operation of two- wheeled
 
02:09:52.030 --> 02:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles uh Lane filter does have
 
02:09:55.069 --> 02:09:55.079 align:start position:0%
the potential to be instituted very well
 
02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
it can also be instituted very poorly
 
02:10:00.310 --> 02:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
and education is the key difference
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
under the guidance of director morasco
 
02:10:04.950 --> 02:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh mrep motorcycle rider education
 
02:10:07.229 --> 02:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
program would be able to provide all the
 
02:10:10.109 --> 02:10:10.119 align:start position:0%
support requested as the primary program
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
in the state that provides information
 
02:10:14.430 --> 02:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
to the writing public and in particular
 
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
new writers we would need to devote
 
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
energy to fully understand the law is
 
02:10:21.790 --> 02:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
written and as it is written it's it is
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
um easily understood uh by the
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
program um and create an outreach
 
02:10:30.270 --> 02:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
program it would require training uh to
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
the instructor team to be able to impart
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
this information to the Riders as well
 
02:10:38.950 --> 02:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
as answer questions from the public um
 
02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
however the motorcycle rider education
 
02:10:43.629 --> 02:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
program itself only directly touches a
 
02:10:45.870 --> 02:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
small percentage of New Riders and
 
02:10:48.430 --> 02:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
reaches very little of the existing
 
02:10:50.310 --> 02:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle community in other words
 
02:10:52.030 --> 02:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
car drivers
 
02:10:53.950 --> 02:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
um who would be impacted by this
 
02:10:56.069 --> 02:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
legislation as such an effective
 
02:10:58.629 --> 02:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
Outreach campaign that reaches everyone
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
impacted would need to be created and
 
02:11:03.149 --> 02:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
implemented and this is likely to
 
02:11:06.109 --> 02:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
involve stakeholders from outside of the
 
02:11:09.549 --> 02:11:09.559 align:start position:0%
DMV and the motorcycle rider education
 
02:11:16.069 --> 02:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
program um uh I myself am a uh a rider I
 
02:11:19.270 --> 02:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
have um I annually ride in Europe as
 
02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
well as um I've ridden in um 48 of the
 
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
50 states you can probably guess which
 
02:11:27.310 --> 02:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
two I haven't made it to yet um uh I
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
lived in Los Angeles where I daily rode
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
my r100 RT BMW um and uh lane splitting
 
02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
was done regularly there I also um as I
 
02:11:43.549 --> 02:11:43.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned ride extensively in Europe uh
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
just last year um much to my wife's
 
02:11:49.109 --> 02:11:49.119 align:start position:0%
Chagrin who was sitting on the back of
 
02:11:52.589 --> 02:11:52.599 align:start position:0%
the bike I was laye filtering and Prague
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
um and I can tell you if I hadn't done
 
02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
that I would still be in Prague that
 
02:12:01.109 --> 02:12:01.119 align:start position:0%
being said um New Hampshire is um
 
02:12:05.310 --> 02:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a Prague yet so um uh it's
 
02:12:08.709 --> 02:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
up you know yes it is done do I wish um
 
02:12:11.069 --> 02:12:11.079 align:start position:0%
on a personal level that the United
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
States was um just blanket ready for
 
02:12:16.390 --> 02:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
this um and in particular in New
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the unintended consequences of
 
02:12:22.149 --> 02:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
potential road rage and um and other
 
02:12:24.189 --> 02:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
kind of crashes is something to be
 
02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
considered as you folks do make your
 
02:12:30.350 --> 02:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
decision um you know that being said uh
 
02:12:33.790 --> 02:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
the cost benefit analysis um would tend
 
02:12:36.669 --> 02:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
to be toward you know does New Hampshire
 
02:12:39.189 --> 02:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
need it um even though it's done well in
 
02:12:41.709 --> 02:12:41.719 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
um uh one one item would be um that uh
 
02:12:50.189 --> 02:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
it would have to have tremendous
 
02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
cooperation amongst everybody on the
 
02:12:56.109 --> 02:12:56.119 align:start position:0%
road um with an eye with the good for
 
02:13:00.270 --> 02:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
all not just the good for me um recent
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
behavior on the roads does indicate that
 
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
may not be what the current climate is
 
02:13:08.350 --> 02:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
out there in our roads um but I do hope
 
02:13:09.669 --> 02:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
that we get to the point where that
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
would happen and um you know lane
 
02:13:13.149 --> 02:13:13.159 align:start position:0%
splitting might make sense for New
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I'll end my testimony there
 
02:13:17.709 --> 02:13:17.719 align:start position:0%
and if you have any questions I will do
 
02:13:20.310 --> 02:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
my best to answer thank you sir any
 
02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:13:23.870 --> 02:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
Rimer uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
for your testimony uh you mentioned
 
02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
needing to get additional stakeholders
 
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
involved to develop an effective
 
02:13:31.990 --> 02:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
training program um do you think that is
 
02:13:34.669 --> 02:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
reasonable within the10 to $100,000
 
02:13:36.589 --> 02:13:36.599 align:start position:0%
budget that's been put in the fiscal
 
02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
note here or is this how broad is that
 
02:13:39.549 --> 02:13:39.559 align:start position:0%
going to be and where do you see that
 
02:13:40.910 --> 02:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
the spending
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
requirements that's hard to tell um some
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
of the external stakeholders would be
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
able to provide some funding we have um
 
02:13:51.149 --> 02:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
some great generous Partners in this
 
02:13:52.830 --> 02:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
State some of them are on the motorcycle
 
02:13:56.589 --> 02:13:56.599 align:start position:0%
task force which I am also part of um so
 
02:13:59.189 --> 02:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
that is difficult to say in that 10 to
 
02:14:03.189 --> 02:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
100,000 came from me um you know we
 
02:14:05.790 --> 02:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
can't I we are also a member of the
 
02:14:08.229 --> 02:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
State Motorcycle Safety Association
 
02:14:10.549 --> 02:14:10.559 align:start position:0%
where uh folks that are have the same
 
02:14:12.549 --> 02:14:12.559 align:start position:0%
position as I do Across the Nation
 
02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
regularly meet and uh the list of states
 
02:14:19.790 --> 02:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
um that Tracy provided I've spoke to
 
02:14:21.470 --> 02:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
almost every one of those folks that
 
02:14:24.470 --> 02:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
were required and implemented it in
 
02:14:26.510 --> 02:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
general um they have said that the
 
02:14:29.189 --> 02:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
educational component has proven to be
 
02:14:32.109 --> 02:14:32.119 align:start position:0%
very difficult um another thing in here
 
02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
I believe it has a um which is typically
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh the common U implemented 60-day after
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
signing um probably more time would be
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
needed um because of the
 
02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
creation um and also implementation of
 
02:14:50.350 --> 02:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
it education I cannot emphasize enough
 
02:14:52.750 --> 02:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
how important it is to do it well if
 
02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
this bill does pass did that answer your
 
02:14:58.350 --> 02:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
question sir yeah thank you very much
 
02:14:58.360 --> 02:14:59.430 align:start position:0%
question sir yeah thank you very much
anybody

02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
anybody

anybody
else

02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:05.189 --> 02:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
see well we're just asking questions you
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
can thank them afterwards uh seeing none
 
02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank
 
02:15:12.709 --> 02:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
you uh next up chair
 
02:15:14.750 --> 02:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
recognizes excuse
 
02:15:17.790 --> 02:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
me Matt Uchi from the Hampshire State
 
02:15:21.270 --> 02:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
Police in opposition to the bill
 
02:15:22.430 --> 02:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good afternoon sir
 
02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:23.950 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good afternoon sir
howo

02:15:23.950 --> 02:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
howo
 
02:15:27.709 --> 02:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
you so my name is mat mitui I'm with uh
 
02:15:29.390 --> 02:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Police and we're in
 
02:15:32.430 --> 02:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill um this bill
 
02:15:34.750 --> 02:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
will inevitably increase the amount of
 
02:15:37.589 --> 02:15:37.599 align:start position:0%
crashes that we see I'll give you some
 
02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
statistics that I have from the office
 
02:15:41.669 --> 02:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
of Highway Safety um that were posed
 
02:15:45.709 --> 02:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
earlier so in 2020 there were 56 motor
 
02:15:47.990 --> 02:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle crashes resulting in
 
02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.549 align:start position:0%
vehicle crashes resulting in
756

02:15:49.549 --> 02:15:49.559 align:start position:0%
756
 
02:15:54.669 --> 02:15:54.679 align:start position:0%
injuries um there were 104 fatalities 26
 
02:15:58.629 --> 02:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
of those involved uh motorcycles and
 
02:16:01.990 --> 02:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
82.6% of them the motorcycle operator
 
02:16:03.270 --> 02:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
was at
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
fault um in 2021 there were 118
 
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
fatalities in New Hampshire 26 of those
 
02:16:13.109 --> 02:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
22% um involved motorcycles
 
02:16:16.750 --> 02:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
87.5% the motorcycle operator was at
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
fault um in 2023 there were 127
 
02:16:24.830 --> 02:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
fatalities in New Hampshire 40 of them
 
02:16:28.549 --> 02:16:28.559 align:start position:0%
31.5% involved
 
02:16:31.629 --> 02:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
motorcycles this bill references um
 
02:16:33.429 --> 02:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
developing educational guidelines which
 
02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
you've heard testimony too um I think
 
02:16:38.509 --> 02:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
that that's going to be challenging when
 
02:16:41.870 --> 02:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
you talk about lane splitting and
 
02:16:45.709 --> 02:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
filtering and it's not just the
 
02:16:47.990 --> 02:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists that need to be educated
 
02:16:51.190 --> 02:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
it is the entire public um there are
 
02:16:52.509 --> 02:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
only five states which you heard
 
02:16:55.110 --> 02:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
testimony too all of those states are
 
02:16:58.070 --> 02:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
out in the midwest um Hawaii
 
02:17:03.070 --> 02:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
Arizona um Montana Utah Colorado there's
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
no States up in the northeast or on the
 
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
East Coast that allow filtering and
 
02:17:10.669 --> 02:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
there will be a misunderstanding as to
 
02:17:13.709 --> 02:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
what filtering is opposed to um what
 
02:17:13.719 --> 02:17:16.030 align:start position:0%
what filtering is opposed to um what
splitting

02:17:16.030 --> 02:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
splitting
 
02:17:18.030 --> 02:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
is uh this would also be very
 
02:17:21.190 --> 02:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
challenging to enforce um if you talking
 
02:17:24.589 --> 02:17:24.599 align:start position:0%
about 95 in holiday weekend and traffic
 
02:17:28.750 --> 02:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
is um traveling at 5 miles an hour you'd
 
02:17:31.709 --> 02:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
see motorcycles splitting Lanes um
 
02:17:34.990 --> 02:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
filtering if you will if they're going
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
30 40 miles an hour there's no way to
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
enforce that um and the the majority of
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
public the hundreds of thousands of V
 
02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
visitors that we have every year aren't
 
02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
going to be expecting a vehicle to be
 
02:17:50.190 --> 02:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
passing uh on the right or left as they
 
02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
filter their way through traffic through
 
02:17:54.990 --> 02:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
the state um when they go to do Lane
 
02:17:58.629 --> 02:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
changes it's going to result in crashes
 
02:18:01.709 --> 02:18:01.719 align:start position:0%
um the pros don't outweigh the cons as
 
02:18:04.429 --> 02:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
it relates to safety um with filtering
 
02:18:06.589 --> 02:18:06.599 align:start position:0%
even if you look at downtown conquered
 
02:18:07.509 --> 02:18:07.519 align:start position:0%
people are going to be looking for
 
02:18:09.349 --> 02:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
parking spaces um they're going to have
 
02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
their turn signal on they're not going
 
02:18:12.349 --> 02:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
to be expecting a vehicle to be coming
 
02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
up on their right or their left um as
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
they go to turn into a a parking space
 
02:18:17.669 --> 02:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
it's going to result in additional
 
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
crashes additional injuries potential
 
02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:23.190 align:start position:0%
crashes additional injuries potential
fatalities

02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
um the traffic just isn't an issue um in
 
02:18:28.629 --> 02:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as it is in other states
 
02:18:28.639 --> 02:18:30.790 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as it is in other states
like

02:18:30.790 --> 02:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:18:33.870 --> 02:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
California in general I think the the
 
02:18:35.589 --> 02:18:35.599 align:start position:0%
motorcycle operators in the state are
 
02:18:37.870 --> 02:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
less experienced than in southern and
 
02:18:39.629 --> 02:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
western states where the climate is
 
02:18:42.790 --> 02:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
better um you just don't get the the
 
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
same amount of hours um in general that
 
02:18:51.230 --> 02:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:52.830 --> 02:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
um there will certainly be confusion as
 
02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
it relates to filtering in in lane
 
02:18:58.469 --> 02:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
splitting um even motorcyclists have a
 
02:19:00.589 --> 02:19:00.599 align:start position:0%
difficult time defining that let alone
 
02:19:03.309 --> 02:19:03.319 align:start position:0%
the the general
 
02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
public uh and it will certainly increase
 
02:19:08.990 --> 02:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
road rage um we see it now this will
 
02:19:15.270 --> 02:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:17.790 --> 02:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
um you know we we heard testimony as to
 
02:19:19.950 --> 02:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
who goes first when you come up to a a
 
02:19:21.790 --> 02:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
traffic light
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
um you could get into vehicles that are
 
02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
trying to race um I I just don't see any
 
02:19:31.070 --> 02:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
any benefit as it relates to safety with
 
02:19:33.309 --> 02:19:33.319 align:start position:0%
this with this
 
02:19:37.150 --> 02:19:37.160 align:start position:0%
law that's all I have right thanks uh
 
02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to throw one at you uh because
 
02:19:41.549 --> 02:19:41.559 align:start position:0%
you did mention a good point about that
 
02:19:42.910 --> 02:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have that type of traffic in
 
02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'll disagree with you on
 
02:19:47.309 --> 02:19:47.319 align:start position:0%
two days of the week Friday and Sunday
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
and it's usually on our interstates and
 
02:19:51.670 --> 02:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
they are locked up for
 
02:19:55.230 --> 02:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
hours what would your feeling be if
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
there was a law that said it was okay
 
02:19:59.870 --> 02:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
for motorcycles at a low speed could use
 
02:20:03.070 --> 02:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
the breakdown Lane in those
 
02:20:07.950 --> 02:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
situations I wouldn't be in favor of it
 
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
um what what is the what is the benefit
 
02:20:14.750 --> 02:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and it's if it's to alleviate traffic
 
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
we just don't have hundreds of thousands
 
02:20:20.389 --> 02:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
of motorcycles that are traveling it's
 
02:20:24.510 --> 02:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
it's its vehicles um yes it can be hot
 
02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
on certain days but we don't have the
 
02:20:28.349 --> 02:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
same climate and the same weather that
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
that you see in States like Arizona we
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
don't have the same roads and again the
 
02:20:35.469 --> 02:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
the motoring public is not expecting
 
02:20:37.630 --> 02:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
vehicles to be traveling in Breakdown
 
02:20:40.270 --> 02:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
Lanes they're not expecting um
 
02:20:43.070 --> 02:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
motorcycles to be traveling um down
 
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
middle Lanes so they're they're not
 
02:20:47.429 --> 02:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
expecting it and I don't know how you
 
02:20:49.870 --> 02:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
how you educate that unless it becomes a
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
more common practice across this country
 
02:20:55.070 --> 02:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
not just in certain parts of this
 
02:20:57.349 --> 02:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
country and it's not a common practice
 
02:20:59.550 --> 02:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
up here and if we are the first state
 
02:21:01.790 --> 02:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
that implements that in the Northeast uh
 
02:21:03.150 --> 02:21:03.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to be the ones that that
 
02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
have all the The Growing Pains so to
 
02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
speak I'm breaking my own rule but you
 
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
asked me what the benefit would be and I
 
02:21:12.349 --> 02:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
would say that the benefit probably is
 
02:21:14.349 --> 02:21:14.359 align:start position:0%
that seeing us on most motorcycles are
 
02:21:17.150 --> 02:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
air cooled uh preventing damage to my
 
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
motorcycle would be a benefit anybody
 
02:21:21.630 --> 02:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
else from the committee
 
02:21:23.389 --> 02:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
well represent
 
02:21:26.190 --> 02:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
gas thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:21:28.910 --> 02:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
Trooper how often do you have instances
 
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
where a police car is turned into
 
02:21:33.790 --> 02:21:33.800 align:start position:0%
sideswiped or otherwise damaged um when
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
it is passing by traffic um because I
 
02:21:39.630 --> 02:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
know one of your points was that traffic
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't expect it you've got lights and
 
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
siren and they still surprise me do you
 
02:21:45.870 --> 02:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
have a lot of side collisions from uh
 
02:21:47.389 --> 02:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
civilians just turning into the police
 
02:21:48.870 --> 02:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
car when you go buy
 
02:21:51.270 --> 02:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
them I I don't have the
 
02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
the statistics on that um it does happen
 
02:21:57.270 --> 02:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
um but to your point if it's happening
 
02:21:59.950 --> 02:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
when we have Audible lights and Sirens
 
02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
um I can only imagine what's going to
 
02:22:05.070 --> 02:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
happen when when motorcycles don't
 
02:22:07.990 --> 02:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
they're hard to see already um we used
 
02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:08.710 align:start position:0%
they're hard to see already um we used
to

02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:22:12.550 --> 02:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
allow our motorcycle unit to pass um
 
02:22:15.550 --> 02:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
with lights and siren During certain
 
02:22:17.870 --> 02:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
escorts of vehicles and things like that
 
02:22:19.469 --> 02:22:19.479 align:start position:0%
um but we did away with that due to
 
02:22:22.630 --> 02:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
safety concerns and that is with
 
02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
um with Visual and audible warnings to
 
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
the to the motoring public just because
 
02:22:29.230 --> 02:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
they're not expecting it they're not
 
02:22:32.990 --> 02:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:36.070 --> 02:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
it representative Crawford thank you Mr
 
02:22:37.230 --> 02:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
question how do you see this working at
 
02:22:41.910 --> 02:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
the tolls because you know on July 4th
 
02:22:44.590 --> 02:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
or all our big holidays even though we
 
02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
have the 60 M hour straight through in
 
02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
hookit I'm thinking hookit that's where
 
02:22:51.150 --> 02:22:51.160 align:start position:0%
I travel the most um you still get a
 
02:22:53.389 --> 02:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
backup and and if you're gonna pay a
 
02:22:55.309 --> 02:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
toll you definitely get a backup do you
 
02:22:57.710 --> 02:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
see a problem with uh motorcyclists
 
02:22:59.630 --> 02:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of that with this new
 
02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
law of passing cars through trying to
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
get through the 60 M hour lane or even
 
02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
passing through trying to get ahead in
 
02:23:11.150 --> 02:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
the pay you know the paying
 
02:23:13.590 --> 02:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
Booth thank you for the question it
 
02:23:16.710 --> 02:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
certainly could um again I I think that
 
02:23:20.950 --> 02:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
the vast majority even though um
 
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
perception sometimes is is reality I
 
02:23:25.630 --> 02:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
think the vast majority of motorcycle um
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
operators are good labing citizens that
 
02:23:30.030 --> 02:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
want to do the right thing want to enjoy
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
this great state
 
02:23:35.469 --> 02:23:35.479 align:start position:0%
um but when you're talking about the
 
02:23:37.910 --> 02:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
other hundreds of thousands of motorists
 
02:23:40.590 --> 02:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
who aren't familiar with the law it it's
 
02:23:43.750 --> 02:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
going to result in road rage situations
 
02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
with them trying to cut in I just sat in
 
02:23:48.110 --> 02:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
traffic for the last three hours and now
 
02:23:49.469 --> 02:23:49.479 align:start position:0%
I have a motorcycle that's going to come
 
02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
in at the tolls potentially um
 
02:23:56.790 --> 02:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
it it has disaster written all over it
 
02:24:00.389 --> 02:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
um to be quite blunt um I just don't see
 
02:24:02.309 --> 02:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
anything positive coming out of this
 
02:24:04.630 --> 02:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
other than you know on real hot days the
 
02:24:08.269 --> 02:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
the overheating um in in general I just
 
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
don't think that this is what this state
 
02:24:11.150 --> 02:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
needs at this
 
02:24:13.429 --> 02:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
time any other questions from the
 
02:24:15.429 --> 02:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
02:24:18.670 --> 02:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh last pink card I have
 
02:24:21.190 --> 02:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
last person to sign up
 
02:24:23.710 --> 02:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
uh I'm giving a cleanup to Dan Goodman
 
02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
from the Triple
 
02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
A uh opposed to the
 
02:24:31.790 --> 02:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
Bill thank me
 
02:24:34.150 --> 02:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
later and I'm just I'm just kidding by
 
02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:39.910 align:start position:0%
later and I'm just I'm just kidding by
the

02:24:39.910 --> 02:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:42.590 --> 02:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
way apologies uh chairman members of the
 
02:24:44.389 --> 02:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for giving me a few
 
02:24:46.030 --> 02:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
minutes uh for the record my name is Dan
 
02:24:47.469 --> 02:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
Goodman I'm the public affairs and
 
02:24:49.030 --> 02:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
traffic safety manager for tripa
 
02:24:51.389 --> 02:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
Northern New England uh we represent
 
02:24:53.630 --> 02:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
about a little over a million uh members
 
02:24:56.389 --> 02:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
in Maine New Hampshire and Vermont we um
 
02:24:57.790 --> 02:24:57.800 align:start position:0%
over the years advocate for public
 
02:24:59.630 --> 02:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
policies to make our road safer here in
 
02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire distracted driving impair
 
02:25:05.070 --> 02:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
driving speeding and now uh Lane
 
02:25:07.469 --> 02:25:07.479 align:start position:0%
filtering um I'm hear in opposition to
 
02:25:10.429 --> 02:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
this it seems um as a very inherently
 
02:25:13.469 --> 02:25:13.479 align:start position:0%
dangerous activity especially with the
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
increasing number of fatalities not just
 
02:25:17.550 --> 02:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle fatalities but motor
 
02:25:19.150 --> 02:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
motorcycle F fatalities that we're
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
seeing nationally and here in in New
 
02:25:24.349 --> 02:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire over the last um 20 years
 
02:25:27.150 --> 02:25:27.160 align:start position:0%
we've seen uh motorcycle motorcycle
 
02:25:30.510 --> 02:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
fatalities about 30 times higher than uh
 
02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
automobile fatalities and over the last
 
02:25:34.510 --> 02:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
five years here in New Hampshire
 
02:25:37.269 --> 02:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
motorcycle fatalities have risen 20%
 
02:25:38.429 --> 02:25:38.439 align:start position:0%
that's alarming when I was looking at
 
02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
the data just six seven eight years ago
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
we were seeing motorcycle fatalities in
 
02:25:45.469 --> 02:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
the teens and most recently in 2023
 
02:25:48.670 --> 02:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
there was 40 motorcycle fatalities so
 
02:25:50.790 --> 02:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
passing a law to
 
02:25:53.510 --> 02:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
um allow in in our opinion inherently
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
dangerous activity um is not wise D
 
02:26:00.070 --> 02:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
drivers may not be aware um of a
 
02:26:02.190 --> 02:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
motorcycle passing them in the in the
 
02:26:04.590 --> 02:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
Middle Lane and in fact in some of our
 
02:26:05.910 --> 02:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
recent research where we looked at the
 
02:26:07.870 --> 02:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
blind spot monitoring which is in most
 
02:26:10.230 --> 02:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
new vehicles um they they they never
 
02:26:13.269 --> 02:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
detected motorcycles or very rarely and
 
02:26:15.030 --> 02:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
um we should say you
 
02:26:17.510 --> 02:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
know we you know we advise motorists not
 
02:26:19.150 --> 02:26:19.160 align:start position:0%
to rely on that but we found in that
 
02:26:20.750 --> 02:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
research that motorist
 
02:26:22.590 --> 02:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
over rely on their technology
 
02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
specifically their blind spot monitoring
 
02:26:27.790 --> 02:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
so they will be turning just in turning
 
02:26:29.429 --> 02:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
without uh sometimes looking at their
 
02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
blind spot and lastly um the conditions
 
02:26:34.790 --> 02:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
of uh New Hampshire roads are a concern
 
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the latest National report 33% of our
 
02:26:39.630 --> 02:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
roads are in poor in Med mediocre
 
02:26:42.309 --> 02:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
condition and that's a concern uh for
 
02:26:44.070 --> 02:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
not just motorcycles but automo
 
02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
automobiles as well um so that is all so
 
02:26:48.550 --> 02:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
much good stuff has been said so I'll
 
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
I'll just wrap it up quickly thankk you
 
02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
than you for the time I'd be happy to
 
02:26:52.590 --> 02:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
02:26:54.590 --> 02:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir any questions

03:57:43.630 --> 03:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
possible we will get started by opening
 
03:57:47.149 --> 03:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
up the executive session on House Bill
 
03:57:49.910 --> 03:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
105 FN creating a new conservation
 
03:57:51.790 --> 03:57:51.800 align:start position:0%
license plate and directing the
 
03:57:54.349 --> 03:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
additional fee to the sign of bacteria
 
03:57:57.830 --> 03:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
mitigation loan and Grant fund uh chair
 
03:58:01.110 --> 03:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Coker for a
 
03:58:03.309 --> 03:58:03.319 align:start position:0%

yes sir sir so anything we can do to uh
 
03:58:20.309 --> 03:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
help mitigate cob bacteria I'm a fan of
 
03:58:22.269 --> 03:58:22.279 align:start position:0%
especially being from a district up in
 
03:58:25.349 --> 03:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
Meredith at uh on lake wiip pasak so I
 
03:58:28.950 --> 03:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
think this is a great way to help um
 
03:58:31.670 --> 03:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
pull up the uh funds available to uh
 
03:58:33.950 --> 03:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
fight it mitigate it and it kind of
 
03:58:37.070 --> 03:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
prevents some of these um Waterfront
 
03:58:38.990 --> 03:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
towns from having their taxes get jacked
 
03:58:41.030 --> 03:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
up for the mitigation efforts which can
 
03:58:44.309 --> 03:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
be a huge increase and it's voluntary so
 
03:58:45.750 --> 03:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's uh I think it's a win-win for
 
03:58:47.469 --> 03:58:47.479 align:start position:0%
everybody and I think it's also going to
 
03:58:50.349 --> 03:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
be a really good marketing vessel too I
 
03:58:52.070 --> 03:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
mean the that's going to be a cool
 
03:58:53.590 --> 03:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
license plate and people are going to
 
03:58:56.030 --> 03:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
see it around all around New England so
 
03:58:56.950 --> 03:58:56.960 align:start position:0%

committee representative SES yeah I I'm

in favor of the a to pass motion I I
 
03:59:08.550 --> 03:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
think that it's um I'm I will just
 
03:59:11.469 --> 03:59:11.479 align:start position:0%
express some skepticism about the costs
 
03:59:15.389 --> 03:59:15.399 align:start position:0%
involved that that the organization will
 
03:59:17.229 --> 03:59:17.239 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't see it as a revenue
 
03:59:19.510 --> 03:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
producing device but I do think it has
 
03:59:21.910 --> 03:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
very important public uh relations
 
03:59:25.389 --> 03:59:25.399 align:start position:0%
benefits very important benefits for uh
 
03:59:27.830 --> 03:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
bringing this issue to the Forefront and
 
03:59:30.550 --> 03:59:30.560 align:start position:0%

was that without uh is there a second
 
04:00:44.670 --> 04:00:44.680 align:start position:0%

04:03:52.750 --> 04:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
vote for a motion for OTP on 133 motions
 
04:03:55.229 --> 04:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
ought to pass is there a
 
04:03:58.469 --> 04:03:58.479 align:start position:0%
second seconded by representative hlin
 
04:04:00.149 --> 04:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
care to speak to your motion sir yes
 
04:04:03.149 --> 04:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
thank you um this bill is is going to
 
04:04:07.389 --> 04:04:07.399 align:start position:0%
help in terms of making sure that uh
 
04:04:09.229 --> 04:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
license requirements are being met in
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
terms of being registered to vote uh we
 
04:04:14.229 --> 04:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
had uh
 
04:04:17.309 --> 04:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
testimony from secretary um David
 
04:04:19.510 --> 04:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
scanlin who supports the bill and
 
04:04:22.510 --> 04:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
supports the language of the bill and
 
04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
based on all that I think it's a worthy
 
04:04:27.550 --> 04:04:27.560 align:start position:0%
bill that we should pass so that's why I
 
04:04:27.560 --> 04:04:28.910 align:start position:0%
bill that we should pass so that's why I
vote

04:04:28.910 --> 04:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:04:34.030 --> 04:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:37.030 --> 04:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
committee I saw representative
 
04:04:40.710 --> 04:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
sees thank you um so I would have to be
 
04:04:43.309 --> 04:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to the ought to pass motion um
 
04:04:47.590 --> 04:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh it my opposition is fundamentally
 
04:04:51.389 --> 04:04:51.399 align:start position:0%
related to uh several factors but the
 
04:04:53.229 --> 04:04:53.239 align:start position:0%
first one I want to talk about is that
 
04:04:56.550 --> 04:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
there's the cost so there is no money
 
04:05:00.389 --> 04:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
according to the fiscal note
 
04:05:03.149 --> 04:05:03.159 align:start position:0%
um it says quote unquote this bill does
 
04:05:04.910 --> 04:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
not provide funding nor does it
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
authorize new positions but within the
 
04:05:11.950 --> 04:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
within the um estimated State impact
 
04:05:14.830 --> 04:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
there's a $40,000 technology upgrade
 
04:05:16.670 --> 04:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
cost there's a
 
04:05:20.429 --> 04:05:20.439 align:start position:0%
$677,000 for DMV position for fiscal
 
04:05:20.439 --> 04:05:21.229 align:start position:0%
$677,000 for DMV position for fiscal
year

04:05:21.229 --> 04:05:21.239 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:05:26.910 --> 04:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
2026 70,000 for 2027 and 72,000 for
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2028 none of this none of
 
04:05:32.630 --> 04:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
those none of the funds have been
 
04:05:35.830 --> 04:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
appropriated for that so the question
 
04:05:39.189 --> 04:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
has to be just like your home budget all
 
04:05:41.790 --> 04:05:41.800 align:start position:0%
right you've now going to incur a bunch
 
04:05:44.469 --> 04:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
of new expenses
 
04:05:46.630 --> 04:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
what are we going to take away in order
 
04:05:49.670 --> 04:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
to be able to pay for these things if
 
04:05:51.389 --> 04:05:51.399 align:start position:0%
this is the work that's required so
 
04:05:54.269 --> 04:05:54.279 align:start position:0%
that's my first and
 
04:05:57.750 --> 04:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
biggest uh concern about this bill
 
04:06:02.269 --> 04:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
secondly um while the the DMV to their
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
credit did provide us with a with uh
 
04:06:07.429 --> 04:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
lots of information about the costs we
 
04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
did not hear that there were any costs
 
04:06:12.990 --> 04:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
particularly associated with the uh
 
04:06:16.189 --> 04:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
secretary State's office and I'll take
 
04:06:18.990 --> 04:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
that at face value but I I never knew a
 
04:06:21.710 --> 04:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
government agency that could do much
 
04:06:24.309 --> 04:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
without having some cost and I sort of
 
04:06:25.710 --> 04:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
wish that they had provided that
 
04:06:27.349 --> 04:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
information to us so we're sort of
 
04:06:27.359 --> 04:06:28.910 align:start position:0%
information to us so we're sort of
buying

04:06:28.910 --> 04:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
buying
 
04:06:33.229 --> 04:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
into no cost associated with this um so
 
04:06:37.630 --> 04:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
for those two reasons primarily um I'm
 
04:06:40.349 --> 04:06:40.359 align:start position:0%
I'm very concerned that this is given
 
04:06:43.670 --> 04:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal restraints that we face in
 
04:06:46.910 --> 04:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
the coming bium that this is not the
 
04:06:50.469 --> 04:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
time for us to be spending money on a
 
04:06:51.590 --> 04:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
system that
 
04:06:54.349 --> 04:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
isn't that that is going to cost this
 
04:06:57.670 --> 04:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:59.870 --> 04:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
money anybody else from the committee
 
04:07:01.590 --> 04:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative Miller thank you Mr
 
04:07:03.790 --> 04:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
chairman uh in addition to some of the
 
04:07:06.349 --> 04:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
points representative Sykes raised uh
 
04:07:08.189 --> 04:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
and the cost side of things uh Printing
 
04:07:09.469 --> 04:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
and postage is also going to become part
 
04:07:10.710 --> 04:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
of that which does not seem to be
 
04:07:13.149 --> 04:07:13.159 align:start position:0%
accounted for um but more broadly than
 
04:07:15.229 --> 04:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
that uh to the point of this is
 
04:07:18.469 --> 04:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
necessary to ensure uh voting be
 
04:07:20.950 --> 04:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate as a moderator also in my
 
04:07:24.830 --> 04:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
town um I strongly disagree with that we
 
04:07:26.469 --> 04:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
accept out ofate IDs it is something
 
04:07:28.710 --> 04:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
that has happened for years it's fine
 
04:07:30.830 --> 04:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
the people change there's no enforcement
 
04:07:32.670 --> 04:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
on this there's no indication of what
 
04:07:34.750 --> 04:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
these these letters do this seems to be
 
04:07:37.710 --> 04:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
a bill uh that is much more postering
 
04:07:40.670 --> 04:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
than actual value to our state and our
 
04:07:42.550 --> 04:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
constituents and I strongly urge folks
 
04:07:45.109 --> 04:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
to vote against it
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the
 
04:07:50.710 --> 04:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
committee really I'm surprised uh I will
 
04:07:52.910 --> 04:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
chime in on this one just briefly uh
 
04:07:55.269 --> 04:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
first of all this is a exact Bill well
 
04:07:57.189 --> 04:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
not exact it is a very similar Bill to
 
04:08:00.309 --> 04:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
the one we saw last year and I will
 
04:08:02.109 --> 04:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
commend the prime sponsor for actually
 
04:08:04.590 --> 04:08:04.600 align:start position:0%
doing the due diligence reaching out to
 
04:08:06.189 --> 04:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
and working with to a great extent the
 
04:08:08.309 --> 04:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
department of M of vehicles and the
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State both who see now the
 
04:08:13.990 --> 04:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
Merit in this um you may not necessarily
 
04:08:15.870 --> 04:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
see it yourself there may not be a
 
04:08:19.349 --> 04:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
complete uh silver but or golden egg I
 
04:08:21.070 --> 04:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
guess if you will on what they can do
 
04:08:22.910 --> 04:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
when when people are in violation of
 
04:08:25.389 --> 04:08:25.399 align:start position:0%
this now that's the wrong wrong metaphor
 
04:08:26.670 --> 04:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
but you know what I'm
 
04:08:29.590 --> 04:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
saying um in other words I see what
 
04:08:31.670 --> 04:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
they're trying to hear information
 
04:08:32.750 --> 04:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes is all you need to be
 
04:08:35.070 --> 04:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
successful in terms of the the the
 
04:08:37.149 --> 04:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
funding which I don't disagree with
 
04:08:41.990 --> 04:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative sites um yeah 40 67 70 72
 
04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
etc etc um I'm making a decision based
 
04:08:48.149 --> 04:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
on the policy of this and that's why
 
04:08:50.590 --> 04:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
this is an early bill and I I will
 
04:08:51.990 --> 04:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
assume that it's going to a committee
 
04:08:53.710 --> 04:08:53.720 align:start position:0%
that's going to actually look at the the
 
04:08:56.389 --> 04:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
spending uh specifically if this moves
 
04:09:01.109 --> 04:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:03.990 --> 04:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
it um I don't know you're gonna pick on
 
04:09:06.269 --> 04:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
me okay then you can have
 
04:09:08.950 --> 04:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
it you would let me anyways even if I
 
04:09:10.750 --> 04:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
was even if I was going to pick on you
 
04:09:13.670 --> 04:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I know that about you um
 
04:09:15.630 --> 04:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
actually bringing up the point of the
 
04:09:18.349 --> 04:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
policy I think is it I want I think it's
 
04:09:21.550 --> 04:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
important to reemphasize that when we do
 
04:09:23.269 --> 04:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
state law we should do things because
 
04:09:25.670 --> 04:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
we're fixing problems that have been
 
04:09:28.710 --> 04:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
identified and need to be fixed the the
 
04:09:31.510 --> 04:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
issue is what what we don't want to do
 
04:09:34.389 --> 04:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
is to do more harm than good when we fix
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
if we fix one thing and then we break
 
04:09:38.950 --> 04:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
something else elsewhere that's a real
 
04:09:41.070 --> 04:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
problem the problem with this
 
04:09:43.469 --> 04:09:43.479 align:start position:0%
legislation is that I see that it's
 
04:09:47.469 --> 04:09:47.479 align:start position:0%
potentially breaking another piece I'll
 
04:09:50.950 --> 04:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
speak specifically to the uh one of a
 
04:09:52.750 --> 04:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
persons who testified in the public
 
04:09:56.750 --> 04:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
hearing made note of the fact that many
 
04:09:59.109 --> 04:09:59.119 align:start position:0%
um older
 
04:10:01.550 --> 04:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
persons who've had I like to
 
04:10:03.990 --> 04:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
characterize my peers as we've all had
 
04:10:07.830 --> 04:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
many birthdays okay and at some point in
 
04:10:10.550 --> 04:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
our lives we we find that we end up that
 
04:10:13.389 --> 04:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
we go to an assisted living facil
 
04:10:16.670 --> 04:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
facility and you often have to go to a
 
04:10:19.590 --> 04:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
facility that is not exactly in your
 
04:10:22.109 --> 04:10:22.119 align:start position:0%
neighborhood it might be in another town
 
04:10:24.590 --> 04:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
it might be in another state It's Not
 
04:10:27.670 --> 04:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
Unusual for Vermont residents for
 
04:10:29.550 --> 04:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
instance to end up in the nursing home
 
04:10:31.469 --> 04:10:31.479 align:start position:0%
in north havil New Hampshire which is of
 
04:10:34.189 --> 04:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
course a lovely Community but uh it's
 
04:10:37.630 --> 04:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
north havil New Hampshire and um but
 
04:10:39.870 --> 04:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
they they end up there they don't have a
 
04:10:43.309 --> 04:10:43.319 align:start position:0%
driver's license that is in date anymore
 
04:10:44.990 --> 04:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
they have an out-of-date Vermont
 
04:10:47.510 --> 04:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
driver's license but they are fully
 
04:10:50.070 --> 04:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
capable of voting and when they show up
 
04:10:53.070 --> 04:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
to vote to prove who they are they use
 
04:10:56.030 --> 04:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
their out ofate Vermont
 
04:10:59.149 --> 04:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
license under this what is the DMV going
 
04:11:02.229 --> 04:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
to do they're going to send them a
 
04:11:05.790 --> 04:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
letter to say that they have to um get a
 
04:11:08.469 --> 04:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire driver's license it
 
04:11:10.109 --> 04:11:10.119 align:start position:0%
there's an added cost there for the
 
04:11:12.309 --> 04:11:12.319 align:start position:0%
state that is unnecessary and and makes
 
04:11:14.269 --> 04:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
it more a little more challenging for
 
04:11:17.830 --> 04:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
moderators and for um for the voters and
 
04:11:20.030 --> 04:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
for that reason I like I said we may be
 
04:11:21.550 --> 04:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
fixing one problem here but we're
 
04:11:23.830 --> 04:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
creating another one elsewhere and for
 
04:11:26.510 --> 04:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
that again I can't I can't support this
 
04:11:28.990 --> 04:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
bill represent
 
04:11:32.030 --> 04:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
G thank you Mr chair uh I am going to
 
04:11:33.910 --> 04:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
support the bill for several reasons and
 
04:11:35.670 --> 04:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to offer a resource that has
 
04:11:37.670 --> 04:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
also been offered uh to your concern
 
04:11:40.750 --> 04:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
representative sees so when um the
 
04:11:41.910 --> 04:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and the director of
 
04:11:43.389 --> 04:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles come in here and they say
 
04:11:44.750 --> 04:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
that something is a good idea that
 
04:11:47.429 --> 04:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
reinforces their job and it helps with a
 
04:11:49.030 --> 04:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
problem that they have envisioned I'm
 
04:11:50.590 --> 04:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
inclined to believe them and vote in
 
04:11:53.469 --> 04:11:53.479 align:start position:0%
that favor also this legislative body
 
04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
just a couple years ago supported the
 
04:11:57.630 --> 04:11:57.640 align:start position:0%
funding of the uh we serve you the
 
04:11:59.670 --> 04:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
Mobile DMV bread truck I don't know if
 
04:12:01.790 --> 04:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
any of you have ever seen that and the
 
04:12:05.389 --> 04:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
DMV has that ready to go like if you put
 
04:12:10.750 --> 04:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
in a request from um a senior home or or
 
04:12:12.349 --> 04:12:12.359 align:start position:0%
a village such as you know we have a
 
04:12:14.710 --> 04:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
retirement village in gtown if you put
 
04:12:16.630 --> 04:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
in a request request through the DMV
 
04:12:18.630 --> 04:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
they can bring the portable DMV office
 
04:12:20.030 --> 04:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
and they can do driver's license
 
04:12:22.429 --> 04:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
appointments out of that portable DMV so
 
04:12:24.269 --> 04:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
it is a resource that we have to be able
 
04:12:29.750 --> 04:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:32.750 --> 04:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
it not a problem anybody else from the
 
04:12:34.670 --> 04:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
committee I guess we could go back and
 
04:12:36.550 --> 04:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
forth on this forever I I don't see the
 
04:12:37.750 --> 04:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
issue I don't think this breaking
 
04:12:40.429 --> 04:12:40.439 align:start position:0%
anything else uh nobody's ever in my
 
04:12:42.309 --> 04:12:42.319 align:start position:0%
time here had a qualm about the fact
 
04:12:44.429 --> 04:12:44.439 align:start position:0%
that after 60 days it's current law
 
04:12:47.149 --> 04:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to uh get your license
 
04:12:49.469 --> 04:12:49.479 align:start position:0%
here uh for whatever reason if you don't
 
04:12:51.349 --> 04:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is just shuring up what we
 
04:12:53.790 --> 04:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
already have in law and by sending out
 
04:12:55.309 --> 04:12:55.319 align:start position:0%
notifications so those people that
 
04:12:57.469 --> 04:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
haven't complied with law yet that it's
 
04:12:59.790 --> 04:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
time to do so I've also believe in the
 
04:13:02.229 --> 04:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
hearing that I heard that this may be
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
part one of the bill this is a good
 
04:13:05.910 --> 04:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
thing to move forward and in terms of
 
04:13:07.950 --> 04:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
any any enforcement there could be a
 
04:13:10.630 --> 04:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
part two coming down the road so so for
 
04:13:12.590 --> 04:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
that I I'll be supporting it once again
 
04:13:16.269 --> 04:13:16.279 align:start position:0%
anybody from the committee seeing none
 
04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is ought to pass and
 
04:13:20.469 --> 04:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
I will ask the clerk to call the rule
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%

gallery we have had a couple of changes
 
04:15:21.109 --> 04:15:21.119 align:start position:0%

that we cannot get done today there'll
 
04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%

04:16:50.680 --> 04:16:52.189 align:start position:0%
 
briefly

04:16:52.189 --> 04:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
04:16:52.199 --> 04:16:54.030 align:start position:0%
briefly
itl

04:16:54.030 --> 04:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
itl
 
04:16:59.030 --> 04:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
yeah um there were a number of things in
 
04:17:01.790 --> 04:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
the uh in the bill is filed that needed
 
04:17:06.109 --> 04:17:06.119 align:start position:0%
work um I'll give you one example it was
 
04:17:08.830 --> 04:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
suggested that there would be I forget
 
04:17:10.630 --> 04:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
how many people but a certain number of
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
people from Massachusetts on on the uh
 
04:17:18.189 --> 04:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
on the new commission um no indication
 
04:17:20.309 --> 04:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
of how they're picking those
 
04:17:22.389 --> 04:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts people or who was going to
 
04:17:24.950 --> 04:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
pick those Massachusetts people um
 
04:17:27.070 --> 04:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
number of things like that a member
 
04:17:28.950 --> 04:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
representing the United States Army Corp
 
04:17:28.960 --> 04:17:29.750 align:start position:0%
representing the United States Army Corp
of

04:17:29.750 --> 04:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:17:33.189 --> 04:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
Engineers who's going to do that um
 
04:17:34.229 --> 04:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
representing Department of
 
04:17:37.510 --> 04:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation again so um I think there
 
04:17:39.870 --> 04:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
was an awful lot of work to do more so
 
04:17:42.389 --> 04:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
than what would have been accomplished
 
04:17:46.349 --> 04:17:46.359 align:start position:0%
um in in just a study session or an
 
04:17:48.710 --> 04:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
extra couple weeks we're we've heard
 
04:17:51.109 --> 04:17:51.119 align:start position:0%
that there may be an amendment coming
 
04:17:54.870 --> 04:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
but um no one to my knowledge spoke to
 
04:17:58.349 --> 04:17:58.359 align:start position:0%
leadership of the committee so um that
 
04:18:01.149 --> 04:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
such a an amendment was coming was
 
04:18:03.870 --> 04:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
forthcoming so with that reason for all
 
04:18:07.469 --> 04:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
those Reasons I'm going to suggest
 
04:18:13.229 --> 04:18:13.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:15.510 --> 04:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further discussion
 
04:18:16.950 --> 04:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the clerk to call the role when
 
04:18:19.269 --> 04:18:19.279 align:start position:0%

04:18:23.469 --> 04:18:23.479 align:start position:0%

04:21:01.670 --> 04:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
very briefly um we had had a lot of
 
04:21:03.830 --> 04:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
great representatives from different
 
04:21:06.590 --> 04:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
aspects of the uh handicap Community
 
04:21:08.269 --> 04:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
come in and different advocacy
 
04:21:11.469 --> 04:21:11.479 align:start position:0%
organizations and so forth and um just
 
04:21:13.790 --> 04:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
want to summarize that the language of
 
04:21:17.229 --> 04:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
this bill um eliminates the limit of the
 
04:21:20.550 --> 04:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
number of plates that a handicap
 
04:21:23.309 --> 04:21:23.319 align:start position:0%
individual can get this bill's language
 
04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
does not touch
 
04:21:29.349 --> 04:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
placards and when we clarify that for
 
04:21:29.359 --> 04:21:30.469 align:start position:0%
placards and when we clarify that for
all

04:21:30.469 --> 04:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:21:33.189 --> 04:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
concerned uh it is my impression that
 
04:21:36.030 --> 04:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
all organizations are enthusiastic about
 
04:21:40.189 --> 04:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
this bill and um you know we we vetted
 
04:21:42.149 --> 04:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
it but once again I just want to stress
 
04:21:44.229 --> 04:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
that this removes the any limit on the
 
04:21:47.149 --> 04:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
number of handicap plates a handicapped
 
04:21:50.710 --> 04:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
person with a walking disability can
 
04:21:53.429 --> 04:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
get anybody else from the committee
 
04:21:56.389 --> 04:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:56.399 --> 04:21:58.389 align:start position:0%
 
way

04:21:58.389 --> 04:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:22:00.429 --> 04:22:00.439 align:start position:0%
nobody represent of
 
04:22:03.149 --> 04:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
London I didn't move fast enough just
 
04:22:04.670 --> 04:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
kidding now thank you Mr just a quick
 
04:22:07.189 --> 04:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
question in the legisl it's for each
 
04:22:10.870 --> 04:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle owned so will the uh individuals
 
04:22:12.710 --> 04:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
with the handicap be bringing their
 
04:22:15.870 --> 04:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
registrations in to show that they have
 
04:22:18.030 --> 04:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
two three four vehicles that they need
 
04:22:18.040 --> 04:22:19.309 align:start position:0%
two three four vehicles that they need
placards

04:22:19.309 --> 04:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
placards
 
04:22:23.590 --> 04:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
for um thank you for the question uh
 
04:22:26.590 --> 04:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
honestly I'm not 100% sure of the um a
 
04:22:28.710 --> 04:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
toz of the mechanics of the the process
 
04:22:32.149 --> 04:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
of how to apply and then receive um
 
04:22:34.910 --> 04:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
these materials um I can tell you with
 
04:22:38.149 --> 04:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
the current situation that if you run
 
04:22:42.750 --> 04:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
into a situation where you have um
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
spouses who are both handicapped the end
 
04:22:48.950 --> 04:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
result would be one handicap plate even
 
04:22:51.710 --> 04:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
if they each stoned an a vehicle and
 
04:22:55.149 --> 04:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
three placards this bill is a first step
 
04:22:57.510 --> 04:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
in addressing one aspect of this which
 
04:23:00.349 --> 04:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
is the limit on plates where it should
 
04:23:03.389 --> 04:23:03.399 align:start position:0%
be where both spouses no matter how many
 
04:23:05.710 --> 04:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
cars they have each one of the cars that
 
04:23:08.109 --> 04:23:08.119 align:start position:0%
they register and drive should have a
 
04:23:08.119 --> 04:23:09.830 align:start position:0%
they register and drive should have a
handicap

04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
handicap
 
04:23:11.870 --> 04:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
plate but the answer your question
 
04:23:13.590 --> 04:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
represent and yeah these these are not
 
04:23:15.950 --> 04:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
cover plates so you're registering the
 
04:23:18.590 --> 04:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle with those plates so obviously
 
04:23:19.990 --> 04:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
you need proof of ownership of the
 
04:23:22.910 --> 04:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle you know so it's not like a
 
04:23:24.630 --> 04:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
vanity plate or I mean a cover plate
 
04:23:26.510 --> 04:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
that you could put on anything these are
 
04:23:28.790 --> 04:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
specific to the vehicle anybody else
 
04:23:31.830 --> 04:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
from the committee represent of SES yeah
 
04:23:34.109 --> 04:23:34.119 align:start position:0%
I just I just want to be clear actually
 
04:23:37.070 --> 04:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
if if a married couple have two cars
 
04:23:39.189 --> 04:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
they can both register those vehicles
 
04:23:41.830 --> 04:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
under current law and both get a
 
04:23:45.189 --> 04:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
handicap plate so there is no limitation
 
04:23:48.670 --> 04:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
as far as that goes um the bill itself
 
04:23:52.389 --> 04:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
does not address um placards per se and
 
04:23:56.149 --> 04:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
only talks about plates
 
04:24:00.630 --> 04:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm very in all cander I am very
 
04:24:05.790 --> 04:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
ambivalent about this bill um DMV is was
 
04:24:08.550 --> 04:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
not I I I'm not trying to put words in
 
04:24:12.429 --> 04:24:12.439 align:start position:0%
any member of the DMV uh mouth but they
 
04:24:13.950 --> 04:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
were I
 
04:24:17.469 --> 04:24:17.479 align:start position:0%
think they were equally ambivalent about
 
04:24:19.630 --> 04:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
uh not being
 
04:24:22.990 --> 04:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
particularly uh supportive of this bill
 
04:24:25.950 --> 04:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
so um I'm I'm inclined to vote against
 
04:24:28.189 --> 04:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
it because I think it has it raises a
 
04:24:30.910 --> 04:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
few questions I think the idea that we
 
04:24:34.429 --> 04:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
would make handicapped
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
accessibility uh
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
issues easier for people is a good one
 
04:24:43.109 --> 04:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure that this I'm no pun
 
04:24:45.229 --> 04:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
intended I'm not sure this bill is the
 
04:24:49.830 --> 04:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:53.309 --> 04:24:53.319 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
04:24:56.710 --> 04:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
G so uh I am I am favoring this bill if
 
04:24:56.720 --> 04:24:57.510 align:start position:0%
G so uh I am I am favoring this bill if
you

04:24:57.510 --> 04:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:24:59.870 --> 04:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
have um if you have a circumstance where
 
04:25:03.389 --> 04:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
somebody has more than one vehicle um
 
04:25:06.429 --> 04:25:06.439 align:start position:0%
their option is either a license plate
 
04:25:08.710 --> 04:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
or a placard and right now one of the
 
04:25:10.309 --> 04:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
chief complaints that we've heard about
 
04:25:12.389 --> 04:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the placard
 
04:25:14.349 --> 04:25:14.359 align:start position:0%
situation is that the placards are
 
04:25:18.830 --> 04:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
easily um gotten offline uh fraudulently
 
04:25:21.349 --> 04:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
and that they can be hard to track a
 
04:25:22.990 --> 04:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
license plate is a part of your
 
04:25:25.429 --> 04:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
vehicle's registration and it is bolted
 
04:25:27.550 --> 04:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
to the vehicle is much easier to track
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
it is much harder to defraud and so if
 
04:25:33.149 --> 04:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
you are a person who has you know
 
04:25:35.670 --> 04:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
multiple vehicles with one handicap
 
04:25:37.910 --> 04:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
person you know you have a truck to tow
 
04:25:39.790 --> 04:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
your trailer and a commuting car or some
 
04:25:42.670 --> 04:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
any combination you know a vehicle and a
 
04:25:45.349 --> 04:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
motorcycle then you could get license
 
04:25:47.670 --> 04:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
plates for either and it would not
 
04:25:49.750 --> 04:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
influence the defrauding of the
 
04:25:52.269 --> 04:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
placards um it' be easier to track
 
04:25:54.070 --> 04:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
easier to hold accountable and it is
 
04:25:57.630 --> 04:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:59.710 --> 04:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle thank you sir anybody else
 
04:26:02.830 --> 04:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
representative Miller uh thank you uh
 
04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
building on that thought of the fraud
 
04:26:07.910 --> 04:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
there I'm curious me this doesn't remove
 
04:26:09.550 --> 04:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
placards from circulation this doesn't
 
04:26:12.469 --> 04:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
change any of that how is this reducing
 
04:26:14.550 --> 04:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
fraud as opposed to arguably making it
 
04:26:17.349 --> 04:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
easier for if there is a family with
 
04:26:20.269 --> 04:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
multiple people or with multiple
 
04:26:22.349 --> 04:26:22.359 align:start position:0%
vehicles and one handicapped person
 
04:26:24.670 --> 04:26:24.680 align:start position:0%
arguably this makes it easier for that
 
04:26:27.070 --> 04:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
fraud to happen when someone drives the
 
04:26:28.750 --> 04:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
the an able-bodied person drives the car
 
04:26:30.149 --> 04:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
in pars hand space anyway because it's
 
04:26:33.910 --> 04:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
on the license plate no that was a
 
04:26:36.070 --> 04:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
questiones go ahead
 
04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
represent so um to your point on the
 
04:26:41.590 --> 04:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
placards uh I do think you know I don't
 
04:26:42.990 --> 04:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
have a crystal ball but I do think
 
04:26:44.590 --> 04:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
there's a reckoning coming where all of
 
04:26:45.950 --> 04:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
placards are going to be called into
 
04:26:48.030 --> 04:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
question because of how easy they are to
 
04:26:50.790 --> 04:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
defraud um to your question of uh
 
04:26:51.870 --> 04:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not somebody could
 
04:26:53.710 --> 04:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
fraudulently take a a vehicle with
 
04:26:55.229 --> 04:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
somebody else's license plate and abuse
 
04:26:58.309 --> 04:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
it I mean it is my sincere belief that
 
04:27:00.229 --> 04:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
people tend to be decent human beings
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
and that they don't like when I don't
 
04:27:03.269 --> 04:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
need my handicap placard I park
 
04:27:05.030 --> 04:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and I walk in if I'm
 
04:27:06.590 --> 04:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
having a bad Mobility day then I use a
 
04:27:08.950 --> 04:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
handicap parking space of ones available
 
04:27:10.710 --> 04:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
um I believe that most of the populace
 
04:27:12.750 --> 04:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
is like that and I also don't think that
 
04:27:15.429 --> 04:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
we can um I don't think we can legislate
 
04:27:17.309 --> 04:27:17.319 align:start position:0%
morality and stop fraud in all of its
 
04:27:19.070 --> 04:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
places but I do think that there's going
 
04:27:20.429 --> 04:27:20.439 align:start position:0%
to be a reckoning coming with those blue
 
04:27:24.429 --> 04:27:24.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:31.950 --> 04:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:35.389 --> 04:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
else we'll leave it at that motion on
 
04:27:37.790 --> 04:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
the floor is ought to pass uh I'll ask

on where am I House Bill 287 requiring
 
04:30:18.870 --> 04:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
police departments to provide fire
 
04:30:21.030 --> 04:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
departments with certain motor personnel
 
04:30:22.389 --> 04:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
and insurance
 
04:30:24.670 --> 04:30:24.680 align:start position:0%
information following a motor vehicle
 
04:30:26.710 --> 04:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
incident um chair recognizes
 
04:30:29.269 --> 04:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative Hill for a motion thank
 
04:30:32.550 --> 04:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh I would move itl on
 
04:30:34.429 --> 04:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:30:37.510 --> 04:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
287 motion is inexpedient to legislate
 
04:30:39.990 --> 04:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
is there a second second seconded by
 
04:30:41.510 --> 04:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative foot K to speak to your
 
04:30:43.109 --> 04:30:43.119 align:start position:0%
motion sir
 
04:30:46.750 --> 04:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
um sure um we were told after the
 
04:30:49.469 --> 04:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
hearing um nothing arrived during the
 
04:30:51.269 --> 04:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
hearing unfortunately but we were told
 
04:30:53.710 --> 04:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
after the hearing that uh there is a
 
04:30:56.710 --> 04:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
federal hipple law that uh does not
 
04:30:59.870 --> 04:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
include fire departments as uh approved
 
04:31:03.109 --> 04:31:03.119 align:start position:0%
on the list of whom the police may share
 
04:31:05.910 --> 04:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
victim information with
 
04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
um so it appears that police do have U
 
04:31:12.990 --> 04:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
some authority to share information but
 
04:31:16.510 --> 04:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
only under certain circumstances or
 
04:31:20.550 --> 04:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
situations um as as if when a potential
 
04:31:23.550 --> 04:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
danger to the victim's health or safety
 
04:31:25.670 --> 04:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
but only the necessary information
 
04:31:27.269 --> 04:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
should be shared to address the
 
04:31:30.269 --> 04:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
immediate emergency and still comply
 
04:31:34.590 --> 04:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
with privacy laws so it seems that there
 
04:31:36.790 --> 04:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
are some police departments that are
 
04:31:39.870 --> 04:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
able to circumvent these laws when
 
04:31:43.910 --> 04:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's when it's uh a a high cost item
 
04:31:46.429 --> 04:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
that fire department needs to re recover
 
04:31:51.149 --> 04:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
for but um in general just asking for
 
04:31:55.550 --> 04:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
their name and address um to to get
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
information for their insurance company
 
04:32:00.870 --> 04:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
for things like Speedy dry is um is a
 
04:32:04.109 --> 04:32:04.119 align:start position:0%
violation of Hippo laws so uh with that
 
04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
re uh as my basis I am uh suggesting we
 
04:32:14.030 --> 04:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:17.309 --> 04:32:17.319 align:start position:0%
thank you sir anybody else from the
 
04:32:19.670 --> 04:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
committee oh
 
04:32:21.950 --> 04:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative um I'm running a blank
 
04:32:23.950 --> 04:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
I've only said it 16 16 times today
 
04:32:26.389 --> 04:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
Miller it's Miller time
 
04:32:29.070 --> 04:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
um wow that landed way better than I
 
04:32:33.750 --> 04:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:37.469 --> 04:32:37.479 align:start position:0%
all um Can can you clarify where that
 
04:32:40.070 --> 04:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
hip information came from that does not
 
04:32:41.910 --> 04:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
align with what my understanding is of
 
04:32:43.389 --> 04:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
the law in particular how it applies to
 
04:32:45.790 --> 04:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and so the fact that it
 
04:32:48.070 --> 04:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
came in here late and not during the uh
 
04:32:52.710 --> 04:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:55.349 --> 04:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
no may
 
04:32:59.469 --> 04:32:59.479 align:start position:0%
follow I um are you scrambled here uh
 
04:33:02.149 --> 04:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
actually yeah how conf are you that the
 
04:33:05.269 --> 04:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
longer story um was uh after we had the
 
04:33:08.990 --> 04:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
hearing um several of us had to go to a
 
04:33:14.029 --> 04:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
uh a Chairman's uh function and uh and a
 
04:33:17.109 --> 04:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
lobbyist grabbed my arm and said I have
 
04:33:18.551 --> 04:33:18.561 align:start position:0%
some information about that bill you
 
04:33:22.070 --> 04:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
heard today and um and he was the one
 
04:33:24.990 --> 04:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
that um that said uh federal laws aren't
 
04:33:26.310 --> 04:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
going to allow you to get that
 
04:33:28.750 --> 04:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
information I've asked at the time I
 
04:33:30.830 --> 04:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
gave him my business card and said um
 
04:33:32.910 --> 04:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
send me that federal law I'd like to
 
04:33:36.070 --> 04:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
know more about it um so even right up
 
04:33:39.949 --> 04:33:39.959 align:start position:0%
until now um actually um it turns out
 
04:33:42.590 --> 04:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
Small World New Hampshire is that um
 
04:33:44.949 --> 04:33:44.959 align:start position:0%
representative foot is uh familiar with
 
04:33:47.709 --> 04:33:47.719 align:start position:0%
this person that uh that had this uh
 
04:33:50.269 --> 04:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
information for us I went looking and
 
04:33:50.279 --> 04:33:51.269 align:start position:0%
information for us I went looking and
and

04:33:51.269 --> 04:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:54.230 --> 04:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
scrambled they talk unfortunately a lot
 
04:33:56.189 --> 04:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
in on the internet and when I was
 
04:33:58.029 --> 04:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
looking for the information about the
 
04:34:00.510 --> 04:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
reverse um when fire departments are
 
04:34:02.349 --> 04:34:02.359 align:start position:0%
able to give information to police
 
04:34:04.189 --> 04:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
departments but there's not much
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
information of when police can give
 
04:34:09.949 --> 04:34:09.959 align:start position:0%
information to fire departments um but I
 
04:34:13.109 --> 04:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
did uh I did find that line and and you
 
04:34:15.990 --> 04:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
can tell that I read it um from this
 
04:34:18.510 --> 04:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
that was saying in certain circum
 
04:34:20.189 --> 04:34:20.199 align:start position:0%
certain situations such as when
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
potential danger to the victim's health
 
04:34:24.949 --> 04:34:24.959 align:start position:0%
or safety but only necessary information
 
04:34:29.150 --> 04:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
should be shared so um that's that's my
 
04:34:31.470 --> 04:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
reasoning I don't you know I'm not a
 
04:34:35.670 --> 04:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
hippo attorney and I'm not uh um as you
 
04:34:39.670 --> 04:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
can tell well versed on HIPPA laws so if
 
04:34:42.949 --> 04:34:42.959 align:start position:0%
I one more yeah very briefly um my
 
04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
understanding is that Hippa only applies
 
04:34:48.789 --> 04:34:48.799 align:start position:0%
to healthc care providers which the fire
 
04:34:49.789 --> 04:34:49.799 align:start position:0%
depart the excuse me the police
 
04:34:52.390 --> 04:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
department would not be a health
 
04:34:54.390 --> 04:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
provider in that sense that the Privacy
 
04:34:55.750 --> 04:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
situation for the health provider would
 
04:34:59.349 --> 04:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
not apply yeah I well I I am also not an
 
04:35:01.670 --> 04:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
expert but that's my understanding so if
 
04:35:03.109 --> 04:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
that's if that's the reason we're gonna
 
04:35:05.109 --> 04:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
itl this I think we might want to
 
04:35:06.310 --> 04:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
consider a different path that we could
 
04:35:08.269 --> 04:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
actually get an answer that we can
 
04:35:10.910 --> 04:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
confirm rather than guessing so what
 
04:35:14.070 --> 04:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
that is only go by the information in
 
04:35:18.510 --> 04:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
front of me um and it was um there's a
 
04:35:20.551 --> 04:35:20.561 align:start position:0%
whole host of people that can't share
 
04:35:22.830 --> 04:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
information like District Attorneys and
 
04:35:24.470 --> 04:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
police have discretion to share
 
04:35:26.910 --> 04:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
information they possess so it's not
 
04:35:31.830 --> 04:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
just limited to uh to Medical people um
 
04:35:34.830 --> 04:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
other than that um I don't disagree with
 
04:35:38.670 --> 04:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
the idea of um nailing it down but for
 
04:35:42.230 --> 04:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
my purposes at this point um uh
 
04:35:44.429 --> 04:35:44.439 align:start position:0%
calling it inexpedient to legislate I
 
04:35:47.109 --> 04:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
think it's it seems that I've hear I've
 
04:35:49.910 --> 04:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
heard it from two sources now so I'm
 
04:35:53.590 --> 04:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:55.670 --> 04:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
vote representative
 
04:35:58.510 --> 04:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
a thank you Mr chairman um it's my
 
04:35:59.830 --> 04:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
understanding that Hippa applies to
 
04:36:01.830 --> 04:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
privileged medical information if you're
 
04:36:04.189 --> 04:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
just exchanging motor vehicle insurance
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
policy numbers with so they can charge
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
back to the insurance company rather
 
04:36:09.310 --> 04:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
than having to charge directly to the
 
04:36:10.709 --> 04:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
victim so they have to go back to their
 
04:36:12.390 --> 04:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
insurance company for reimbursement
 
04:36:15.390 --> 04:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
later that doesn't apply to this um it's
 
04:36:17.390 --> 04:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
not MediCal it's not it doesn't fall
 
04:36:19.310 --> 04:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
under Hipp at all this would be under
 
04:36:22.670 --> 04:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
Fire and safety under state
 
04:36:27.470 --> 04:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
laws reading thank you oh yep
 
04:36:30.869 --> 04:36:30.879 align:start position:0%
um it's really hard not taking your mind
 
04:36:36.349 --> 04:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
out of the chair position you know um so
 
04:36:39.709 --> 04:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
uh as I'm reading here um and I'll Grant
 
04:36:44.429 --> 04:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
you this is late information but um it
 
04:36:47.429 --> 04:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
appears that it's more privacy than it
 
04:36:52.551 --> 04:36:52.561 align:start position:0%
is um medical limited to Medical so uh I
 
04:36:55.510 --> 04:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
believe what the what the the bill was
 
04:36:57.789 --> 04:36:57.799 align:start position:0%
calling for or looking for was
 
04:37:00.670 --> 04:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
information for for insurance companies
 
04:37:03.590 --> 04:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
for billing purposes for
 
04:37:06.390 --> 04:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
um he mentioned Speedy dryer somebody
 
04:37:10.670 --> 04:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
did um so I think that's where they're
 
04:37:13.949 --> 04:37:13.959 align:start position:0%
where the Police Department um as it
 
04:37:16.590 --> 04:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
happens in my community is relying on I
 
04:37:18.910 --> 04:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
think they're they're talking about U
 
04:37:22.150 --> 04:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
they're not releasing Privacy
 
04:37:25.109 --> 04:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
Information and they're deeming um
 
04:37:29.230 --> 04:37:29.240 align:start position:0%
contact information and um in that list
 
04:37:29.240 --> 04:37:31.109 align:start position:0%
contact information and um in that list
of

04:37:31.109 --> 04:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:37:34.189 --> 04:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
things representative s thank you Mr
 
04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
chairman so um couple of things at first
 
04:37:42.269 --> 04:37:42.279 align:start position:0%
blush one just to talk a little bit more
 
04:37:46.830 --> 04:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
about this Hippa thing um at first blush
 
04:37:48.510 --> 04:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
one would not think that the American
 
04:37:52.150 --> 04:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
Red Cross would be um privy to any
 
04:37:54.390 --> 04:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
health information about persons but
 
04:37:57.230 --> 04:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
they in fact can they are an exception
 
04:38:00.029 --> 04:38:00.039 align:start position:0%
to hipper they are allowed to obtain
 
04:38:02.429 --> 04:38:02.439 align:start position:0%
this information and and use it as
 
04:38:06.789 --> 04:38:06.799 align:start position:0%
necessary so I I think the the my
 
04:38:09.670 --> 04:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
concern is that there's if we're going
 
04:38:12.510 --> 04:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
to not pass a bill we should do so based
 
04:38:15.670 --> 04:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
on the fundamentals of the bill and I'm
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
not sure that this uh Hipp argument is
 
04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
there the other thing that I noticed was
 
04:38:23.349 --> 04:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
information obtained by the law
 
04:38:25.830 --> 04:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency that accident
 
04:38:28.789 --> 04:38:28.799 align:start position:0%
participants are required to exchange
 
04:38:33.510 --> 04:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the RSA 264 colon 25 to an
 
04:38:36.189 --> 04:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
owner operator or passenger of a vehicle
 
04:38:38.070 --> 04:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
involved with said accident this is the
 
04:38:39.990 --> 04:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
kind of information that people exchange
 
04:38:43.269 --> 04:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
all the time with just regular people
 
04:38:47.590 --> 04:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
not necessarily just the police and so
 
04:38:52.189 --> 04:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
um I I think privacy concerns are
 
04:38:55.590 --> 04:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
overstated in terms of uh fire
 
04:38:58.789 --> 04:38:58.799 align:start position:0%
departments wanting to be able to uh
 
04:39:01.590 --> 04:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
obtain the necessary information to bill
 
04:39:03.269 --> 04:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
for their services which they are
 
04:39:05.349 --> 04:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
allowed to do under
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
rsas um they're allowed to bill for
 
04:39:10.269 --> 04:39:10.279 align:start position:0%
health related issues with as far as the
 
04:39:12.590 --> 04:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
ambulance is concerned they're also if
 
04:39:15.269 --> 04:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
there's a Hazmat material uh incident
 
04:39:16.869 --> 04:39:16.879 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to build the owner of
 
04:39:19.629 --> 04:39:19.639 align:start position:0%
the property who caused the Hazmat
 
04:39:21.310 --> 04:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
incident in the first place they are
 
04:39:23.629 --> 04:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
allowed to bill for these types of
 
04:39:26.551 --> 04:39:26.561 align:start position:0%
things so what what
 
04:39:28.670 --> 04:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
they it is
 
04:39:31.709 --> 04:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that some police departments
 
04:39:34.670 --> 04:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
don't fail do do not always feel that
 
04:39:37.310 --> 04:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
they can or should provide this
 
04:39:39.948 --> 04:39:39.958 align:start position:0%
information I think this would provide
 
04:39:43.868 --> 04:39:43.878 align:start position:0%
Clarity so that um the information can
 
04:39:46.510 --> 04:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
be exchanged in in an appropriate
 
04:39:51.628 --> 04:39:51.638 align:start position:0%
fashion under this bill um I I I look at
 
04:39:54.430 --> 04:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
this and say no harm no foul I mean
 
04:39:57.670 --> 04:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
we're not it isn't causing any harm for
 
04:40:00.150 --> 04:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
the police departments to share
 
04:40:02.150 --> 04:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
information that they that people are
 
04:40:05.628 --> 04:40:05.638 align:start position:0%
required to exchange anyways and why
 
04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we help our
 
04:40:12.590 --> 04:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
citizens recover cost
 
04:40:15.910 --> 04:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
that their fire department takes on on
 
04:40:18.190 --> 04:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
their behalf so that they don't have to
 
04:40:21.150 --> 04:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
continue to pay for these things out of
 
04:40:25.590 --> 04:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
budget um and it this could be pennies
 
04:40:27.590 --> 04:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
it could be dollars it could be tens of
 
04:40:30.948 --> 04:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars and um I think we
 
04:40:34.150 --> 04:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to our citizens to
 
04:40:42.150 --> 04:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:44.150 --> 04:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the
 
04:40:51.430 --> 04:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:54.030 --> 04:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
um go have representative Johnson I'm in
 
04:40:55.830 --> 04:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
the I'm in the middle of reading
 
04:40:59.270 --> 04:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
26425 actually go ahead thank you Mr
 
04:41:00.470 --> 04:41:00.480 align:start position:0%

representative Hill after you had this
 
04:41:04.270 --> 04:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
conversation with the lobbyists did you
 
04:41:06.350 --> 04:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
have a subsequent conversation with the
 
04:41:08.590 --> 04:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
primary sponsor of the bill and if
 
04:41:12.990 --> 04:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
so what what can you tell us no
 
04:41:13.000 --> 04:41:15.310 align:start position:0%
so what what can you tell us no
thank

04:41:15.310 --> 04:41:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:17.750 --> 04:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
you anybody else representative
 
04:41:20.550 --> 04:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
Gorski thank you Mr
 
04:41:23.510 --> 04:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
chairman the the issue with this bill
 
04:41:28.628 --> 04:41:28.638 align:start position:0%
for me is we're trying to legislate
 
04:41:31.030 --> 04:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
conversation and to me I'm not a big fan
 
04:41:32.990 --> 04:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
of making a law to legislate
 
04:41:35.430 --> 04:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
conversation between two departments
 
04:41:36.910 --> 04:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
these departments should be able to kind
 
04:41:39.670 --> 04:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
of work this out I have a problem trying
 
04:41:42.788 --> 04:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
to legislatively build a law to say you
 
04:41:45.750 --> 04:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
two must talk so this is where I have a
 
04:41:47.190 --> 04:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill and that's why I
 
04:41:48.750 --> 04:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
can't support
 
04:41:50.948 --> 04:41:50.958 align:start position:0%
it you know representative Gorski
 
04:41:53.150 --> 04:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
dropped the mic because actually I as I
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
read through
 
04:41:57.190 --> 04:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
26425 representative Sykes is right too
 
04:41:58.510 --> 04:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
yeah this is normal information that's
 
04:42:00.110 --> 04:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
shared in an
 
04:42:02.670 --> 04:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
accident if they everybody was getting
 
04:42:05.070 --> 04:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
along we wouldn't be sitting here for
 
04:42:07.350 --> 04:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
the last half an hour and you're right
 
04:42:10.470 --> 04:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is just a a way to make people
 
04:42:12.350 --> 04:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
get along why they're not giving the
 
04:42:14.350 --> 04:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
information when it's requested of them
 
04:42:16.190 --> 04:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't know how we're
 
04:42:18.550 --> 04:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
going to fix it even with this passing
 
04:42:20.750 --> 04:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh anybody else from the committee
 
04:42:24.550 --> 04:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
representative G thank you Mr chair um I
 
04:42:26.310 --> 04:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
was just looking federally in this law
 
04:42:27.948 --> 04:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
becomes redundant because the code of
 
04:42:29.670 --> 04:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
administration enforcement already has a
 
04:42:32.070 --> 04:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
law on inter agency cooperation that was
 
04:42:34.750 --> 04:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh that was re get gets renewed by FEMA
 
04:42:36.750 --> 04:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
at a minimum every two years most recent
 
04:42:43.070 --> 04:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:43.080 --> 04:42:44.390 align:start position:0%
 
what's

04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
what's
 
04:42:47.190 --> 04:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
up I go ahead one more time with that
 
04:42:50.150 --> 04:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
there's a federal law in place already
 
04:42:52.430 --> 04:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
that tells agencies that they must have
 
04:42:54.390 --> 04:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
inter agency cooperation and
 
04:42:56.788 --> 04:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
communication and it is overseen by the
 
04:42:58.788 --> 04:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
Federal Emergency Management
 
04:43:01.070 --> 04:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
agency so that's more evidence in your
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
opinion that this is not needed at state
 
04:43:06.430 --> 04:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
level yes sir represent of sees thank
 
04:43:08.310 --> 04:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
you for that information so the the
 
04:43:11.830 --> 04:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
issue is that
 
04:43:14.670 --> 04:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
how if police departments are not
 
04:43:16.510 --> 04:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
sharing the
 
04:43:19.310 --> 04:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
information most small volunteer fire
 
04:43:22.190 --> 04:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
departments will a probably not be aware
 
04:43:25.070 --> 04:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
of this and B even if they were aware of
 
04:43:29.390 --> 04:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
it then what this is a very clear-cut
 
04:43:32.670 --> 04:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
example where we can intervene on the
 
04:43:35.070 --> 04:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
part of the small towns and fire
 
04:43:37.230 --> 04:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
departments in order to help their
 
04:43:41.628 --> 04:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
operations and I I just I that's for me
 
04:43:43.868 --> 04:43:43.878 align:start position:0%
that's the bottom
 
04:43:47.990 --> 04:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
line represent SES you even if this
 
04:43:50.750 --> 04:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
passes I agree with your question even
 
04:43:53.628 --> 04:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
if they do not provide the information
 
04:43:55.948 --> 04:43:55.958 align:start position:0%
then what because I believe it was even
 
04:43:57.948 --> 04:43:57.958 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor at the hearing that
 
04:43:59.788 --> 04:43:59.798 align:start position:0%
said maybe we should do more about some
 
04:44:01.430 --> 04:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
kind of penalty or punishment if they
 
04:44:03.590 --> 04:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't comply
 
04:44:05.910 --> 04:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
so I'll tell you I never would have
 
04:44:07.550 --> 04:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
thought in a million years when I walked
 
04:44:09.350 --> 04:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
in here this morning that this is the
 
04:44:11.788 --> 04:44:11.798 align:start position:0%
bill that we were going to be spending
 
04:44:13.110 --> 04:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
an hour
 
04:44:23.150 --> 04:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:26.910 --> 04:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
committee oh representative
 
04:44:30.070 --> 04:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
Hill well I wanted to suggest that
 
04:44:35.590 --> 04:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps um we recess this to next
 
04:44:37.948 --> 04:44:37.958 align:start position:0%
executive session and in the meantime we
 
04:44:41.948 --> 04:44:41.958 align:start position:0%
ask our very capable researcher to see
 
04:44:44.310 --> 04:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
if we would be overstepping Federal
 
04:44:48.350 --> 04:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
bounds to um do as representative syy
 
04:44:51.030 --> 04:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
suggests and make it easier for our
 
04:44:54.030 --> 04:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
local fire departments um which I don't
 
04:44:57.510 --> 04:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
think we're capable of doing um but it
 
04:44:59.510 --> 04:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
would be helpful if we
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
knew they either are federally allowed
 
04:45:06.628 --> 04:45:06.638 align:start position:0%
to be on this list or ferally not
 
04:45:11.110 --> 04:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
allowed on this list just a suggestion
 
04:45:14.990 --> 04:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.110 --> 04:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
that well it's true and seeing as how we
 
04:45:20.350 --> 04:45:20.360 align:start position:0%
have had a a spirited debate on this for
 
04:45:22.750 --> 04:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
a better part of an hour and we do have
 
04:45:26.350 --> 04:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
a couple of questions and it is also our
 
04:45:29.150 --> 04:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
first day of executive
 
04:45:31.628 --> 04:45:31.638 align:start position:0%
sessions I'm not opposed to doing that
 
04:45:35.628 --> 04:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
so I will recess this till the next day
 
04:45:38.670 --> 04:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
of executive session which will be and I
 
04:45:41.350 --> 04:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
will reschedule it too publicly but just
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
for everybody that's here I we will
 
04:45:45.670 --> 04:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
reschedule this for the is at the 3 is
 
04:45:50.708 --> 04:45:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:52.550 --> 04:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
believe I don't know looking at a
 
04:45:55.350 --> 04:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
calendar four fourth so I I will add
 
04:45:57.230 --> 04:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
this to the schedule for a next
 
04:45:59.910 --> 04:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
executive sessions on February 4th so
 
04:46:02.350 --> 04:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
with that as we recess
 
04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:39.840 --> 04:47:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:09.840 --> 04:47:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:22.788 --> 04:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:00.350 --> 04:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:04.190 --> 04:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
okay we get a little change in plans
 
04:49:07.548 --> 04:49:07.558 align:start position:0%
here um I'm going to open up we're move
 
04:49:09.430 --> 04:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
going to move ahead um we're going to
 
04:49:11.270 --> 04:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
open up the executive session on on
 
04:49:13.548 --> 04:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
House Bill 326
 
04:49:16.110 --> 04:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
FN prohibiting the operation of antique
 
04:49:19.470 --> 04:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
passenger vehicles model year 1968 rer
 
04:49:21.190 --> 04:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
on state or local highways for more than
 
04:49:22.910 --> 04:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
20 miles unless the vehicle is fitted or
 
04:49:25.190 --> 04:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
retrofitted with seat belt or safety
 
04:49:27.788 --> 04:49:27.798 align:start position:0%
belts sh recognizes representative guing
 
04:49:31.030 --> 04:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
for a motion I mooving expedient to
 
04:49:33.310 --> 04:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
legislate don't I'll jump at once who
 
04:49:34.990 --> 04:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
second in that representative foot okay
 
04:49:37.110 --> 04:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
so it's moved and second it inexpedient
 
04:49:38.868 --> 04:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
to legislate care to speak your motion
 
04:49:41.590 --> 04:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
sir yes sir thank you Mr chair
 
04:49:44.470 --> 04:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
so this bill creates a a plethora of
 
04:49:46.350 --> 04:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
issues uh one of the first ones is is
 
04:49:48.788 --> 04:49:48.798 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement issue by restricting a a
 
04:49:50.910 --> 04:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle to 20 miles on public roadways
 
04:49:53.590 --> 04:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
or as it's written um state and local
 
04:49:56.470 --> 04:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
highways you're creating a circumstance
 
04:49:58.190 --> 04:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
where uh where the police have to act
 
04:50:00.548 --> 04:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
with prejudice and Target antique
 
04:50:02.868 --> 04:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
vehicles and then going on a fishing
 
04:50:04.350 --> 04:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
expedition to ask them how far they've
 
04:50:06.510 --> 04:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
driven that day it doesn't say 20 mil
 
04:50:08.230 --> 04:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
per day it says 20 miles it doesn't say
 
04:50:10.470 --> 04:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
20 miles per sitting it says 20 miles so
 
04:50:13.430 --> 04:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
you could ride 18 miles get out and do
 
04:50:16.070 --> 04:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
something ride another 18 miles um so
 
04:50:18.030 --> 04:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
from an enforcement aspect this is
 
04:50:19.990 --> 04:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
nearly impossible also from an
 
04:50:21.990 --> 04:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement aspect neighboring laws that
 
04:50:24.230 --> 04:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
have uh or neighboring states that have
 
04:50:27.628 --> 04:50:27.638 align:start position:0%
laws that protect collectors do not have
 
04:50:29.190 --> 04:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
laws similar to this which means that if
 
04:50:30.708 --> 04:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
somebody from out of state came into the
 
04:50:32.548 --> 04:50:32.558 align:start position:0%
state 20 miles after they cross the
 
04:50:33.910 --> 04:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
border they are actually committing a
 
04:50:36.110 --> 04:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
crime against the state of New Hampshire
 
04:50:38.470 --> 04:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh further people that collect Vehicles
 
04:50:41.910 --> 04:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
like this will lose a lot of value um
 
04:50:43.670 --> 04:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
and by talking to many collectors and by
 
04:50:45.990 --> 04:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
doing nada research and Kelly BL value
 
04:50:49.948 --> 04:50:49.958 align:start position:0%
research uh it comes into between uh 30%
 
04:50:52.708 --> 04:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
and 50% in value loss the minute you put
 
04:50:55.708 --> 04:50:55.718 align:start position:0%
an uh an a modification on an antique
 
04:50:58.310 --> 04:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle that cannot be undone and in
 
04:51:00.070 --> 04:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
many of these cases in order to mount
 
04:51:01.990 --> 04:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
restraint systems in you would have to
 
04:51:03.590 --> 04:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
either replace the frame or weld
 
04:51:05.470 --> 04:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
additions onto the frame and that
 
04:51:07.030 --> 04:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
assumes that it's a metal frame vehicle
 
04:51:08.390 --> 04:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
and not a wooden frame vehicle which
 
04:51:11.070 --> 04:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
anything be bor born before about 19 28
 
04:51:14.670 --> 04:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
could possibly be so you're creating a
 
04:51:16.230 --> 04:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
detriment to the investor of the
 
04:51:20.270 --> 04:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
property you're creating a traffic uh a
 
04:51:23.628 --> 04:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
traffic non-compliance issue and
 
04:51:25.990 --> 04:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
enforceability um so for those reasons I
 
04:51:29.310 --> 04:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:31.310 --> 04:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you sir anybody else
 
04:51:33.030 --> 04:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:51:36.350 --> 04:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
committee um yep rips and a foot thank
 
04:51:38.750 --> 04:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and basically in short
 
04:51:40.868 --> 04:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
uh we are a state with no mandatory seat
 
04:51:43.390 --> 04:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
belt lost unless you're under a certain
 
04:51:48.110 --> 04:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
age um and I just think this bill is

04:51:58.788 --> 04:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
be the wrong way um yeah it's just it's
 
04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%

04:52:57.868 --> 04:52:57.878 align:start position:0%
our recommendation of inexpedient to
 
04:53:00.830 --> 04:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
legislate is adopted 160 I heard a
 
04:53:03.430 --> 04:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
motion for consent and it was seconded
 
04:53:06.350 --> 04:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
okay without objection consent is it is
 
04:53:10.990 --> 04:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
I'll close the executive section on 326
 
04:53:13.948 --> 04:53:13.958 align:start position:0%
um so it's we're actually doing okay
 
04:53:18.510 --> 04:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
even though it doesn't always look it um
 
04:53:19.830 --> 04:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a break for a few
 
04:53:21.510 --> 04:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
minutes we just got a fresh Amendment
 
04:53:24.070 --> 04:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
for 140 I'd like the members to have an
 
04:53:25.230 --> 04:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
04:53:27.910 --> 04:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
review and there is the
 
04:53:30.868 --> 04:53:30.878 align:start position:0%
potential for some further work on a
 
04:53:32.708 --> 04:53:32.718 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
04:53:34.788 --> 04:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
others and it's time to stretch from
 
04:53:37.990 --> 04:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
minute anyway so give us a it is 10 of
 
04:53:41.470 --> 04:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
now actually that's probably not right
 
04:53:41.480 --> 04:53:43.628 align:start position:0%
now actually that's probably not right
it's

04:53:43.628 --> 04:53:43.638 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:53:47.270 --> 04:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
252 wow somebody changed the clocks um
 
04:53:49.070 --> 04:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
what do we do this
 
04:53:52.548 --> 04:53:52.558 align:start position:0%
uh we will go back in we'll take a break
 
04:53:52.558 --> 04:53:54.230 align:start position:0%
uh we will go back in we'll take a break
until

04:53:54.230 --> 04:53:54.240 align:start position:0%

autism spectrum uh trauma and stress
 
05:16:49.270 --> 05:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
related disorder much the same way um
 
05:16:51.830 --> 05:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
persons with autism spectrum uh
 
05:16:54.270 --> 05:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
disabilities can have escalated
 
05:16:55.670 --> 05:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
Encounters of somebody doesn't know
 
05:16:57.310 --> 05:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
their triggers and know how to uh
 
05:16:58.910 --> 05:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
interact with them in order to
 
05:17:01.110 --> 05:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
deescalate uh persons with stress
 
05:17:03.150 --> 05:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
Related Disorders have many of the same
 
05:17:06.868 --> 05:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
symptoms in terms of uh the tendency to
 
05:17:09.430 --> 05:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
escalate if they're not handled in in a
 
05:17:13.190 --> 05:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
favorable Manner and rather than adding
 
05:17:15.150 --> 05:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
more envelop envelopes and other
 
05:17:16.590 --> 05:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
problems after discussing this with the
 
05:17:19.110 --> 05:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
bill sponsors uh it was agreed that this
 
05:17:21.510 --> 05:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
would be a good tack on so that it could
 
05:17:24.430 --> 05:17:24.440 align:start position:0%
cover all persons who may have uh have
 
05:17:26.868 --> 05:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
issues with escalation in what would
 
05:17:30.070 --> 05:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise be a routine traffic
 
05:17:34.030 --> 05:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
stop thank you sir any questions on the
 
05:17:37.030 --> 05:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
amendment offand from your conversations
 
05:17:39.430 --> 05:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
um would would this language also
 
05:17:43.590 --> 05:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
incover uh TBI uh traumatic brain
 
05:17:47.470 --> 05:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
injury so to your question um a stress
 
05:17:50.430 --> 05:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
related disorder is not necessarily in
 
05:17:52.230 --> 05:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
line with a traumatic brain injury but
 
05:17:54.510 --> 05:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
often they are and most of the time
 
05:17:56.190 --> 05:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
somebody with a traumatic brain injury
 
05:17:58.750 --> 05:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
is treated for a stress related disorder
 
05:18:02.910 --> 05:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
in addition to TBI excellent thank you
 
05:18:04.628 --> 05:18:04.638 align:start position:0%
anything else or anybody else on the
 
05:18:07.430 --> 05:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
amendment itself represent Stakes yeah
 
05:18:09.510 --> 05:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to uh speak in support of the
 
05:18:11.868 --> 05:18:11.878 align:start position:0%
amendment um I think it's a really good
 
05:18:16.470 --> 05:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
step for us to take um and I do so for I
 
05:18:18.310 --> 05:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
I will actually share with everybody for
 
05:18:21.350 --> 05:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
personal reasons um those of you who
 
05:18:23.788 --> 05:18:23.798 align:start position:0%
know me well know that I ended up being
 
05:18:26.110 --> 05:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
deployed to the country of Haiti right
 
05:18:27.510 --> 05:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
after the earthquake for the
 
05:18:29.030 --> 05:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
International Federation of the Red
 
05:18:32.030 --> 05:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
Cross red crescent um it was two years
 
05:18:34.590 --> 05:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
of people shooting at me not personally
 
05:18:38.110 --> 05:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
of course but people shooting at me um
 
05:18:40.430 --> 05:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
no family support system dead bodies in
 
05:18:43.670 --> 05:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
the street uh Starving Children and when
 
05:18:47.708 --> 05:18:47.718 align:start position:0%
I came back from that I was a absolute
 
05:18:50.390 --> 05:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
wreck thank goodness I had a spouse who
 
05:18:53.590 --> 05:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
was willing to put up with me and I know
 
05:18:55.470 --> 05:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to all laugh at this but
 
05:18:59.390 --> 05:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
actually um a big part of the Salvation
 
05:19:01.150 --> 05:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
was that someone asked me to run for the
 
05:19:03.510 --> 05:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
legislature so I had something to do
 
05:19:06.750 --> 05:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
that seemed worthwhile that
 
05:19:10.190 --> 05:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't um bringing back the bad memories
 
05:19:12.708 --> 05:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
of of all that work so I think this is a
 
05:19:14.750 --> 05:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
really good thing to do because it's a
 
05:19:15.708 --> 05:19:15.718 align:start position:0%
it is
 
05:19:19.110 --> 05:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
a if you haven't walked in those shoes
 
05:19:21.830 --> 05:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's a really really hard thing for
 
05:19:24.070 --> 05:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
people to understand and this will help
 
05:19:24.080 --> 05:19:28.390 align:start position:0%
people to understand and this will help
with

05:19:28.390 --> 05:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:31.070 --> 05:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
understanding anybody else from the
 
05:19:32.628 --> 05:19:32.638 align:start position:0%
committee on the
 
05:19:34.948 --> 05:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
amendment okay seeing none I just want
 
05:19:48.350 --> 05:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:49.830 --> 05:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
okay so I just wanted to confirm it's
 
05:19:51.190 --> 05:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
always been and it still is I just
 
05:19:52.750 --> 05:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure on an amendment for
 
05:19:54.750 --> 05:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
those of you who are new and we don't
 
05:19:56.670 --> 05:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
not have to roll call it unless we think
 
05:19:58.070 --> 05:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to be contentious we can
 
05:20:00.230 --> 05:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
always roll call it in this case I'm
 
05:20:02.390 --> 05:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
going to say we're probably okay with a
 
05:20:04.350 --> 05:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
Voice vote so on
 
05:20:06.310 --> 05:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh
 
05:20:11.030 --> 05:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
0129 H all those in favor say I I oppose
 
05:20:13.390 --> 05:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
nay okay so we'll consider that
 
05:20:16.230 --> 05:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
unanimous adoption of the amendment uh
 
05:20:18.390 --> 05:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
now the motion on the floor is ought to
 
05:20:21.910 --> 05:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
pass as amended on House Bill 140 uh any
 
05:20:26.030 --> 05:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the amended Bill
 
05:20:28.190 --> 05:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
05:20:30.310 --> 05:20:30.320 align:start position:0%

05:20:34.070 --> 05:20:34.080 align:start position:0%

05:20:37.910 --> 05:20:37.920 align:start position:0%

Miller yes and chairman Walsh yes 16 to
zero

05:21:09.830 --> 05:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:12.190 --> 05:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
was a very small fiscal note
 
05:21:16.270 --> 05:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:16.280 --> 05:21:18.510 align:start position:0%
 
140

05:21:18.510 --> 05:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
140
 
05:21:21.350 --> 05:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
10,000,000 could consent what we'll do
 
05:21:22.910 --> 05:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
is the same what we'll do is the same
 
05:21:24.548 --> 05:21:24.558 align:start position:0%
thing before okay our recommendation of
 
05:21:26.910 --> 05:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
all to passes amended is adopted 160
 
05:21:29.868 --> 05:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
unanimous uh I did hear a motion for
 
05:21:34.510 --> 05:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
consent what's that consent uh and so is
 
05:21:36.590 --> 05:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
SE so without objection I believe this
 
05:21:39.030 --> 05:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
meets threshold to go on consent
 
05:21:41.030 --> 05:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh if it doesn't it won't be there and
 
05:21:44.230 --> 05:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
if you don't if it's not that's why uh
 
05:21:46.750 --> 05:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
but I think I'm but the
 
05:21:49.070 --> 05:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
consious what's that do you want it on
 
05:21:50.948 --> 05:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
consent or you I would I would like it
 
05:21:50.958 --> 05:22:00.230 align:start position:0%
consent or you I would I would like it
on

05:22:00.230 --> 05:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:03.390 --> 05:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
consent well there's um an option I
 
05:22:04.750 --> 05:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
guess I mean I
 
05:22:07.990 --> 05:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
heard a motion for consent and a second
 
05:22:09.270 --> 05:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:22:11.110 --> 05:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to it put it on
 
05:22:13.310 --> 05:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
regular calendar and speak to it I would
 
05:22:16.910 --> 05:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
I okay I would I think I think that my
 
05:22:20.430 --> 05:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
message is an important one I the other
 
05:22:22.350 --> 05:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
thing that this is actually really hard
 
05:22:24.670 --> 05:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
for me even just now just to talk about
 
05:22:28.830 --> 05:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
this um the other thing is that when you
 
05:22:31.788 --> 05:22:31.798 align:start position:0%
when you are suffering that
 
05:22:35.150 --> 05:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
way you you don't even recognize that
 
05:22:39.470 --> 05:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's what's going on and when somebody
 
05:22:40.830 --> 05:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
throws you a
 
05:22:44.230 --> 05:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
lifeline and this is in my mind a
 
05:22:46.150 --> 05:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
Lifeline that people can carry with them
 
05:22:49.948 --> 05:22:49.958 align:start position:0%
that will help um it's so important so
 
05:22:52.110 --> 05:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
important and I would be happy to
 
05:22:54.628 --> 05:22:54.638 align:start position:0%
educate the floor of the house about why
 
05:22:56.310 --> 05:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
this is why this is an important
 
05:23:02.708 --> 05:23:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:06.510 --> 05:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
people fair enough so uh what we can do
 
05:23:08.150 --> 05:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll put it on the regular
 
05:23:10.830 --> 05:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
calendar that's easy um and I'll have
 
05:23:14.030 --> 05:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
the two of you work on whether it's uh
 
05:23:15.708 --> 05:23:15.718 align:start position:0%
the the speech itself or the the
 
05:23:18.390 --> 05:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
Parliamentary inquiry so we'll work
 
05:23:20.868 --> 05:23:20.878 align:start position:0%
together on that okay um so in summary
 
05:23:22.548 --> 05:23:22.558 align:start position:0%
regular calend letter is ought to pass
 
05:23:25.948 --> 05:23:25.958 align:start position:0%
this amendment on on 140 I'll close the
 
05:23:25.958 --> 05:23:33.670 align:start position:0%
this amendment on on 140 I'll close the
executive

05:23:33.670 --> 05:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:33.680 --> 05:23:36.070 align:start position:0%
 
session

05:23:36.070 --> 05:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
session
 
05:23:40.510 --> 05:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:42.390 --> 05:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
as I said earlier 182 we're going to
 
05:23:49.590 --> 05:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:10.310 --> 05:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:11.628 --> 05:24:11.638 align:start position:0%
all right so we're going to add House
 
05:24:16.868 --> 05:24:16.878 align:start position:0%
Bill 298 to the ones uh
 
05:24:19.470 --> 05:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
I again was not here last week and I do
 
05:24:21.510 --> 05:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
apologize but uh in looking at it again
 
05:24:24.030 --> 05:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
today I think it needs some more work I
 
05:24:25.430 --> 05:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't support it the way it is so
 
05:24:27.230 --> 05:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to push that one off I'll
 
05:24:29.990 --> 05:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
reschedule that one for next week as
 
05:24:33.350 --> 05:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
well but this is um again it's our only
 
05:24:37.110 --> 05:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
our first um executive session this term
 
05:24:39.470 --> 05:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
and it's a good opportunity to show with
 
05:24:40.590 --> 05:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
some of the ones that we've been waiting
 
05:24:42.548 --> 05:24:42.558 align:start position:0%
for amendments when we go through these
 
05:24:44.110 --> 05:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
bills in the hearings from here on and
 
05:24:45.948 --> 05:24:45.958 align:start position:0%
if you see one that takes where you've
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
got concerns with at any time you want
 
05:24:51.310 --> 05:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
to suggest or recommend uh whether it's
 
05:24:53.910 --> 05:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee reach out to me we can
 
05:24:55.510 --> 05:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
put a put two or three people together
 
05:24:59.030 --> 05:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
well three for a subcommittee uh or if
 
05:25:01.070 --> 05:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
you think that's something that you've
 
05:25:03.390 --> 05:25:03.400 align:start position:0%
got an issue with in a bill don't
 
05:25:05.030 --> 05:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
hesitate to get moving on an amendment
 
05:25:06.990 --> 05:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
and I can help you through that process
 
05:25:09.110 --> 05:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
as well if you haven't done it yet
 
05:25:10.548 --> 05:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
that way when we get to our executive
 
05:25:12.270 --> 05:25:12.280 align:start position:0%
sessions once they're scheduled we've
 
05:25:15.070 --> 05:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
got the information we need rather than
 
05:25:16.510 --> 05:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
rescheduling and rescheduling and
