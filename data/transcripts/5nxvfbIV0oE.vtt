represent the towns of bow and
 
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 align:start position:0%
hopkington I filed this bill at the
 
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
request of constituents to make a small
 
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
change to the state retire insurance
 
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
plan eligibility that will yield several
 
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
important benefits currently the state
 
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
retire insurance plan allows coverage
 
00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 align:start position:0%
for 19 to 25y old children if they are
 
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
full-time students this bill seeks the
 
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
simple change of removing the full-time
 
00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
student requirement to allow coverage of
 
00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 align:start position:0%
all children within this age group this
 
00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 align:start position:0%
change brings the retiree plan in
 
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
alignment with current state employee
 
00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 align:start position:0%
plans and other ACA plans importantly
 
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
this change will not cost New Hampshire
 
00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayers a single penny all premiums
 
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 align:start position:0%
will be paid by the retiree and not the
 
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
state additionally 19 to 25 year olds
 
00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
tend to be healthier and therefore cost
 
00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
less to ensure which means that adding
 
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
these healthier individuals to the
 
00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 align:start position:0%
insurance pool Joyce Pitman the director
 
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
of risk and benefits lays out this out
 
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
well in her testimony which I submitted
 
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
which I passed around this
 
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
morning in fact this change May decrease
 
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
State costs because the department of
 
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
administrative Services won't have to
 
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
verify eligibility based on uh being a
 
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
student just age which is easier to
 
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 align:start position:0%
track and changes with 100%
 
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 align:start position:0%
predictability two other potential
 
00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 align:start position:0%
benefits albeit un Quan unquantifiable
 
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
are that this benefit enhancement could
 
00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
Aid in hiring essential state employees
 
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
or encourage decisions to retire
 
00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 align:start position:0%

Newsome uh this is his first bill
 
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
introduction so so I can think of no
 
00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
better committee for a uh for a first uh
 
00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
first term uh legislator to you know cut
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
their teeth but here in the Commerce
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
Committee so is that enough sucking
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
right well the the problem is is that
 
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
yeah and I'm represent pus chair
 
00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
pus I'm the only person in the room who
 
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
remembers when we did if full-time
 
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
students when we removed it for
 
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
insurance right right was and so so I
 
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
don't need to ask any questions because
 
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
I know the whole history around that
 
00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
limitation right no and and all I wanted
 
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
to point out for um um for the members
 
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee is that um the the
 
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
state retiree health insurance plan is
 
00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
is um captured in statute so it's
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
defined in statute uh in um
 
00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 align:start position:0%
where we um RSA
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
21i uh and and so it removes just the
 
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
words if full-time student so it removes
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
that limitation from from the statute
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
and um and according to um uh director
 
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
pitman's testimony it affects very very
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
few um retirees and um and as her
 
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
testimony goes on it uh it has no cost
 
00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 align:start position:0%
to the to the state and As Nice benefit
 
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%

22 I'm here today to introduce HB 648
 
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
which seeks to require commercial
 
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:16.360 align:start position:0%

name for blood sugar glucose monitoring
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
is essential to diabetes management and
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
safety I'm going to give you a quick
 
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
background on Diabetes because I don't
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
know how much you all know um and then
 
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
explain the merits of this proposed
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
legislation diabetes is serious costly
 
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
common treatable and bipartisan
 
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
condition there is no cure at this time
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
98300 or so New Hampshire residents have
 
00:31:51.549 --> 00:31:51.559 align:start position:0%
been diagnosed with diabetes that's
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
about 9% of our adult population another
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
29,000 have undiagnosed diabetes and
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
about 88,200 of those folks with
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
undiagnosed diabetes are diagnosed
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
annually so we are increasingly
 
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
recognizing people's status with
 
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
diabetes and there is a whopping 350,000
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire people about 30% of our
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
population that have a condition called
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
pre-diabetes that's when your blood
 
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
sugar level is higher than normal but
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
not yet at the diagnosis level
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
pre-diabetes is likely to become
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
diabetes if it's not recognized and
 
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:31.480 align:start position:0%
addressed in uh Medical
 
00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:34.039 align:start position:0%
Care medical expenses for people with
 
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
diabetes are about two and a half times
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
what people without diabetes have that's
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
data from American Diabetes
 
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
Association so what is it it's a chronic
 
00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
illness in which the pancreas does not
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
produce enough insulin or the insulin
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
that is produced does not work
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
adequately because of this untreated or
 
00:32:56.909 --> 00:32:56.919 align:start position:0%
inadequately managed diabetes results in
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
high blood sugars and that can lead to
 
00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
very serious
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
complications in addition to not feeling
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
very well when your blood sugar is high
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
for many people with diabetes but not
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
all some people don't really even notice
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
that their blood sugar is high it can
 
00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
lead to heart disease kidney failure
 
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
painful neuropathy which can also affect
 
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
your Mobility vision loss and blindness
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
are the most common complications of
 
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
diabetes pretty sure nobody here wants
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
any of those things for us or our
 
00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
constituents with today's knowledge and
 
00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:30.519 align:start position:0%
treatment options complications are
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
largely preventable at least in people
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
diagnosed now not so much in people
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
who've had diabetes a long time and may
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
already have some damage or they can at
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
least be delayed and be less severe so
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
there's really a lot that we can do to
 
00:33:46.629 --> 00:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
help people with
 
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:48.919 align:start position:0%
diabetes in order for diabetes to
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
adequately be managed the patient needs
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
to have ongoing knowledge of their blood
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
sugar so that they can make healthy
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
treatment and lifestyle decisions
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
multiple times a day
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
there's some variance in the types of
 
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
diabetes and the way they're treated and
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
the relevance to this bill type 1
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
diabetes requires the patient to take
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
external insulin either by injections or
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
by a pump it affects about 10% of people
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
with diabetes glucose monitoring devices
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
and supplies are largely already covered
 
00:34:22.109 --> 00:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
by insurers for type 1 diabetes so that
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
is not included in this build uh there's
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
not a
 
00:34:28.829 --> 00:34:28.839 align:start position:0%
need people with type two two diabetes
 
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
have insulin resistance which means that
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
their bodies don't utilize insulin
 
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
effectively this is the most common type
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
of Diabetes almost 90% of patients with
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
diabetes have type 2 it's strongly
 
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
hereditary it is treated with diet
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
exercise and medications the medications
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
may or may not include insulin depending
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
on the patient's status and needs and
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
then the third type that I'll mention is
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
gational diabetes which is diabetes Di
 
00:34:59.069 --> 00:34:59.079 align:start position:0%
AG noosed during
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
pregnancy if not treated it results in
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
larg babies more difficult deliveries
 
00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:07.079 align:start position:0%
increased risk to both mother and child
 
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
and you'll hear a bit more about that
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
from one of my
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
colleagues this bill addresses glucose

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
diabetes type 2 diabetes is a
 
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
progressive disease when first diagnosed
 
00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:24.599 align:start position:0%
many people with type two can keep their
 
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
blood glucose at a healthy level with a
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
combination of meal planning nutrition
 
00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge physical activity and taking
 
00:35:34.109 --> 00:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
oral medication pills of which there are
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
a number of different options that work
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
in different ways but over time the body
 
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
gradually produces less and less of its
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
own insulin and uses it less and less
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
well or less and less effectively and
 
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
eventually lifestyle efforts and oral
 
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
medication may not be enough to keep
 
00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:56.599 align:start position:0%
blood glucose levels in a healthy range
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
and at that point in the past patients
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
were prescribed insulin because that
 
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
used to be the only option when the oral
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
medications and lifestyle measures
 
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
didn't work now we have a whole toolbox
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
of a variety of different kinds of
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
medication um Beyond pills injectables
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
that are daily or weekly that are
 
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
helpful in managing blood
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
sugars understanding the realities of
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
diabetes is crucial for effec management
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
and a healthier life managing diabetes
 
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
isn't just about taking medication it's
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
about maintaining a balanced lifestyle
 
00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
and making informed daily
 
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
choices there are at least 40 variables
 
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
that affect blood
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
glucose I decided not to copy this page
 
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
for all of you but I would be happy to
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
share it there's just so many pieces of
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
paper for reps right but among these in
 
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
addition to the obvious the many
 
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
different parts of nutrition like
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
carbohydrate quantity carbohydrate type
 
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
fat both quantity and type protein
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
caffeine alcohol the timing of eating
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
hydration or lack thereof your personal
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
microbiome we're actually learning more
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
and more that what happens in the gut
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
affects blood sugars and the way that we
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
manage um
 
00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
medications so that's one category of
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
factors that affect blood glucose then
 
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
medication including what the medication
 
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
is what the dose is what the timing is
 
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:28.839 align:start position:0%
whether there's interaction c s if the
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
patient needs steroid treatment for some
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
other condition that is almost certain
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
to aggravate blood sugar control not
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
always in a completely predictable way
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
um people who might be taking nasin
 
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
which is vitamin B3 which is sometimes
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
recommended for the neuropathy
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
complication but unfortunately nasin
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
also causes increased blood sugar so
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's a bit of a catch
 
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
22 I won't detail all of these but
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
activity also makes a big difference
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
essentially exercise lowers blood
 
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
sugar while you're exercising and there
 
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
can also be a post exercise effect hours
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
later that you can have an unexpected
 
00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
decrease in blood sugar from the healthy
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
good exercise you did earlier in the day
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
the intensity the duration of the
 
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
exercise the relationship of when it
 
00:38:20.589 --> 00:38:20.599 align:start position:0%
happens relative to when you ate and
 
00:38:23.069 --> 00:38:23.079 align:start position:0%
then a
 
00:38:26.829 --> 00:38:26.839 align:start position:0%
um dozen and a half list of biological
 
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
variables including sleep
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:37.160 align:start position:0%

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
literally goes on and on not every
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
person with diabetes has issues with all
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
of these factors that affect blood
 
00:38:52.109 --> 00:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
glucose but the point really is to say
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
there are so many variables it is
 
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
different for every patient and it is
 
00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:55.950 align:start position:0%
different for every patient and it is
not

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:38:58.589 --> 00:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
consistent Within one patient all of the
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
time you simply can't know how your
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
blood sugar is doing except by testing
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
it you cannot consistently and reliably
 
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
feel a common risk without adequate
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
glucose monitoring is
 
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
Hypoglycemia hypoglycemia is profoundly
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
low blood sugar that impairs cognition
 
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
and if it's not treated it will
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately cause loss of consciousness
 
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
hypo can occur slowly or
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
rapidly there can be symptoms that alert
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
you that it's happening but not
 
00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:37.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily the longer someone has had
 
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
diabetes and the more episodes of low
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
blood sugar that they have experienced
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
the more likely that they will have what
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
we call hypoglycemia unawareness so
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
their blood sugar is dropping and they
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
have no perception that that is
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
happening so they're not going to do
 
00:39:52.309 --> 00:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
anything about treating it because
 
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
they're not aware there's anything to
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
the um anecdote that I will share about
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
that because it will forever stay in my
 
00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
mind I had a patient who was a
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
logger he was in his 50s he was a hearty
 
00:40:13.069 --> 00:40:13.079 align:start position:0%
guy he was trying to pay decent
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
attention to taking care of his diabetes
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
he lost some weight you know he's trying
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
to do a reasonably good
 
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
job he was however not very committed to
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
blood sugar monitoring at the time the
 
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
only approach to blood sugar monitoring
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
was what we call finger stick you've
 
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
probably seen this advertised on TV you
 
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
poke your finger you get a teeny tiny
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
drop blood it goes on a test strip
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
reacts with a a chemical in the strip
 
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
and gets read by a little device that's
 
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
half the size of your cell phone but you
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
have to do that periodically he was not
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
committed to doing that he experienced
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
low blood sugar multiple times while he
 
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
was operating a
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
chainsaw he was a really hard worker and
 
00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
he would push himself to complete the
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
tasks at hand he would not be aware of
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
going low until he would
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
collapse one day he came into my office
 
00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
and he said well I threw the saw aside
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
like I always do when I started to fall
 
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
down and it hit my
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
boot good thing he was wearing steel
 
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
toed boots and it just scarred his boot
 
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
because he would have lost all or part
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
of his foot from hypoglycemia on
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
awareness that he didn't know he was
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
going low until he started to literally
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
crash um
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
it wasn't too long after that that
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
continuous glucose monitors became more
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
available which is largely what we're
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
going to speak about in this bill and
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
once he had a continuous glucose monitor
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
they will alert
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
you just like a cellphone alert that
 
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
your blood sugar is dropping and they
 
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
will communicate how rapidly is it
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
dropping gradually or
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
abruptly he thought I was God because I
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
got him a
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
CGM I most definitely am not God um um
 
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
but it really was phenomenal to see the
 
00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
difference in his ability to make good
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
decisions about his
 
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
care um let's see I have actually
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
already said that oh in the past when
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
lifestyle and pills were not adequate to
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
manage a patient's blood sugar as I
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
noted the only further treatment option
 
00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
used to be insulin insulin can very
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
effectively control blood sugar but it
 
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
also makes it harder for people to
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
control their weight which is a very
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
very common concern in type 2 diabetes
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
not all but most people with type two
 
00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
diabetes are overweight when they're
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
diagnosed overweight increases the risk
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
of diabetes complications especially
 
00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:38.839 align:start position:0%
heart disease so now we have wonderful
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
medications that can replace insulin
 
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
treatment in many people with type 2
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
diabetes managing blood sugar as well or
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
better than insulin and actually helping
 
00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:51.559 align:start position:0%
with Weight Control these are the same
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
meds we're hearing a lot about that
 
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
people are using and are very interested
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
in for weight control independent
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
diabetes and many of them are injectable
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
meds patients taking these meds patients
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
who have diabetes do have risk of
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
hypoglycemia from them in the similar
 
00:43:11.069 --> 00:43:11.079 align:start position:0%
way as with insulin and therefore need
 
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
to monitor their blood sugars to be
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
safe one of the other situations where
 
00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
hypoglycemia becomes very serious is
 
00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
when you're driving if you have low
 
00:43:21.549 --> 00:43:21.559 align:start position:0%
blood sugar profound low blood sugar
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
while you're driving you'll drive like
 
00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:25.640 align:start position:0%
you have DWI and in fact there are
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
multiple documented cases is over many
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
many years of people being stopped for
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
erratic driving or having been in an
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
accident and the law enforcement and
 
00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
First Responders think they're impaired
 
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
by alcohol and they may have had nothing
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
at all to drink it's that their blood
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
sugar is
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
low we noted the traditional way to
 
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
check blood sugar with a finger stick or
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me the Contemporary and very
 
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
useful alternative continuous glucose
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
monitoring is wearing a sensor they're
 
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
very small about the size of a quarter
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
often worn on your shoulder and it
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
inserts into the skin just into the
 
00:44:09.309 --> 00:44:09.319 align:start position:0%
subcutaneous tissue right underneath the
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
skin and they're worn for 7 to 14 days
 
00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
and then you have to replace the
 
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
sensor they assess your blood sugar
 
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
status all the time
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
247 and the information can either be
 
00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:25.559 align:start position:0%
received simply by taking your phone and
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
just swipe like that and look at it and
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
it'll tell you what's your blood sugar
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
right this minute um or it can go to an
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
app and be communicated also to other
 
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
people so like a spouse might be helpful
 
00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
in monitoring somebody's blood sugar if
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
they want them to and they could receive
 
00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
well and we spoke about them alerting
 
00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
the patient when your uh glucose is
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
dropping or Rising very significantly
 
00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
telling excuse me
 
00:44:59.710 --> 00:44:59.720 align:start position:0%
how quickly the change is happening
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
which is very beneficial for preventing
 
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:03.640 align:start position:0%
hypoglycemia it's also very beneficial
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
for being able to make plans let's say
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
you're in committee and there's only one
 
00:45:09.549 --> 00:45:09.559 align:start position:0%
more build to here but you're running
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
late the chair decides we're not
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
breaking for lunch yet if you're a
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
person with diabetes and you don't know
 
00:45:16.109 --> 00:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
what your blood sugar is that might not
 
00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:18.839 align:start position:0%
be okay because you may be dropping and
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
you may need to
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
eat um one of my colleagues excuse me is
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
going to speak more about gestational
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
diabetes I'm just going to note that the
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
significance of gational diabetes of
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
cgms and gational diabetes is largely
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
because of the concise time frame of
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
that condition pregnancy obviously ends
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
most gational diabetes is diagnosed at
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
six or seven months of pregnancy so you
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
have a very short time frame for that
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
patient to get informed about how to
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
take care of the blood sugar for
 
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
themselves and The Unborn so there's an
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
urgency to having that information in an
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
efficient and timely
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
manner continuous glucose monitoring
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
saves lives it has great return on
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
investment and we need to be covered by
 
00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
insurers so that patients can access it
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
routinely for all type two people and
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
for all people with gational
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
diabetes thank you very much for your
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
time I am happy to try to answer
 
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
questions um and then have support from
 
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
folks behind
 
00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.510 align:start position:0%
folks behind
me

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh excuse me represent are you are
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
yeah well generally we don't but since
 
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
you're not
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
testifying I know but generally you're
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
you're not supposed to be asking
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
question normally you turn to someone
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
next to you and have them ask the
 
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
question then that's not a good question
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
but I will give you I'll let you off
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
this one time you get one question
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
better make it
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
good thank you Mr
 
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
chair so here's my question thank you is
 
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
I can't see over the this thing thank
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
you uh when we when last
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
when when last we spoke of this which
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
was admittedly quite a while ago uh we
 
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
were provided by the insurance
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
department a pretty
 
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
detailed uh analysis is of where the
 
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
costs were regarding this C the
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
CGM and we worked out the numbers and
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
figured out how much it would cost per
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
patient or per
 
00:47:41.549 --> 00:47:41.559 align:start position:0%
prescriber and said okay that's within a
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
realm of reasonableness and so it looked
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
it looked good but there's two two
 
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
questions I have for you one is on page
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
two line one and two it said Pro it says
 
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
cover coverage under this paragraph
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
shall be provided without regard to the
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
form of treatment I'd like you to say
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
something without the prescribed form or
 
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know something to make it sound like
 
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
it's medical it's not somebody just
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
going and having a whim is that yes um
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think it
 
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
would be absolutely fine to amend the
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
bill to include the word prescribed in
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
line one on page two that is in fact
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
what we mean the point of that statement
 
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
is that when cgms first came out and in
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
some insurance coverage still
 
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
today they were
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
only covered for people who were using
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
insulin who were needing insulin so this
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
newer but by no means brand new
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
generation of meds that are not insulin
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
are very helpful for blood sugar control
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
and weight
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
management if we don't specify that we
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
want cgms ailable to people with other
 
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
forms of treatment besides insulin it
 
00:49:02.589 --> 00:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
might get limited to just insulin which
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be very helpful frankly it
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
would be better follow on to that so
 
00:49:09.549 --> 00:49:09.559 align:start position:0%
prescribe would be great just okay let
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
me let me just try you're gonna okay let
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
me try Okay so I'm on met Foreman now
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
because I I hit
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
6.5 and I assume which by changing the
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
form of regardless the form of treatment
 
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
is you want to allow me to be able to
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
take advantage of this mandate that is
 
00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.190 align:start position:0%
take advantage of this mandate that is
correct

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:49:35.789 --> 00:49:35.799 align:start position:0%
that okay may I explain I'm a quick
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
study yes go first of all kudos to you
 
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
for respecting your condition and taking
 
00:49:44.589 --> 00:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
good care of it it really makes such a
 
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
difference it because otherwise I was
 
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
going to have to stop you know she
 
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
wanted me on keto bread and and all this
 
00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:53.079 align:start position:0%
other stuff that I just no that was not
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
going to work for me so if I was still
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
in practice I'd give you by card ser but
 
00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.030 align:start position:0%
in practice I'd give you by card ser but
not

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
um the more information in general that
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
people have about their blood sugar
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
status the more likely that they make
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
smart decisions about how to take care
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
of it so a quick for instance I remember
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
this patient with type two diabetes also
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
on met
 
00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.670 align:start position:0%
on met
Foreman

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
Foreman
 
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
um she got a trial CGM when there was a
 
00:50:21.549 --> 00:50:21.559 align:start position:0%
loner program from one of the companies
 
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
for Just Two Weeks literally was blown
 
00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
away by her increased
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
understanding of the different impact of
 
00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.109 align:start position:0%
understanding of the different impact of
portion

00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
portion
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
size that she concluded she could eat
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
ice cream after dinner every night if
 
00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
she ate a half cup she could manage her
 
00:50:40.109 --> 00:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
blood sugar well and if she ate what she
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
had previously been eating which was a
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
good bit more it's not surprising that
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
the quantity would make the blood sugar
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
higher but the quantitative data of it
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
made it this much higher made it
 
00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
unacceptable to her to continue doing
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
that so cgms are value for people
 
00:50:59.230 --> 00:50:59.240 align:start position:0%
regardless of form of
 
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
treatment okay so here comes the
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
question that I really want to
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
ask um 6.5 means i' you I was 6.4
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
marginal you know so I'm now in and out
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
of A1C okay now not withstanding that
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
when it came to blood sugars they they
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
moved the goalpost back when it was 130
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
and then they went to 100 okay and at
 
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
that point yes I stared to take those
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
glucose test kits um but uh the my
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
insurance company wouldn't cover it uh
 
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
because um I it wasn't it was the A1C I
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
had to get my A1C number up high enough
 
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
to to do it the glucose number so here's
 
00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
my real my question is is that in terms
 
00:51:49.069 --> 00:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
of where is the proper threshold here
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
for these to have us mandate this more
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
expensive device testing now you might
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
argue I don't know that given that the
 
00:52:02.349 --> 00:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
cost of these test kits it's it it was
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
like know over the counter it's $80 for
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
like 50 of them okay and and that was
 
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent Walmart and and
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
Hanford um it uh I did find $40 at
 
00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
Amazon ironically um however so but
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
insurance companies cover it if you have
 
00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
if you're up a certain
 
00:52:28.349 --> 00:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
level my question question is I was I
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
was the whole all of this is all driven
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
by my doing a uh you know uh a fasting
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
test at my doctor's okay so in my mind
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
that the time for me to be taking this
 
00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
test is in the morning before I eat or
 
00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
drink or do anything so in my mind this
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
thing that you're talking about this
 
00:52:58.030 --> 00:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
monitor which is monitoring all day long
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
okay is really not addressing what my
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
original diagnosis was based upon which
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
was a fasting test okay so the question
 
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
is and and you're hit it right on the
 
00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
thing is you know regard the form of
 
00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
treatment it's at what level of diabetes
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
of type two diabetes you
 
00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
have what is it the before we really you
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
really need to have this monitoring
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's monitoring you 247 seven rather
 
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
than just you know taking your blood in
 
00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
you know uh once a morning if you were
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
going to be that crazy about doing it
 
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
 
00:53:38.349 --> 00:53:38.359 align:start position:0%
question just a quick background because
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
I didn't mention A1C in my remarks and
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
so in case any of the folks listening
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
are not familiar with that A1C is a
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
blood test that measures average BL
 
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
average blood glucose over about a
 
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
two-month period of time it's not
 
00:53:55.829 --> 00:53:55.839 align:start position:0%
actually an average but for Simplicity
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
and explaining it we say that it's a
 
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:03.640 align:start position:0%
Marvel right um and so it is one of the
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
measures of whether diabetes is well
 
00:54:09.789 --> 00:54:09.799 align:start position:0%
controlled people who don't have
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
diabetes have an A1C between 4.8 and
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
5.7 and it can go up I think the highest
 
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
one I ever saw was 21 which was pretty
 
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
awful um that person was clearly not
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
very well at that point um one of the
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
limitations of A1 see is it doesn't tell
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
you how your blood sugar is ranging
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the day so because it is
 
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
essentially an
 
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
average you can have a so if you think
 
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
of it like grades in school if you got a
 
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
50 on one test and a 100 on another your
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
average is
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
75 but clearly you did terrible on one
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
particular day and very well on another
 
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
so similarly with A1C the range could be
 
00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
that you're having lows and you're
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
having a highs and you're when C is
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
coming out okay that's not necessarily
 
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
the case but it can
 
00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:06.829 align:start position:0%
the case but it can
be

00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
I I don't think I am the best person to
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
answer what that threshold should
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
be um because I haven't been in practice
 
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
for two and a half well a little over
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
two years there may be folks here who
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
have some input on that and if not I
 
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
would be happy to get back to the
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
committee with the clinical guidelines
 
00:55:29.069 --> 00:55:29.079 align:start position:0%
lines and a
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation I'm respectful of the
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
impact of required um of requirements on
 
00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and I don't want to
 
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
make this so expensive that we can't get
 
00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
it into law and help
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
people in the ideal World which of
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
course doesn't exist but if we had
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
unlimited funds I'd say everybody should
 
00:55:52.029 --> 00:55:52.039 align:start position:0%
have it because they learn so much about
 
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
it and then they don't develop expensive
 
00:55:56.829 --> 00:55:56.839 align:start position:0%
complications so regardless of whether
 
00:55:59.870 --> 00:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
your A1C was 6.5 or
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
7.2 it logically makes sense to have but
 
00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:05.559 align:start position:0%
we don't live in a world with unlimited
 
00:56:08.109 --> 00:56:08.119 align:start position:0%
resources so I will seek a better answer
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
to that okay but in this case the device
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about is just doing
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
blood sugar it's not doing
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
A1C that is correct and we know that
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
your blood sugars can vary all day long
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
yes so the first time I got my little
 
00:56:26.109 --> 00:56:26.119 align:start position:0%
kit which is you know you say as small
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
as it's even smaller than that it's very
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
small yeah right picking you know
 
00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
pinning my skin was not a big got one it
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
specialized it it's just the right level
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's just it's really minor in my mind
 
00:56:41.029 --> 00:56:41.039 align:start position:0%
the guy was probably afraid of blood but
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
at any rate um that that I I was taking
 
00:56:49.029 --> 00:56:49.039 align:start position:0%
it all day long I really wanted to see
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
how much my blood sugar
 
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
fluctuated okay were you surp oh I'm
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm curious to ask if you were
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
surprised sometimes at what you saw when
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
you checked uh the the worst case I ever
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
got and and and I I announced I had
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
probably more than I should have had to
 
00:57:08.829 --> 00:57:08.839 align:start position:0%
drink and I had I had one of those high
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
sugar high sugar drinks you know uh that
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
you know that's like Mike's Hard
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
Lemonade that's got like
 
00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:19.799 align:start position:0%
236 sugars in it and it was dessert and
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
every it was the worst possible time and
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
I my number was
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
236 that's as high get it just to
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
highlight from that wonderful example
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
among those variables that affect blood
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
sugar alcohol mostly lowers blood sugar
 
00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
not like we'd say to a patient drink
 
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
more to lower your sugar but nonset
 
00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:41.799 align:start position:0%
alcoholic beverages mostly result in a
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
lower blood sugar but not in a
 
00:57:47.069 --> 00:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
predictable time frame and way beer
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
usually raises blood sugar but not uh
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
uniformly and super sweet drinks like a
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
a mar
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
K who knows what's going to happen
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
236 or
 
00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:07.559 align:start position:0%
457 so okay uh any other questions from
 
00:58:09.789 --> 00:58:09.799 align:start position:0%
the committee yes representative miles
 
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
hi thank you chairman and thank you for
 
00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:14.039 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
um I understand you don't have a Excel
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet in front of you or anything
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
but can you tell the committee that's my
 
00:58:21.029 --> 00:58:21.039 align:start position:0%
first question is can you tell the
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
committee approximately how much a uh
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
glucose machine that you can get on
 
00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:28.599 align:start position:0%
Amazon or Target might be somewhere
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
around we have an analysis that I can
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
give you I'm just asking her a question
 
00:58:34.589 --> 00:58:34.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thanks thank you for the
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
question it's an excellent
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
question so there's more than one part
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
to the system just your average one get
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
in a box the um sensors are essentially
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
disposable they last for S to 14 days
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
depending on the product and then you
 
00:58:53.549 --> 00:58:53.559 align:start position:0%
need a new one they won't work after
 
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
that it just stops providing so like to
 
00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:58.950 align:start position:0%
that it just stops providing so like to
$50

00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
$50
 
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
is I'm going to defer fol more current
 
00:59:04.349 --> 00:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
in practice than me but it's more that
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
kind of detail we will get we'll get in
 
00:59:08.029 --> 00:59:08.039 align:start position:0%
that we will get you that information
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
and then just to the other part of that
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
is you need some kind of reader yeah
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
trying to get at is the significantly
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
increased cost of the sensors including
 
00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
like a Dexcom sensor they're not just
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
that those few little pieces those
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
include a transmitter a sensor the
 
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
strips are much more expensive and um my
 
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
concern is that as We Know Nothing is
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
for free and in the bill I noticed that
 
00:59:34.109 --> 00:59:34.119 align:start position:0%
it does state that the patient won't be
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
subject to deductible but they certainly
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
will be subject to higher co- shares and
 
00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
co-payments um so in the world of more
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
individualized medicine I'm concerned
 
00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
that this might be Overkill in making it
 
00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.349 --> 00:59:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
an A1C qualifier or some other
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
qualifier I'm not sure what the some
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
other means I'm trying to think
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
creatively on the spot um I think we
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
could mitigate that to some
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
extent I had some conversation earlier
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:23.240 align:start position:0%
deductible as I noted in my initial
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
remarks people with diabetes have
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
medical expenses is that are at least
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
two and a half times that of folks who
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
do not have
 
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
diabetes and it's chronic and ongoing
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's never going to end for
 
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.029 align:start position:0%
it's never going to end for
them

01:00:39.029 --> 01:00:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
if we change the language
 
01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
deductible it won't benefit anywhere
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
near as many people because some of
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
those folks will be paying out of pocket
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
and will simply not be able to access
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
it so to be quite Frank I'm I'm on the
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
fence about whether that's a good change
 
01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
to make in the bill I very much want to
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
help people with diabetes have access to
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
this technology that's so
 
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
valuable and I don't want to be foolish
 
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
enough to be stuck in a hard place and
 
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
then not help anybody yeah so more
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
conversation I guess yeah maybe some
 
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
hard guard rails around it perhaps okay
 
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
I I'm very willing to talk further thank
 
01:01:31.069 --> 01:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
else when when you get when you stop
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
pointing your fingers at each other
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
which who's going to
 
01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
speak do you think it would be helpful
 
01:01:47.029 --> 01:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
if um the bill was changed on from page
 
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
two um section three talked about
 
01:01:52.589 --> 01:01:52.599 align:start position:0%
subject to deductible from eliminating
 
01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
that that Clause that it not be subject
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
deductible thank you for your question
 
01:01:59.829 --> 01:01:59.839 align:start position:0%
can you just direct me to the line
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
you're on yeah I'm on page two it goes
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
from line 13 oh right okay
 
01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
um and this actually reminds me the bill
 
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
may look like it's redundant because
 
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
it's exactly the same for three sections
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
one for individual one for group and one
 
01:02:23.269 --> 01:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
for HMO uh Managed Care um so just to
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
clarify that I meant to say that earlier
 
01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:33.670 align:start position:0%
clarify that I meant to say that earlier
so

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
line I think my answer is going to be
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
whether to make it subject to deductible
 
01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:41.559 align:start position:0%
is a decision for the committee to make
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
based on the data that you receive from
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
my followup from what representative
 
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
spear offered and from the folks behind
 
01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.430 align:start position:0%
spear offered and from the folks behind
me

01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
um if the data on reflection of the
 
01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty details
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
looks like it's not an unmanageable ask
 
01:03:02.029 --> 01:03:02.039 align:start position:0%
for insurance companies to cover it
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
without deductible I would certainly
 
01:03:03.599 --> 01:03:04.789 align:start position:0%
without deductible I would certainly
prefer

01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
prefer
 
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
that but I would exempt those lines and
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
the parallel ones in the other parts of
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
the bill if need be to get some statute
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
of this sort
 
01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:18.309 align:start position:0%
of this sort
passed

01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:03:21.549 --> 01:03:21.559 align:start position:0%
you yes uh thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
question do you know of any states that
 
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
have uh this bill or similar type Bill
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh how many states and what are they
 
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that excellent question
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
and I knew the answer to that more
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
precisely when we brought this forward
 
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.829 align:start position:0%
precisely when we brought this forward
last

01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
time there are states that have this
 
01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
yes and I'm not going to trust myself to
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
accurately tell you who they are at this
 
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
moment I apologize but I will get that
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.349 --> 01:03:58.359 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you very
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
much thank you all and thank you for
 
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
your work and attention Okay the chair
 
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
we'll call on representative Jody n who
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
I assume is a co-sponsor of the
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
bill yes she
 
01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
is good morning good morning um thank
 
01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:16.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thanks to the committee
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
for giving me a little bit of your time
 
01:04:19.269 --> 01:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
and attention today I'm a co-sponsor in
 
01:04:21.549 --> 01:04:21.559 align:start position:0%
this bill very enthusiastically because
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh glucose monitoring equipment is
 
01:04:27.069 --> 01:04:27.079 align:start position:0%
frankly my mother's Lifeline um it uh
 
01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
she had a series of strokes and um you
 
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
know that changes a little bit in in how
 
01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
you function um how you are able to keep
 
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
track of things so my dad does as much
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
as he possibly can but um you know she
 
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
needs to test regularly to make sure
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
that um her levels are in line um if she
 
01:04:48.269 --> 01:04:48.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't test I get a call from the nurse
 
01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
because neither one of my parents like
 
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
to answer the phone um and uh I get a
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
call from the nurse and if the numbers
 
01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:55.480 align:start position:0%
are off too much she's in the hospital
 
01:04:58.510 --> 01:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
which she has been fairly often um so I
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
think you know we uh talk about dollars
 
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
and cents and we talk about you know um
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
a variety of things but really what I
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring to it was um the
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
personal because uh my mom means the
 
01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:11.720 align:start position:0%
world to me and it's equipment like this
 
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
that keeps her uh safe and healthy so
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your
 
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
01:05:32.589 --> 01:05:32.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone um please bear
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
with me I'm going to read part of my
 
01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
testimony because I really don't want to
 
01:05:40.589 --> 01:05:40.599 align:start position:0%
repeat everything that hope has already
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
said but I'd be happy to answer any of
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
your questions um I'm a certified
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
Diabetes Care and education specialist
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
similar to the uh credentials that hope
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
held until recently uh although I'm
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
currently retired I have maintained my
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
credentials because I feel very strongly
 
01:05:58.319 --> 01:05:59.510 align:start position:0%
credentials because I feel very strongly
about

01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
managing um the care of individuals with
 
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
diabetes and providing them with the
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
education that they need I have been a
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
certified Diabetes Care education
 
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
specialist since
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
1986 I have worked in inpatient settings
 
01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
I've worked in outpatient settings I
 
01:06:19.269 --> 01:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
have dealt with pediatric patients type
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
2 patients patients with gestational
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
diabetes uh patients in rehab settings
 
01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.510 align:start position:0%
diabetes uh patients in rehab settings
Etc

01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
um when I entered my career uh as a
 
01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:33.799 align:start position:0%
diabetes educator we did not have blood
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
glucose monitoring we actually had to
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
test urine to determine where the
 
01:06:42.309 --> 01:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
glucose was which was the only tool we
 
01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
had but it was highly
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
ineffective uh in establishing diabetes
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
control and then in the late
 
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
1980s um blood glucose monitoring became
 
01:06:55.359 --> 01:06:57.269 align:start position:0%
1980s um blood glucose monitoring became
uh

01:06:57.269 --> 01:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh became available to us and actually
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
there was a study that was done in which
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
ended in 1993 which is called the
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
diabetes control and complications trial
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
and that trial actually proved for
 
01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
individuals with type 1 diabetes who
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
kept their diabetes well controlled they
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
could reduce the risk of complications
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
dramatically there was a 60% drop in
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
diabetic retinopathy which is eye
 
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
disease which can cause individuals with
 
01:07:31.269 --> 01:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
diabetes to go blind there was a
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
significant drop in nerve damage caused
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
by diabetes which we call peripheral uh
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
peripheral neuropathy okay by 60% so
 
01:07:43.269 --> 01:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
people that had numbness and tingling in
 
01:07:46.029 --> 01:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
their feet for years and years and years
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
as they got their diabetes under better
 
01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
control that numbness and tingling went
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
away they had sensation in their feet
 
01:07:54.269 --> 01:07:54.279 align:start position:0%
that had been lost for a long period of
 
01:07:54.279 --> 01:07:56.109 align:start position:0%
that had been lost for a long period of
time

01:07:56.109 --> 01:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
if you can just imagine having sensation
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
return to your feet okay prior to um
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
blood glucose monitoring I had a
 
01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
particular gentleman who was a car
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
mechanic and um he went to work every
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
day okay he wanted to support his family
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
he got a nail which penetrated the his
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
boot okay and he did not feel the nail
 
01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
in his boot until he had been walking on
 
01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:29.799 align:start position:0%
it for a 24-hour period of time okay
 
01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:33.319 align:start position:0%
that's how bad the neuropathy was okay
 
01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately his leg could not be saved
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
and he became an amputee unfortunately
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
he had this experience twice he became a
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
double amputee because of a blister on
 
01:08:47.709 --> 01:08:47.719 align:start position:0%
his other leg I could go on and on and
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
tell you stories but that's one of the
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
reasons I am such an advocate of blood
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
glucose monitoring during the time that
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
it existed and still exists
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
but even more so an advocate for
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
individuals with diabetes to have access
 
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
to continuous blood glucose
 
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
monitoring all those hospitalizations
 
01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
and situations that I've described and
 
01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
we'll describe a little bit further are
 
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
extremely costly amputation is costly
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
heart disease is costly blindness is
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
costly okay it limits people ability to
 
01:09:29.309 --> 01:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
be able to be
 
01:09:29.319 --> 01:09:31.269 align:start position:0%
be able to be
productive

01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
productive
 
01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
um the technology has come a long way
 
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
and CGM or continuous blood blood
 
01:09:41.229 --> 01:09:41.239 align:start position:0%
glucose monitoring is part of that
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.829 --> 01:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-arts when we check blood
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
sugar it's a snapshot in time it tells
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
you at a moment in time where your blood
 
01:09:57.630 --> 01:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
sugar is at it does not tell you whether
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's going up or down whether it's
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
dangerously low and you're about ready
 
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
to crash your car because your blood
 
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
sugar is low okay or as hope gave the
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
example you got to throw your chainsaw
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
aside before you pass out from low blood
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
sugar I've encountered many individuals
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
who have crashed their cars because of
 
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
low blood sugar okay they were not able
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
continuous blood glucose monitoring
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
gives you a a picture quickly of where
 
01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
your blood sugar is at and quite frankly
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay it allows the person with diabetes
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
to be more productive I'm going to give
 
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
you the one example of one of my clients
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay who was a waitress okay when she
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
developed type 2
 
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
diabetes okay it was very difficult
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
during rush hour for her to be able to
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
check her blood glucose okay because
 
01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
what she would have needed to do because
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
of quote unquote the yuck factor of
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
blood particularly in a restaurant
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
setting if you can imagine okay she had
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
to go away someplace to test her blood
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
sugar which means that all those people
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
that are out there waiting to be served
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
and have their lunch okay had to wait a
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
little while longer well that was not
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
that really didn't make her boss very
 
01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
happy however if she had a continuous
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
blood glucose monitoring system she
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
could literally swipe her reader or her
 
01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.189 align:start position:0%
could literally swipe her reader or her
phone

01:11:26.189 --> 01:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
phone
 
01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
over her sensor and know exactly where
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
her blood sugar was at at that moment in
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
time and she would have an idea okay of
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
where her blood sugar was at and whether
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
she really need to excuse herself to get
 
01:11:42.189 --> 01:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
something to eat or whether she could
 
01:11:44.189 --> 01:11:44.199 align:start position:0%
work for the next half hour till things
 
01:11:44.199 --> 01:11:46.270 align:start position:0%
work for the next half hour till things
slowed

01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
slowed
 
01:11:49.629 --> 01:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
down the American Diabetes Association
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
in their 2025 standards of care
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
recommends CGM
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
for those with type 2 diabetes not only
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
those on insulin but those on other
 
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
medications for diabetes they have not
 
01:12:07.709 --> 01:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
recommended it for those that are
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
treated with diet alone and quite
 
01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
honestly there is technology available
 
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
that can be purchased by people with
 
01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:16.270 align:start position:0%
that can be purchased by people with
pre-diabetes

01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
pre-diabetes
 
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
okay um or those people that have type
 
01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
two diabetes one of them is called Stell
 
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
which is made by the same company that
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
makes uh that makes the Dexcom 7 okay
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
that Dexcom 7 is intended for
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
individuals that on medication for
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
diabetes but the problem the Stell one
 
01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
of the things that it does not do okay
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
and it isn't really necessary at this
 
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
point in time is to give the individual
 
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
with diabetes alerts whereas a
 
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
Dexcom uh seven okay or freestyle Libre
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
which are two of probably the one of of
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
the most popular
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh continuous blood monitoring
 
01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
systems can also give individuals alerts
 
01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
so we did not put that into the bill to
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
include individuals that treated with
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
diet alone we put into the bill
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
individuals that could be on other forms
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
of treatment because that's what the
 
01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
American Diabetes Association has
 
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
recommended quite frankly I know a
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
number of individuals okay that are
 
01:13:25.229 --> 01:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
currently using Okay continuous blood
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
glucose monitoring systems who have been
 
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
on insulin in the past okay they're now
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
off insulin because they have started a
 
01:13:36.189 --> 01:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
new category of drugs called gp1s okay
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
these are the drugs we see advertised on
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
TV OIC being one of them you know we
 
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
recognize that the some of these drugs
 
01:13:45.629 --> 01:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
are very costly and not everyone
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily has them okay however people
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
are fearful that if they come off of
 
01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
insulin they will no longer be able to
 
01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
have access to the continuous blood
 
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
glucose monitoring
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
system because they are now off insulin
 
01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
now what about the individual where the
 
01:14:05.709 --> 01:14:05.719 align:start position:0%
glp ones work okay for a short period of
 
01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
time and then they don't work
 
01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
hospitalization as an example they're
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
back on insulin again they really want
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
those that they really continue to need
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
to monitor their blood sugars so I hate
 
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
to do this but you're you're over your
 
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
five minutes obvious okay I apologize
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
can you kind of wrap it up I will wrap
 
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
it up I will wrap it up with uh
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
gestational diabetes okay
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh it has been described by hope very
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
well a person with gational diabetes
 
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
okay has um a high risk of giving birth
 
01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
to children that have a lot of problems
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
large babies babies that experience
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
hypoglycemia and by hypoglycemia I'm
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
talking about sometimes seizing after
 
01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
birth for up to 24 to 48 hours because
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
they can't get the baby's blood sugar up
 
01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
to a safe and normal range
 
01:14:58.990 --> 01:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
okay people with gational diabetes need
 
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
to test before they eat they need to
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
test two hours after each of their meals
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
that's very very difficult to do to say
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
nothing of the people that are extremely
 
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
afraid of needles and I have encountered
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
many individuals in my years in practice
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
that actually have passed out as we're
 
01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
trying to teach them to test their blood
 
01:15:19.149 --> 01:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
sugar and unfortunately have had bad
 
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
outcomes to their pregnancy because of
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
that I apologize for going over as you
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
can see I'm pretty passionate about what
 
01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
I say um but I would be welcome I would
 
01:15:32.669 --> 01:15:32.679 align:start position:0%
welcome any questions
 
01:15:35.629 --> 01:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
yeses whoever whoever gives permission
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you um thank you for sharing
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
the stories about the severe effects
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
that diabetes can have on people and
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's tragic um I'm wondering from your
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
experience or actually from anyone who
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
can answer this what is the current
 
01:15:54.189 --> 01:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
medical necessity criteria to get the
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
Dexcom mon The Continuous blood glucose
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
system I see I a lot of people have it
 
01:16:01.709 --> 01:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
so what is the current medical necessity
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
criteria for which they're able to get
 
01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
it currently okay the the current
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
medical necessity would be a diagnosis
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
of diabetes you cannot get the Dexcom 7
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
if you have pre-diabetes okay just as an
 
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
example you cannot get it if you're
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
controlled by diet alone so you could
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
have type two diabetes controlled by
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
diet alone or pre-diabetes you cannot
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
get it that's where individuals are now
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
going with this other system system
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
which is called Stell okay which it's an
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
over-the-counter product follow up for
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
the F the question um so as as as it
 
01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
stands we don't know if there's any
 
01:16:42.629 --> 01:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
numerical qualitative quantitative
 
01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
guidelines like the A1C or the glucose
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
the 90-day average you don't have any of
 
01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
that as a part of that medical necessity
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
currently it is uh it is it it is based
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
on diagnosis okay at this point it has
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
to be the doctor diagnosis the doctor
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
has had to make a diagnosis of diabetes
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay and you know these standards have
 
01:17:07.149 --> 01:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
just changed as far as these new
 
01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
medications are concerned so the studies
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
are not really there yet regarding the
 
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
outcomes of of what will happen um you
 
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
know we we know we know okay for those
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
of us that have worked in the field that
 
01:17:22.629 --> 01:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
it is extremely helpful to monitor where
 
01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
your blood sugars are at thank you thank
 
01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
you very
 
01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
much chair will call on Jason
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
a ziz who uh represents the insurance
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
department and as usual they will be
 
01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
legislation good morning Mr chair thank
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
you for the record Jason AIS director of
 
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
Health Economics New Hampshire insurance
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
department professor of physical
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
activity nutrition and health at T
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
University Unity school of medicine and
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
diabetic so I just wanted to make clear
 
01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
that I think the um representative miles
 
01:18:13.149 --> 01:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
question about the eligibility criteria
 
01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
is positive diagnosis of diabetes could
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
be either with the hemoglobin A1c 6.4%
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
or over an or orog glucose tolerance
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
test or fast in plasma glucose test that
 
01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
a positive for diabet abetes um and
 
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
currently on insulin therapy thank it's
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
not worthy that the two there was really
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
the two things yeah those two conditions
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
and so it's noteworthy that Medicare
 
01:18:40.830 --> 01:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
just in um April of 2024 reduced the
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
rigors of the insulin therapy
 
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
requirement from three um multiple daily
 
01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
injections to only one per day so
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
there's a a whole class of long acting
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
insulin bio or insulin secretor extended
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
release yeah okay so we wrote a fiscal
 
01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
note on this and I think we did one last
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
year um and the I think the fiscal
 
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
impact largely would be the same as in a
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and um you know I think
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
that's the extent of the testimony we're
 
01:19:14.110 --> 01:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill if the anyone here
 
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.629 --> 01:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
answer uh fiscal notes say zero do we
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
one to the extent that this is an
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
expanded um benefit requirement for
 
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
essential health benefits it would be
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
subject to the federal cost def frail
 
01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
right and so and to the extent that it
 
01:19:38.159 --> 01:19:39.550 align:start position:0%
right and so and to the extent that it
would

01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:39.560 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
increase um the frequency of
 
01:19:45.629 --> 01:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
prescription for cgms technology it
 
01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
would provide upward pressure on
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
premiums to the extent it's
 
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
indeterminable at this time oh yeah that
 
01:19:55.229 --> 01:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell me much but okay
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay the marginal cost is between $800
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
to $1,200 per unit per year so oh we are
 
01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
going to go to subcommittee so all these
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
issues will get fully vetted in the
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee okay but right now we're
 
01:20:09.629 --> 01:20:09.639 align:start position:0%
running short on time and I certainly
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to be here by
 
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
noon in case anybody has diabetes issues
 
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
much uh Sabrina Dunlap from Anthem who
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
is in opposition to the
 
01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:35.950 --> 01:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
Lindsay evidently Senate Health and
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
Human Services is meeting at the same
 
01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
time good morning everyone I'm Lindsay
 
01:20:43.709 --> 01:20:43.719 align:start position:0%
NATO um I'm an attorney from Orin Reno
 
01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
and we represent siga as mentioned
 
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
Sabrina asked me to pass along um her
 
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
apologies we are double booked this
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
morning and there's a bunch of Health
 
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
bills in Senate HHS right now as well um
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
so I wasn't planning on speaking so I'm
 
01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
going off the top of my head here from
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
last year but I will just point out a
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
couple concerns that um siga has and I
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
think some of the other carriers share
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
um with the bill and so just keeping in
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
mind generally the testimony we heard
 
01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:12.639 align:start position:0%
last year from uh and information from
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
the medical community is that the
 
01:21:17.229 --> 01:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
medical necessity for these devices for
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
type 2 diabetes is still up in the air
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
and so I think that's a concern right
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
we're really talking about whether these
 
01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
devices are medically necessary for type
 
01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
2 diabetes and I think that's where
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's concern that the bill is overly
 
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
broad um uh my understanding is that
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
plans generally cover them when
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
medically necessary for type 1 diabetes
 
01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
already um so in that sense I think this
 
01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
may be a bill in you know one of those
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
um it's a solution in search of a
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
problem in that sense um the other thing
 
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
I just would point out is anytime we
 
01:21:54.629 --> 01:21:54.639 align:start position:0%
have bills that say they're going to
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
limit um application to a deductible or
 
01:21:59.790 --> 01:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
co-pays or other cost sharing that's
 
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
concerning because those costs then
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
generally drive up costs quicker to the
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
overall plans um and so we do think this
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
would have um upward pressure on costs
 
01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:12.149 align:start position:0%
would have um upward pressure on costs
and

01:22:12.149 --> 01:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
premiums I would also note um I'm not
 
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
quite sure how logistically parts of the
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
bill would work um there's mentioned
 
01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
that to qualify for
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
coverage um people would need to stay on
 
01:22:27.629 --> 01:22:27.639 align:start position:0%
a continued course of treatment for 6 12
 
01:22:29.310 --> 01:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
or 18 months and so then the question
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
arises what happens if they don't do you
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
claw back coverage I don't think we
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
could or would do that but that's just a
 
01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
logistical problem I haven't quite seen
 
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
anything like that drafted in our
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
insurance laws
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
before um and just generally um you know
 
01:22:45.790 --> 01:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
mandates do cause upward pressure on
 
01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:47.639 align:start position:0%
premiums so we do always get concerned
 
01:22:49.149 --> 01:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
mandates I would also point out to the
 
01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
extent that the um Bill impacts the
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid plan certainly should talk to
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
HHS about what those costs would be
 
01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
there's no Medicaid okay sorry someone
 
01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned that
 
01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
earlier um and would also just just
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
qualify that would everybody understand
 
01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
this under the Affordable Care
 
01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
Act the um Marketplace which is
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
insurance for
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
individuals which some people might
 
01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
think is Medicare okay but it's
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
technically you know it is a separate
 
01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
little market that and I always say I
 
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
wish I was a fly on the wall when they
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
tried to figure this one out but what
 
01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
they did was for each state they put a
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
stake in the ground and they say any new
 
01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
health insurance mandate going
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
state yeah proceed and and that may have
 
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
been where the confusion is and I think
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
that's um noted in the Department's
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um so that's just something
 
01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
something to keep in mind um but happy
 
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
to try to answer any questions and if I
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
don't have the answers I will get them
 
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
in circle
 
01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
back okay representative
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
sharan U thanks for taking a question uh
 
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that uh very generically
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
that the premium will go up I mean
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's very generic you know uh outcome
 
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
but have you done any analysis as to how
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
much premium will go up if this is
 
01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
covered thank you for the question I
 
01:24:25.149 --> 01:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
last year um last year's Bill the
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
department did a pretty in-depth
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
analysis and I'm looking at rep spear
 
01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
who knows more about that um so that's
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
something we could certainly distribute
 
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
to the committee thank you yeah the
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will take that
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
up was you have the number off your head
 
01:24:41.229 --> 01:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
I have the numbers what was the number
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
the yes okay you have to understand how
 
01:24:47.310 --> 01:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
the number got derived okay Dr AIS gave
 
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
me the numbers for how much it costs for
 
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
each for these units AR range for those
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
units correct we said in the individual
 
01:25:00.270 --> 01:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
Market oh and he also gave me the upt
 
01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
uptake numbers for type one diabetes
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
assuming that the type one diabetes
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
uptake is the same as the type two which
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
26% it will cost based on those things
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
over the 20 uh 2,000 no 200,000 people
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
that are subscribers that are in the
 
01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
small Market the individual market and
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
the large large group Market covered by
 
01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
full insurance in the state that we have
 
01:25:31.629 --> 01:25:31.639 align:start position:0%
any control over comes out to about $23
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
a year $23 per year which is $2 a month
 
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
which is about $2 a month that's what
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
the cost is okay thank you any other
 
01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:41.950 align:start position:0%
the cost is okay thank you any other
questions

01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
for all right representative M thank you
 
01:25:47.790 --> 01:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
just to take it one step further has
 
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
there been any uh cost benefit analysis
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
in other words um the outcomes of people
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
they the health outcomes of people that
 
01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
are apparently on this monitoring device
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
are significantly better I understand
 
01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
but has anybody actually looked at that
 
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
or made projections I see a nod back
 
01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
there I'd like to hear about that thank
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
you for the question so I'm probably not
 
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
the person to answer that um but it
 
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
sounds like folks behind me probably
 
01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
could I think when you're when you're
 
01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
looking at mandates that's always a
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
question right is what is the cost
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis because there's a lot
 
01:26:25.109 --> 01:26:25.119 align:start position:0%
of mandates that in and themselves might
 
01:26:26.709 --> 01:26:26.719 align:start position:0%
seem like they cost just a little bit
 
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
but you have to remember they add up
 
01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
quickly and so we're looking at right
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
now in Senate HHS is a biomarker mandate
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of mandates every
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
single year that get considered and so
 
01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
when you're doing that cost benefit
 
01:26:41.550 --> 01:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
analysis it's important to look at not
 
01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
only uh this mandate but overall what
 
01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
are the cost drivers um in the market
 
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
but that's uh a good question represent
 
01:26:51.109 --> 01:26:51.119 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you for taking my
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
question you said in your testimony that
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
for type one one you is medically
 
01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
necessary is there ever a case where
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
type two is medically necessary um yes
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
the answer is if you've been di
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
diagnosed being a
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
diabetic A and B you're on insulin okay
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
and I I would also point out right so
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
anytime that you are um say you're type
 
01:27:18.510 --> 01:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
two but your doctor thinks you need this
 
01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
and they give you a prescription for it
 
01:27:22.590 --> 01:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
and um if you were to be denied there
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
are appeals processes
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
internally and then externally through
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
all the health insurance plans and so if
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
you are one of those unique scenarios
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
where it is medically necessary for you
 
01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
there's a process that you can go
 
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
through through your carrier to get that
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
approved okay represent spear the
 
01:27:42.669 --> 01:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
analysis that was done was done without
 
01:27:42.679 --> 01:27:43.629 align:start position:0%
analysis that was done was done without
a

01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:43.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
deductible so if the insurance company
 
01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
needs to put on a deductible depending
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
on what kind of plan you purchased that
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
number goes down so that's the maximum
 
01:27:55.149 --> 01:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
number right
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
okay represent
 
01:27:59.109 --> 01:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
sha um thank you again actually I just
 
01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:01.119 align:start position:0%
want to follow up uh maybe I'm not too
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
clear when you say medically necessary I
 
01:28:06.189 --> 01:28:06.199 align:start position:0%
heard two things either you're diagnosed
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
I mean you're diagnosed with the
 
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
diabetes is it and your on insulin or is
 
01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:12.639 align:start position:0%
it or your
 
01:28:15.709 --> 01:28:15.719 align:start position:0%
insulin right now I don't know answer to
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry and you've been diagnosed
 
01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:19.910 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry and you've been diagnosed
as

01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
diabetic and the The Physician is now
 
01:28:26.590 --> 01:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
giving you insulin and the idea was the
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
purpose of these test kits is to see how
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
the insulin is working because it can yo
 
01:28:34.109 --> 01:28:34.119 align:start position:0%
yo and the reason why I said is because
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
they were the reason why I said that as
 
01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:39.400 align:start position:0%
the question because I we don't we don't
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
want we'll take it up in subcommittee we
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
don't want we don't want is that is that
 
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
accurate or because I I don't think
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's accurate because uh I that's
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
something you can take up in the commit
 
01:28:51.870 --> 01:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
sub okay and I would just know right so
 
01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
um from the from a health plans
 
01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
perspective we're following National
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
guidelines for what's medically
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
necessary so um I think part of the
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill is that that
 
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
hasn't been decided yet in the type two
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
realm exactly among the medical
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
community okay I I I just thought the
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
first part is only necessary if you
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
diagnos diabetes is medically necessary
 
01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
that's what my understanding was so far
 
01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
right thank you okay thank you all right
 
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
uh chair will'll call on uh Nancy
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
Beerman and you didn't say how much time
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
you'll take but I hope you'll be brief
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
and not say anything that's already been
 
01:29:33.109 --> 01:29:33.119 align:start position:0%
said representative Aman knows I'm never
 
01:29:33.119 --> 01:29:34.870 align:start position:0%
said representative Aman knows I'm never
brief

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
brief
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
right uh Nancy Beerman um I'm
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
representing myself um just to also let
 
01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:41.119 align:start position:0%
you know I am a member of the New
 
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rare disease advisory Council
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
what what is that I'm sorry the New
 
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rare disease advisory ccil
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
disease okay but I'm not representing
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
them but I have to say it um I am a
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
mother of a type 1 diabetic um she was
 
01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
diagnosed in 2006 at the age of five um
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
very scary um until you meet other
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
parents when their children were
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
diagnosed as infants um she was able to
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
get a pump in 2010 which changed our
 
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
lives um but in order to get that pump I
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
had to fight the insurance companies um
 
01:30:18.990 --> 01:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
because I was taking too good of care of
 
01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
her her A1C was below the limit we had
 
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
to fight and fight the insurance
 
01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
companies um to get her eligible for a
 
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
pump because I was doing too well um
 
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
being doing too well means that I was
 
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
giving her finger sticks 8 to 10 almost
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes when she was sick up to 20
 
01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:43.239 align:start position:0%
times a day um on a normal day we would
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
be doing finger sticks before and after
 
01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
meals we'd also be doing and taking
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
turns with my husband and doing
 
01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
nighttime checks um which included um
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
before her going to bed another check at
 
01:30:58.629 --> 01:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock at night another check at 2
 
01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
am another check at 5:00 am. and then
 
01:31:04.189 --> 01:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
another check at 7 a.m. when uh we got
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
her ready for school so um
 
01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
for four to five years we were
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
constantly doing that until we got the
 
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
pump um the pump afforded us a little
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
bit more flexibility but we still were
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
doing the checks um until we could get
 
01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
the pump regulated um in about 2016 we
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
were able to get a continuous glucose
 
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
monitor and that changed our lives again
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
um because we could see where she was
 
01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
trending and see where her blood sugar
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
was going um for people that um T tried
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
to group all the diabetes together
 
01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
they're all different monsters in my
 
01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
viewpoint um but what you have to
 
01:31:46.430 --> 01:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
realize with A continuous glucose
 
01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
monitor it allows people to see what
 
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:51.400 align:start position:0%
foods react to them and how it affects
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
their blood sugar so what reacts and
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
makes your blood sugar go high doesn't
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
make me go High and um and so we um one
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
instance uh we had always gone to a
 
01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:06.280 align:start position:0%
certain pizza place and gotten pizza and
 
01:32:08.109 --> 01:32:08.119 align:start position:0%
um my daughter we had it dialed in one
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
slice of pizza is this many carbs um all
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
of a sudden it wasn't working anymore so
 
01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
I went up to the pizza uh guy and I said
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
hey did you change your recipe and he's
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
like yeah we did he's like is it tasting
 
01:32:21.629 --> 01:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
different I said no it's just affecting
 
01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
my daughter's blood sugar and he's like
 
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
really and I said yeah so I mean
 
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
something that simple that you don't
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
even know that a restaurant changed the
 
01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
recipe will change your um glucose and
 
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
cause issues um after she got uh her
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
continuous glucose uh monitor um the
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
first time we went back to
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
endocrinologist and we got the readout
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
her numbers were like perfectly in range
 
01:32:51.550 --> 01:32:51.560 align:start position:0%
um that readout is on her doctor's wall
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
um and in fact uh she still is in range
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
um when she had to move up from
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
pediatric uh doctors into adult doctors
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
um one of the first adult ones she saw
 
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
was the eye doctor and he is just
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely impressed with at her having
 
01:33:13.629 --> 01:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely no eye disease at all at her
 
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
age so and having you know she's spent
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
20 years with this disease anyone prior
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
to having these medical devices in 20
 
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
years would have other complic patients
 
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
so these two um devices now the current
 
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
CGM and um and she also got a a new pump
 
01:33:34.229 --> 01:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
they communicate with each other so we
 
01:33:35.709 --> 01:33:35.719 align:start position:0%
got that right before she went off to
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
college and that was just life-saving to
 
01:33:41.629 --> 01:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
me another great thing because I didn't
 
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
have to worry about her going low
 
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
overnight and her roommate not realizing
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
um she did have one low situation where
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
we had to call Public Safety um but that
 
01:33:54.109 --> 01:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
was because she was sick and um and her
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
roommate was home for the weekend uh so
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
but again they the more and more
 
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
technology advances keep her safer every
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
single day and I will say that we've
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
only had one hospital admission in 20
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
years so that's saving your insurance
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
company money um so that she hasn't had
 
01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
any chance of developing complications
 
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
or going into keto
 
01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
acidosis um and we're just just happy
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
with the technology that's out there and
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
so is she so Dexcom has been a lifesaver
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
and um they've also just with the G7
 
01:34:33.229 --> 01:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
it's updated and made it more usable and
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
friendly and less pieces to be involved
 
01:34:39.149 --> 01:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
which makes it easier for her to do it
 
01:34:42.629 --> 01:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
um but yeah and as far as the money goes
 
01:34:47.149 --> 01:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
um prior to yeah uh we had insurance
 
01:34:50.109 --> 01:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
that has a deductible it's $6,000 so
 
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
we've literally already paid for a
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
college education for her through her
 
01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
diabetes um diabetes is one of the most
 
01:34:59.070 --> 01:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
expensive diseases out there because of
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
the long-term uh necessity for it and um
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
so every year by February March we've
 
01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:08.679 align:start position:0%
paid her 6,000 deductible um insulin
 
01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
used to be $1,000 per month um then you
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
add on your pump supplies that's another
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
$1,000 a month and then you add on your
 
01:35:18.990 --> 01:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
CDM and that was also about $1,000 per
 
01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
month so you reach that $6,000 Mark
 
01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly and um um we would
 
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate and I'm sure every other
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
parent would appreciate having those
 
01:35:30.669 --> 01:35:30.679 align:start position:0%
numbers decreased I would also as she's
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
getting old enough to go off of our
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
insurance I would appreciate the cost of
 
01:35:36.990 --> 01:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
her uh chronic condition to be costing
 
01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
her less as I'm not sure what insurance
 
01:35:41.950 --> 01:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
she'll be able to get as an adult in in
 
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
the world and what insurance will cover
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
or not cover um as we find out more and
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
more kids between um going off their
 
01:35:52.830 --> 01:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
parents' insurance and getting a job
 
01:35:55.149 --> 01:35:55.159 align:start position:0%
that has good insurance for them and
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
covers more of it they are um dying
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford just even the
 
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
basic insulin because of the cost of it
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
um so please try to make everything less
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
cost it costs less for each of these
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
children especially in that time frame
 
01:36:16.990 --> 01:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I thought we passed a law that
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
limited to $100 a month yes more
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
recently okay so the numbers giving our
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
right but that's a concern as a parent
 
01:36:29.709 --> 01:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
that I lived with right until more
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
recently yes but in terms of people are
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
going to want to know what do it cost
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
now more recently yes those numbers have
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
gone down in fact the first time I got
 
01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
an insurance uh got a bill from for
 
01:36:42.109 --> 01:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
insulin and found out I I literally
 
01:36:43.629 --> 01:36:43.639 align:start position:0%
called him up and said did the insurance
 
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
company said did you push the wrong
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
button I mean how is this so less when
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
we were so used to paying so much each
 
01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
year and stuff I mean when we brought
 
01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
her home from the hospital we couldn't
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
bring her home without having all of the
 
01:36:56.830 --> 01:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
medical drugs and everything and the
 
01:36:58.750 --> 01:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
pharmacist looking at me he like can you
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
afford all this I mean that was a very
 
01:37:01.199 --> 01:37:02.390 align:start position:0%
afford all this I mean that was a very
Hefty

01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
Hefty
 
01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
Bell great thank you very much all right
 
01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh okay Andrew Hosmer representing
 
01:37:10.159 --> 01:37:13.629 align:start position:0%
uh okay Andrew Hosmer representing
Harvard

01:37:13.629 --> 01:37:13.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
brief thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:37:23.229 --> 01:37:23.239 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Andrew Hosmer I'm
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
here with representing Harvard Pilgrim
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
Healthcare which is New Hampshire's
 
01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
largest nonprofit Health insurer um
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate the work the
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative Damon's done in this bill
 
01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
and also the testimony from the previous
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh people who sat before you um I I do
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
want to let you know that Harvard
 
01:37:45.589 --> 01:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim uh is opposed to this bill um
 
01:37:49.149 --> 01:37:49.159 align:start position:0%
and just to touch on a couple of brief
 
01:37:51.550 --> 01:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
talking points here if I may Harvard
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim currently covers blue uh uh
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
blood glucose monitors and continuous
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
long-term glucose monitoring devices our
 
01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
coverage criteria are based on medical
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
necessity for those patients who need a
 
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
GL glucose monitor due to insulin
 
01:38:09.070 --> 01:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
utilization Andor frequency of blood
 
01:38:12.189 --> 01:38:12.199 align:start position:0%
glucose testing uh I also want to point
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
out too one of the issues that came up
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
was uh gestational diabetes uh Harvard
 
01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim considers continuous glucose
 
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
monitoring systems as reasonable and
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
medically necessary for Gest diabetes
 
01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:27.679 align:start position:0%
for the duration of a pregnancy um
 
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
naturally the uh the CGM must be
 
01:38:32.589 --> 01:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
prescribed by a professional provider
 
01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
with experience in treating gestational
 
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
diabetes uh this bill however would
 
01:38:39.589 --> 01:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
expand existing coverage and require
 
01:38:41.470 --> 01:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
coverage of glucose monitoring devices
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
and supplies to individuals with
 
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
diabetes that do not currently use
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
insulin therapy and for whom a
 
01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
continuous glucose monitor may not be
 
01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:51.470 align:start position:0%
continuous glucose monitor may not be
medically

01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
medically
 
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
necessary removal of prior authorization
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
requirements also limits Health Plan's
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
ability to ensure that our members are
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
receiving the right treatment at the
 
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
right time there have been concerns
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
already raised I won't repeat them about
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
the deductible and one of the concerns
 
01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
finally that we have in this bill as
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
well is that the bill requires specific
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
patient follow-up care that may be
 
01:39:16.109 --> 01:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
challenging for the carrier to uh make
 
01:39:18.030 --> 01:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
sure that the patient is complying with
 
01:39:20.189 --> 01:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
and then continue to authorize the the
 
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
coverage for the needed services and
 
01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:24.070 align:start position:0%
coverage for the needed services and
materials

01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
materials
 
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to take questions um
 
01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:33.589 --> 01:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
like represent shes yeah actually this
 
01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
is follow up the first question I was
 
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
trying to ask when you define is is the
 
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
definition of medical necessity is it
 
01:39:42.189 --> 01:39:42.199 align:start position:0%
different for insurance company versus
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
the medical providers because the reason
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
why I'm saying is that my wife she has
 
01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
diabetes and uh she's not an insulin
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
however her doctor did say that she
 
01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
should have the CGM of course the
 
01:39:56.589 --> 01:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
insurance not not paying for it so we
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
are paying from our pocket but the
 
01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
question but but the question is that
 
01:40:03.390 --> 01:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
the medical provider uh decided that
 
01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
this is medical necessary to have her
 
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
fian however the insurance company has a
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
different criteria to Define medical
 
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
necessity how are those two medical
 
01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
necessity criteria are different I I I
 
01:40:18.189 --> 01:40:18.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question and and
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
obviously I couldn't speak to you
 
01:40:21.629 --> 01:40:21.639 align:start position:0%
specifically to your wife's situation so
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
I can't shed any light on that what I
 
01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
will say is that Harvard uh Pilgrim uh
 
01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
considers long-term continuous glucose
 
01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
monitoring systems as reasonably and
 
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
medically necess necessary for diabetes
 
01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
when all of the protocols that they have
 
01:40:38.229 --> 01:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
worked to put in place which follows a
 
01:40:40.990 --> 01:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
National Standard are met um we do
 
01:40:43.149 --> 01:40:43.159 align:start position:0%
believe that is a consistency though
 
01:40:45.229 --> 01:40:45.239 align:start position:0%
between the provider and the carrier on
 
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
a number of issues um a number of
 
01:40:49.390 --> 01:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
diseases and number of diagnosis that
 
01:40:51.550 --> 01:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
may be met so the idea is to maintain
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
some consistency there um certainly we
 
01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
are the the carrier not the practitioner
 
01:40:58.750 --> 01:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
or the provider but we try to have an a
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
relationship with all of the pro
 
01:41:03.149 --> 01:41:03.159 align:start position:0%
providers that can deliver the best care
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
to those covered lives that are members
 
01:41:07.229 --> 01:41:07.239 align:start position:0%
of the Harvard Pilgrim Health
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
Plan just to follow quick question so so
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
just just follow on that so are you are
 
01:41:14.910 --> 01:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
you implying that the medical necessity
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
definition from the medical providers
 
01:41:19.629 --> 01:41:19.639 align:start position:0%
and the insurance company is is same at
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
this point I I can't speak to it
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
specifically I can say that you can
 
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
strive the certainly both providers and
 
01:41:28.030 --> 01:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
carriers will strive to have a
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
consistent um definition of medical
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
necessity based on the diagnosis in this
 
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
instance here I will say that the uh
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
Harvard Pilgrim is filing uh following
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me national standards uh for this
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
and believes that this is the best
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
determining this medical necessity
 
01:41:46.950 --> 01:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
delivers the best care for its patients
 
01:41:50.589 --> 01:41:50.599 align:start position:0%
that are covered thank you welcome okay
 
01:41:54.189 --> 01:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
represent Walts thank you Mr chairman
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question I
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
don't know for certain if you can answer
 
01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
it I was just wondering do you know what
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
year cgm's came to the marketplace I'm
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
sorry I can't answer that and if you
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
like though I'm happy to try and find
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
that information and provide it to the
 
01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:09.350 align:start position:0%
that information and provide it to the
committee

01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairperson members of the
 
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Brandon Gad I a
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
senior Assistant Attorney General chief
 
01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
of the consumer protection and anti
 
01:44:06.669 --> 01:44:06.679 align:start position:0%
trust Bureau at the New Hampshire
 
01:44:09.550 --> 01:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice um come before you
 
01:44:11.070 --> 01:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
I understand this bill is being retained
 
01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
so I will also try to be brief but I do
 
01:44:15.149 --> 01:44:15.159 align:start position:0%
think whatever amendments are submitted
 
01:44:17.790 --> 01:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
it is important to consider um my
 
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
testimony is not in for or against the
 
01:44:22.669 --> 01:44:22.679 align:start position:0%
merits of this bill but um expressing
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
concern about its placement under New
 
01:44:26.430 --> 01:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's consumer protection act the
 
01:44:28.270 --> 01:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
way this bill was drafted and the way
 
01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
many bills are drafted any violation
 
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
would be an unfair deceptive actor
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
practice in violation of 358 A2 um that
 
01:44:38.109 --> 01:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
has consequences that I think might not
 
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
be fully understood by the folks who
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
drafted this and possibly by the members
 
01:44:44.910 --> 01:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
of this committee and what I mean by
 
01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
that is New Hampshire's consumer
 
01:44:48.750 --> 01:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
protection act lists a number of
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
delineated violations so if you do this
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
thing it is considered a violation of
 
01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
the statute it also has a general
 
01:44:58.270 --> 01:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
prohibition that says any unfair or
 
01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
deceptive act or practice is also a
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
violation gives the Attorney General the
 
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
authority to bring criminal actions to
 
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
bring civil actions to issue subpoenas
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
to investigate um and the way that we
 
01:45:12.030 --> 01:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
figure out what is a general unfair or
 
01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
deceptive actor practice um courts have
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
issued a lot of guidance on this one of
 
01:45:18.589 --> 01:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
the critical factors though is they look
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
to the types of things that have been
 
01:45:23.589 --> 01:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
expressly listed in the statute
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
as unfair and deceptive Acts or practice
 
01:45:27.629 --> 01:45:27.639 align:start position:0%
and they ask the question is this new
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
thing of the same kind that is
 
01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
prohibited by the statute and most of
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
the things that are prohibited are
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
deceptive practices you know selling
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
something and making claims about it
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
that aren't true um Contracting for
 
01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
something that you have no ability to
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
provide or no reason to believe you can
 
01:45:46.350 --> 01:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
provide but if you add things that are
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
different than the things that are
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
currently listed it has the potential
 
01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
for the statute to expand to include
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
things that I don't think the
 
01:45:56.470 --> 01:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
legislature intended it to include and
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
in this case what is trying to be done
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
is to prohibit or limit the sale of
 
01:46:03.550 --> 01:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
certain things to Miners And there's an
 
01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
extensive history in this state and
 
01:46:06.589 --> 01:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
throughout the country of limiting what
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
can and can't be sold to miners but that
 
01:46:09.870 --> 01:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they're also
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
violations of the consumer protection
 
01:46:13.709 --> 01:46:13.719 align:start position:0%
act it's unlawful to sell cigarettes to
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
miners but it doesn't mean that it's an
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
unfair and deceptive actor practice it's
 
01:46:19.470 --> 01:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
unlawful to sell I believe lottery
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
tickets to miners alcohol to miners
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
various other things that doesn't mean
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
that doing so is an unfair deceptive
 
01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
actor practice there are other
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
consequences for those actions but by
 
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
making a violation of the consumer
 
01:46:33.870 --> 01:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
protection act simply a Prohibition
 
01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:35.639 align:start position:0%
against selling something to minors it
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
creates an argument that selling tobacco
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
products to miners is also an unfair and
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
deceptive actor practice selling
 
01:46:43.629 --> 01:46:43.639 align:start position:0%
fireworks to miners is also an unfair
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
deceptive actor practice selling weapons
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
to Miners and also an unfair and
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
deceptive actor practice and I don't
 
01:46:51.310 --> 01:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
think that that is anybody's intention
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
here so this if this is a type of
 
01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
prohibition that the legislature is
 
01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
interested in pursuing and there very
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
well may be Merit to it I think that
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
it's wrongfully placed under the
 
01:47:02.589 --> 01:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act in the
 
01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
legislature should think carefully about
 
01:47:07.790 --> 01:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
what type of enforcement or Consequences
 
01:47:10.350 --> 01:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
um are more appropriate for simply
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
something that prohibits the sale of
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
something to a minor and make it more in
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
line with those laws that already
 
01:47:17.950 --> 01:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
Express such prohibitions so happy to
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
take any questions at this time I

supplements weight loss um and muscle
 
01:48:53.790 --> 01:48:53.800 align:start position:0%
building um this as noted in the
 
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
Department's fiscal note um we're not
 
01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
able to estimate the precise fiscal
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
impact um because we can't determine the
 
01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
number of retail establishments that may
 
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
be impacted by this
 
01:49:09.070 --> 01:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
legislation the department only has
 
01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
information for retail establishments
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
that are required to be licensed by the
 
01:49:15.790 --> 01:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
department um under the food protection
 
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
section RSA 143a we licens about 4,900
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
food establishments approximately 11 00
 
01:49:24.669 --> 01:49:24.679 align:start position:0%
of those food establishments are
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
considered retail Food
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
Stores um this does not include the 15
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
self- inspecting cities and towns who
 
01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
license and inspect uh retail
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
establishments and this would not
 
01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
include retail establishments that have
 
01:49:40.149 --> 01:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
no food that require refrigeration for
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
safety and would not be required to be
 
01:49:45.070 --> 01:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
licensed by the department examples of
 
01:49:47.229 --> 01:49:47.239 align:start position:0%
these locations would be GNC's or
 
01:49:47.239 --> 01:49:49.870 align:start position:0%
these locations would be GNC's or
vitamin

01:49:49.870 --> 01:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
stores as written the department would
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
be respons for developing and providing
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
notice that clearly communicates the
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
health concerns of these
 
01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
products based on the understanding of
 
01:50:04.109 --> 01:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
the department we originally placed the
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact between $10,000 and
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
$100,000 per for fiscal year
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
2026 um and estimated that would be less
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
in future years um as long as the
 
01:50:20.109 --> 01:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
department wasn't required to create new
 
01:50:24.149 --> 01:50:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh posters for these counter locations
 
01:50:26.229 --> 01:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
after further review of the bill there
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
are concerns about the definition of
 
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.030 align:start position:0%
are concerns about the definition of
dietary

01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
dietary
 
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
supplement there is concerns that um
 
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
specifically dietary supplements for
 
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
weight loss or muscle building that are
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
intended to be included in this list
 
01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%
legislation could be interpreted in
 
01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
various ways and expand the list um that
 
01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:45.910 align:start position:0%
various ways and expand the list um that
impacts

01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
retailers the division Department would
 
01:50:49.629 --> 01:50:49.639 align:start position:0%
also like to note that we haven't
 
01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
researched any of these Health claims um
 
01:50:56.109 --> 01:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
identified and proposed in this
 
01:50:58.350 --> 01:50:58.360 align:start position:0%
legislation um and therefore could be
 
01:51:00.189 --> 01:51:00.199 align:start position:0%
broadly applied to supplements would
 
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
which not be helpful for consumers to
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
make an informed choice in order for the
 
01:51:08.750 --> 01:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
Department to develop uh informative and
 
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
useful messaging we' need to research
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
these Health claims and make sure
 
01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:15.709 align:start position:0%
these Health claims and make sure
that

01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
um the individual supplements would fall
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
under legislation would be accurately
 
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
represented in this um poster
 
01:51:26.109 --> 01:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
at this point we would not be able to
 
01:51:29.589 --> 01:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
define the cost of the department um
 
01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
with this uh further
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
research and I would just uh add that at
 
01:51:38.109 --> 01:51:38.119 align:start position:0%
this point the department isn't taking a
 
01:51:39.709 --> 01:51:39.719 align:start position:0%
position on the bill but we just wanted
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
to relay our concerns and we did share
 
01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
the same written testimony with uh the
 
01:51:46.109 --> 01:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor as
 
01:51:50.069 --> 01:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
well happy to take any questions so um
 
01:51:54.149 --> 01:51:54.159 align:start position:0%
so when I read this bill
 
01:51:56.589 --> 01:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
um again I have the curse of being
 
01:51:59.390 --> 01:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
around too long uh I immediately thought
 
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
about what happened with psea FEDS
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
because psea feds was an
 
01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:06.189 align:start position:0%
because psea feds was an
over-the-counter

01:52:06.189 --> 01:52:06.199 align:start position:0%
over-the-counter
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
drug and then all of a sudden we said
 
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
nope we're pulling it back and we're
 
01:52:13.069 --> 01:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
putting it behind the counter the
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
pharmacy counter and yes if you're under
 
01:52:19.870 --> 01:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
18 or 21 you can't buy it and and for
 
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
those of us who are over we got to show
 
01:52:23.550 --> 01:52:23.560 align:start position:0%
our driver's license and we can only get
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
so much was that statue are you guys
 
01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
involved was that purely the pH was that
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
a pharmaceutical statue that that okay I
 
01:52:36.069 --> 01:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
I don't think so we we are focused on
 
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
the food protection side right so yeah
 
01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm getting it is pharmace from the boss
 
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right our counterpart in the
 
01:52:46.270 --> 01:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
back we know each other
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
well okay so that answers that question
 
01:52:48.639 --> 01:52:49.669 align:start position:0%
well okay so that answers that question
all

01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much thank you
 
01:52:54.510 --> 01:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
thank you you okay I have one more card
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:03.709 --> 01:53:03.719 align:start position:0%
fry and he has left the room and he has
 
01:53:03.719 --> 01:53:04.990 align:start position:0%
fry and he has left the room and he has
no

01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:53:08.589 --> 01:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
position uh but it looks like he had a
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
question so
 
01:53:13.189 --> 01:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
we'll answer that question when we go to
 
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee okay so just to understand
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
the way we we do things here in Commerce
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
everything will go to a subcommittee and
 
01:53:21.709 --> 01:53:21.719 align:start position:0%
at that point in time we'll see where
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
you're at and and whether you know you
 
01:53:25.390 --> 01:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
have something to amend we can we can
 
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
get our arms around otherwise we will
 
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
just move to retain the bill okay and
 
01:53:32.669 --> 01:53:32.679 align:start position:0%
but it happens in sub committee and then
 
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
the full by the time we take it up with
 
01:53:36.750 --> 01:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
the full committee we've already have
 
01:53:39.629 --> 01:53:39.639 align:start position:0%
decided what was the best outcome so
 
01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
with that I will close the public
 
01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
hearing look at
 
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
that question on this he wasn't here he
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:51.310 align:start position:0%

we'll open up the public
 
03:24:36.830 --> 03:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 639 and here from
 
03:24:43.189 --> 03:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:46.590 --> 03:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
Ammon good afternoon
 
03:24:50.429 --> 03:24:50.439 align:start position:0%
good afternoon hello Commerce and Mr
 
03:24:52.870 --> 03:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
chair it's the best looking Committee in
 
03:24:55.590 --> 03:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
the whole state
 
03:24:57.590 --> 03:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
house uh so for the record my name is
 
03:25:00.189 --> 03:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
Keith Ammon I represent Hillsboro
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
District 42 that's New Boston Mount
 
03:25:05.150 --> 03:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
Vernon and line bro so thank you for
 
03:25:07.229 --> 03:25:07.239 align:start position:0%
your Indulgence this is my third and
 
03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
final blockchain related bill for the
 
03:25:12.630 --> 03:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
year and this one is uh it's called the
 
03:25:16.349 --> 03:25:16.359 align:start position:0%
blockchain basics law so what I thought
 
03:25:17.630 --> 03:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
thought I might do was just give you a
 
03:25:20.910 --> 03:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
high level overview on the bill the the
 
03:25:23.030 --> 03:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
ideas in this bill came from several
 
03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
places um one we had that uh commission
 
03:25:29.630 --> 03:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
that Governor sonunu uh issued had a
 
03:25:31.990 --> 03:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
report with recommendations and some of
 
03:25:33.950 --> 03:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
the recommendations that we haven't
 
03:25:35.870 --> 03:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
implemented are in this bill so sort of
 
03:25:39.389 --> 03:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
a clean up the remaining recommendations
 
03:25:41.830 --> 03:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
there's also language borrowed from
 
03:25:44.790 --> 03:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
model laws that are circulating in other
 
03:25:47.349 --> 03:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
states uh and then
 
03:25:50.070 --> 03:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
some some uh definitions that kind of
 
03:25:52.269 --> 03:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
knit it all
 
03:25:57.070 --> 03:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
together all right so uh one disclaimer
 
03:25:59.510 --> 03:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh I do own digital assets and I'm also
 
03:26:00.990 --> 03:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
the chair of the New Hampshire
 
03:26:02.830 --> 03:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
blockchain Council which is a new
 
03:26:05.550 --> 03:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
nonprofit volunteer
 
03:26:07.670 --> 03:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
organization so the overview I passed
 
03:26:09.870 --> 03:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
out written testimony for you can save
 
03:26:10.830 --> 03:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
it for
 
03:26:13.429 --> 03:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
later uh section one is the purpose and
 
03:26:15.950 --> 03:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
finding section section two is the short
 
03:26:18.630 --> 03:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
title which is the blockchain basics
 
03:26:21.070 --> 03:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
laws section three has some definitions
 
03:26:23.910 --> 03:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
in it that are related to
 
03:26:25.790 --> 03:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
blockchain and some of those might look
 
03:26:27.030 --> 03:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
familiar to you because they've they've
 
03:26:30.710 --> 03:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
been in other legislation some of them
 
03:26:34.630 --> 03:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
have so page three line 13 is where I'm
 
03:26:37.950 --> 03:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:42.830 --> 03:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
next yeah line 13 so I'm just going to
 
03:26:46.990 --> 03:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:49.349 --> 03:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
line 13 talks about holding and use of
 
03:26:52.469 --> 03:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
private digital currency so this this
 
03:26:54.950 --> 03:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
protects individuals rights to use
 
03:26:57.590 --> 03:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
digital assets for payments and self-
 
03:26:59.349 --> 03:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
custody which is an important concept
 
03:27:02.510 --> 03:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
self- custody ensuring freedom and
 
03:27:05.469 --> 03:27:05.479 align:start position:0%
reducing restrictions so that's what the
 
03:27:07.790 --> 03:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
holding and use of digital a private
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
digital currency that section it
 
03:27:12.910 --> 03:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
protects individual rights to hold and
 
03:27:14.910 --> 03:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
use digital
 
03:27:17.110 --> 03:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
assets uh
 
03:27:21.030 --> 03:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's line 13 line 21 same page
 
03:27:24.030 --> 03:27:24.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to run blockchain
 
03:27:26.469 --> 03:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
protected this safeguards infrastructure
 
03:27:29.229 --> 03:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
needed to run blockchain operations it
 
03:27:31.150 --> 03:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
allows home and Industrial mining
 
03:27:35.630 --> 03:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
operations to uh to exist and it
 
03:27:37.630 --> 03:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
prevents against discriminatory
 
03:27:40.429 --> 03:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
ordinances or electric
 
03:27:43.469 --> 03:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
rates so in we've seen in some states uh
 
03:27:46.189 --> 03:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
New York state in particular they wrote
 
03:27:48.349 --> 03:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
special laws that would discriminate
 
03:27:51.269 --> 03:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
against uh mining digital asset
 
03:27:55.229 --> 03:27:55.239 align:start position:0%
mining operations so we would Proclaim
 
03:27:58.750 --> 03:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:04.950 --> 03:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:07.710 --> 03:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
section and this is the right to private
 
03:28:09.990 --> 03:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
keys so this is another important
 
03:28:12.990 --> 03:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
concept for something called self-
 
03:28:16.590 --> 03:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
custody so basically your key
 
03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh represents your ownership over your
 
03:28:21.349 --> 03:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
digital assets and if someone else were
 
03:28:23.309 --> 03:28:23.319 align:start position:0%
to get that key they could they could
 
03:28:26.229 --> 03:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
steal them they could move them to a an
 
03:28:28.269 --> 03:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
account that you no longer
 
03:28:31.670 --> 03:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
control so this is basically a privacy
 
03:28:33.630 --> 03:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
aspect to the
 
03:28:36.910 --> 03:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
bill uh the next section is Page four
 
03:28:36.920 --> 03:28:39.469 align:start position:0%
bill uh the next section is Page four
line

03:28:39.469 --> 03:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:43.950 --> 03:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
19 and this this would recognize
 
03:28:43.960 --> 03:28:46.150 align:start position:0%
19 and this this would recognize
blockchainbased

03:28:46.150 --> 03:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
blockchainbased
 
03:28:49.990 --> 03:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
trusts they would be recognized and uh
 
03:28:51.269 --> 03:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
someone who's a little more expert on
 
03:28:53.389 --> 03:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
that will be speaking behind me but it
 
03:28:55.269 --> 03:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
basically uses precedent from existing
 
03:28:57.870 --> 03:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
trust laws that we have in New Hampshire
 
03:29:00.710 --> 03:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:03.389 --> 03:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
blockchain and let's
 
03:29:08.070 --> 03:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
see page four line 37 is the beginning
 
03:29:11.950 --> 03:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:14.309 --> 03:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
networks this is about reducing
 
03:29:16.630 --> 03:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
regulatory barriers
 
03:29:18.710 --> 03:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
and providing certainty for
 
03:29:21.269 --> 03:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
businesses and I won't dig into all the
 
03:29:24.189 --> 03:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
details there but basically a blockchain
 
03:29:27.389 --> 03:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
is a it's a decentralized network of
 
03:29:28.790 --> 03:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
computers and each computer is called a
 
03:29:31.590 --> 03:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
node and so for it to for it to work
 
03:29:33.710 --> 03:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
there has to be lots of nodes lots of
 
03:29:35.910 --> 03:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
places that all communicate with each
 
03:29:38.790 --> 03:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
other and that's the hardware
 
03:29:40.710 --> 03:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
operation so we're hearing a lot about
 
03:29:45.030 --> 03:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
AI requires big computers to operate um
 
03:29:47.510 --> 03:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
blockchain depending on the blockchain
 
03:29:50.189 --> 03:29:50.199 align:start position:0%
requires you know similar computation in
 
03:29:51.670 --> 03:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
order for it to
 
03:29:57.790 --> 03:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:02.670 --> 03:30:02.680 align:start position:0%
last so page six line 23 is just a
 
03:30:05.349 --> 03:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
standard cability clause and that just
 
03:30:07.670 --> 03:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
says if any section is struck down the
 
03:30:10.309 --> 03:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
the remaining sections will still
 
03:30:12.189 --> 03:30:12.199 align:start position:0%
exist and
 
03:30:18.990 --> 03:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:21.030 --> 03:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
would establish a blockchain dispute
 
03:30:23.229 --> 03:30:23.239 align:start position:0%
Docket in our judicial system and that
 
03:30:24.389 --> 03:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
is one of the
 
03:30:27.070 --> 03:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
major remaining recommendations from the
 
03:30:29.349 --> 03:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
governor's commission is
 
03:30:33.710 --> 03:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
that and so the analogy is Delaware has
 
03:30:36.110 --> 03:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's the home for to to register a
 
03:30:38.070 --> 03:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
corporation and part of the reason is
 
03:30:40.630 --> 03:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
because they have expertise in their
 
03:30:44.590 --> 03:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
court system to solve disputes resolve
 
03:30:48.670 --> 03:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
disputes around LLC law right and so if
 
03:30:52.030 --> 03:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to be uh home to digital
 
03:30:54.189 --> 03:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
asset industry in New Hampshire we want
 
03:30:56.830 --> 03:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
to have expertise in the judicial system
 
03:30:59.030 --> 03:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
around blockchain disputes there's a lot
 
03:31:00.990 --> 03:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
of if you just peruse the definition
 
03:31:03.590 --> 03:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
section you'll see that some expertise
 
03:31:03.600 --> 03:31:05.630 align:start position:0%
section you'll see that some expertise
is

03:31:05.630 --> 03:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:31:08.950 --> 03:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
required and finally effective dates uh
 
03:31:16.269 --> 03:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:20.269 --> 03:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
so the the blockchain dispute docket uh
 
03:31:24.590 --> 03:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
will go into effect January 1st 2026 so
 
03:31:26.950 --> 03:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
there's little less than a year to
 
03:31:28.150 --> 03:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
establish that depending on when this
 
03:31:30.670 --> 03:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
bill is signed and then the remainder is
 
03:31:32.790 --> 03:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
60 days after
 
03:31:35.469 --> 03:31:35.479 align:start position:0%
passage so that's my high Lev flyover
 
03:31:36.950 --> 03:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
there's lots of different sections in
 
03:31:39.030 --> 03:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
the bill but uh I'll stop there and
 
03:31:41.469 --> 03:31:41.479 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
03:31:43.950 --> 03:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you uh representative
 
03:31:43.960 --> 03:31:47.309 align:start position:0%
questions thank you uh representative
spear

03:31:47.309 --> 03:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:54.510 --> 03:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:59.150 --> 03:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
me last year we um reviewed and and
 
03:32:01.229 --> 03:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
eventually developed laws around Dows
 
03:32:02.389 --> 03:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
and this year we're going to give it a
 
03:32:05.750 --> 03:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
shot with uh tokenized uh real world
 
03:32:08.950 --> 03:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
assets and stable coins good job
 
03:32:08.960 --> 03:32:10.309 align:start position:0%
assets and stable coins good job
everything's

03:32:10.309 --> 03:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
everything's
 
03:32:16.150 --> 03:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
great this bill has sections in it that
 
03:32:18.750 --> 03:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
limits the ability of the
 
03:32:23.309 --> 03:32:23.319 align:start position:0%
state to legislate certain limitations
 
03:32:23.319 --> 03:32:25.070 align:start position:0%
state to legislate certain limitations
on

03:32:25.070 --> 03:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:32:28.229 --> 03:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
blockchains in for instance in
 
03:32:31.189 --> 03:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
environmental kind of stuff now the fact
 
03:32:33.070 --> 03:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
that a blockchain is is run on a on
 
03:32:34.389 --> 03:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
three computers isn't going to bother
 
03:32:36.550 --> 03:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
anybody but when it starts getting very
 
03:32:39.510 --> 03:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
large it can impact our electrical grid
 
03:32:41.030 --> 03:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
which isn't the most stable in the
 
03:32:43.670 --> 03:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
country it can impact our water supply
 
03:32:45.990 --> 03:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
it can impact when it gets really big we
 
03:32:47.710 --> 03:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
can be facing what they're facing in
 
03:32:51.150 --> 03:32:51.160 align:start position:0%
Texas which is endless lawsuits over
 
03:32:54.030 --> 03:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
noise water electrical grid and their
 
03:32:57.229 --> 03:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:00.630 --> 03:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
ours so my feeling is and and I want to
 
03:33:03.510 --> 03:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
get your your opinion on this why aren't
 
03:33:05.950 --> 03:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
we doing an investigation before we're
 
03:33:07.790 --> 03:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
just throwing a bunch of laws out there
 
03:33:10.030 --> 03:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
to see what the impact is on some some
 
03:33:11.950 --> 03:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
of the stuff is no problem but some of
 
03:33:14.590 --> 03:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
the stuff we need to we need to look at
 
03:33:14.600 --> 03:33:16.269 align:start position:0%
the stuff we need to we need to look at
this

03:33:16.269 --> 03:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:33:19.269 --> 03:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
so okay um I think I'm asking a question
 
03:33:20.950 --> 03:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
yeah would you believe so I would
 
03:33:23.790 --> 03:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
believe that um so the the idea in this
 
03:33:25.150 --> 03:33:25.160 align:start position:0%
bill is that there wouldn't be
 
03:33:28.590 --> 03:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
discriminatory action so like if if uh
 
03:33:31.429 --> 03:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
the you know the the the rules around
 
03:33:33.510 --> 03:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
connecting a large consumer to the
 
03:33:36.189 --> 03:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
electric grid would apply equally to
 
03:33:38.630 --> 03:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
blockchain companies as other companies
 
03:33:41.070 --> 03:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
so the idea is that it it wouldn't it
 
03:33:43.189 --> 03:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have no rules it just wouldn't
 
03:33:45.349 --> 03:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
have special rules that Target that
 
03:33:47.110 --> 03:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
specific industry and what it would do
 
03:33:48.830 --> 03:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
is give confidence to the industry that
 
03:33:50.990 --> 03:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
we're not going to discriminate against
 
03:33:52.750 --> 03:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
them because it's happened in other
 
03:33:56.590 --> 03:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
states can I follow follow up you made
 
03:33:58.070 --> 03:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
this is a big conversation about energy
 
03:34:02.830 --> 03:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:05.389 --> 03:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
uh we've been legislating and and
 
03:34:07.389 --> 03:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
dealing with those items that I talked
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
about before and now all of a sudden
 
03:34:10.950 --> 03:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
we're getting into things that can be
 
03:34:13.150 --> 03:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency could be anything and we
 
03:34:14.790 --> 03:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
haven't built any legislative stuff
 
03:34:17.150 --> 03:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
around any of that and we haven't even
 
03:34:19.150 --> 03:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
decided if we want any of that in the
 
03:34:20.990 --> 03:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
state I'm not saying we wouldn't but you
 
03:34:23.389 --> 03:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
know we haven't made those decisions yet
 
03:34:24.630 --> 03:34:24.640 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden we're giving
 
03:34:27.630 --> 03:34:27.640 align:start position:0%
everybody cart blanch knock yourself out
 
03:34:29.389 --> 03:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
so what's cart blanch about the bill
 
03:34:31.710 --> 03:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
that's what I want to
 
03:34:33.990 --> 03:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
understand I don't think that the city
 
03:34:36.870 --> 03:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
of Nashua has ever come up with the
 
03:34:39.389 --> 03:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
noise requirements in a neighborhood
 
03:34:41.469 --> 03:34:41.479 align:start position:0%
before they never they never looked at
 
03:34:45.110 --> 03:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
that I don't think we've ever looked at
 
03:34:47.309 --> 03:34:47.319 align:start position:0%
we we we have bills around that talk
 
03:34:49.469 --> 03:34:49.479 align:start position:0%
about micro grids that I see people
 
03:34:51.710 --> 03:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
being evaluated yeah maybe what we want
 
03:34:54.229 --> 03:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
to say is if they get a certain size get
 
03:34:57.469 --> 03:34:57.479 align:start position:0%
your own micro grid maybe we want to say
 
03:34:59.269 --> 03:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
no you can't take the whole
 
03:35:02.349 --> 03:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
grid like they do in other states and
 
03:35:04.189 --> 03:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
and face a bunch of lawsuits there's
 
03:35:06.429 --> 03:35:06.439 align:start position:0%
some evaluation that needs to go on here
 
03:35:06.439 --> 03:35:08.710 align:start position:0%
some evaluation that needs to go on here
not

03:35:08.710 --> 03:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:35:12.790 --> 03:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
just sign up for stuff I so that's my
 
03:35:14.670 --> 03:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
this this is anti-discriminatory
 
03:35:17.349 --> 03:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
language it's not enabling it's not a
 
03:35:19.950 --> 03:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
special carve out it's it's to protect
 
03:35:22.189 --> 03:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
from it being targeted by people who
 
03:35:24.630 --> 03:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
don't understand the energy consumption
 
03:35:26.189 --> 03:35:26.199 align:start position:0%
issue because that's a very
 
03:35:29.630 --> 03:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive issue and in Texas
 
03:35:32.150 --> 03:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
there's the large mining operations and
 
03:35:34.510 --> 03:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
they shut down when the demand on the
 
03:35:37.710 --> 03:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
grid goes up so it's called a large
 
03:35:37.720 --> 03:35:41.309 align:start position:0%
grid goes up so it's called a large
flexible

03:35:41.309 --> 03:35:41.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:43.750 --> 03:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
load I saw that remember what our
 
03:35:47.189 --> 03:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
maximum is is one Meg right so our our
 
03:35:49.870 --> 03:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
Energy prices in New Hampshire are
 
03:35:52.349 --> 03:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
probably too high to have a lot of
 
03:35:54.429 --> 03:35:54.439 align:start position:0%
mining here because it goes to where the
 
03:35:56.630 --> 03:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
energy is cheap and in Texas they have a
 
03:35:59.429 --> 03:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
lot of fossil fuels and big wind farms
 
03:36:01.349 --> 03:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't see that as being a
 
03:36:03.670 --> 03:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
major issue in New Hampshire but it it
 
03:36:05.429 --> 03:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
would send the signal that we're a
 
03:36:07.510 --> 03:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
friendly State we're not going to crack
 
03:36:10.349 --> 03:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
down because uh we heard we heard a you
 
03:36:11.389 --> 03:36:11.399 align:start position:0%
know a
 
03:36:14.070 --> 03:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
news article that was negative a lot of
 
03:36:15.790 --> 03:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
the information we get in the media is
 
03:36:16.990 --> 03:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
03:36:21.309 --> 03:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:21.319 --> 03:36:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:36:23.030 --> 03:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:36:26.750 --> 03:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
okay point taken representative
 
03:36:29.590 --> 03:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you and thank you for coming
 
03:36:32.870 --> 03:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
to testify this afternoon um I have a
 
03:36:34.910 --> 03:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
number of questions about this bill and
 
03:36:36.349 --> 03:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try and take them a couple
 
03:36:38.670 --> 03:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
at a time so I don't take up the whole
 
03:36:40.950 --> 03:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
hearing um and I'm afraid I have to
 
03:36:45.830 --> 03:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
start with the definitions um on um page
 
03:36:51.110 --> 03:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
three um lines 4 through uh 10 cover
 
03:36:55.670 --> 03:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
smart contracts yes and um on lines nine
 
03:36:55.680 --> 03:36:56.710 align:start position:0%
smart contracts yes and um on lines nine
and

03:36:56.710 --> 03:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:37:00.910 --> 03:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
10 it says that a smart contract um is
 
03:37:03.790 --> 03:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
the creation of irrevocable digital
 
03:37:06.309 --> 03:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
arrangements and then says that a smart
 
03:37:09.309 --> 03:37:09.319 align:start position:0%
contract need not meet the common law
 
03:37:12.950 --> 03:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
requirements of a legal contract yeah if
 
03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
it creates irrevocable Arrangements it
 
03:37:18.830 --> 03:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
why doesn't it need to satisfy the
 
03:37:20.269 --> 03:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
requirements of a
 
03:37:22.469 --> 03:37:22.479 align:start position:0%
contract that's a very good question and
 
03:37:24.269 --> 03:37:24.279 align:start position:0%
fortunately I think there are at least
 
03:37:26.229 --> 03:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
two attorneys behind me that will
 
03:37:27.309 --> 03:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
probably be able to answer that better
 
03:37:29.790 --> 03:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
than I can but uh the technical point is
 
03:37:32.710 --> 03:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
that a smart contract is irrevocable by
 
03:37:35.950 --> 03:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
Nature it cannot be revoked and that's
 
03:37:38.349 --> 03:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
one of the it's it's a property of
 
03:37:40.950 --> 03:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
immutability that is uh sort of central
 
03:37:44.189 --> 03:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
to blockchain Theory so no matter what
 
03:37:47.910 --> 03:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
we we do we we can't possibly cancel a
 
03:37:49.469 --> 03:37:49.479 align:start position:0%
smart contract on the blockchain it's
 
03:37:53.630 --> 03:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
it's just not it's designed to resist
 
03:37:55.830 --> 03:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
change so that's that's the technical
 
03:37:58.110 --> 03:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
reason now why it's not considered a
 
03:38:02.309 --> 03:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
legal contract I uh I think if you drew
 
03:38:04.550 --> 03:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
a VIN diagram of what a legal contract
 
03:38:06.349 --> 03:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
can do and what a smart contract can do
 
03:38:10.550 --> 03:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
there might be some overlap um but a
 
03:38:12.830 --> 03:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
smart contract isn't an analogous to a
 
03:38:16.550 --> 03:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
legal contract that's my Layman's
 
03:38:19.189 --> 03:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
heard a question you may inquire thank
 
03:38:19.199 --> 03:38:20.830 align:start position:0%
heard a question you may inquire thank
you

03:38:20.830 --> 03:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:38:24.990 --> 03:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
um okay uh lines 11 and 12 on page three
 
03:38:28.150 --> 03:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
it says staking means using a node to
 
03:38:30.790 --> 03:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
lock digital Assets in order to operate
 
03:38:33.389 --> 03:38:33.399 align:start position:0%
the consensus mechanism of a blockchain
 
03:38:35.550 --> 03:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
protocol now I understand that a node is
 
03:38:38.309 --> 03:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
a computer right but locking digital
 
03:38:41.030 --> 03:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
Assets in order to operate the consensus
 
03:38:43.750 --> 03:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism of a blockchain protocol could
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
you tell us what that means please yeah
 
03:38:47.150 --> 03:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
that's a great great question uh so
 
03:38:48.269 --> 03:38:48.279 align:start position:0%
representative Spears talked about
 
03:38:53.189 --> 03:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
energy consumption on blockchain so the
 
03:38:54.510 --> 03:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
central idea is something called a
 
03:38:57.710 --> 03:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
consensus mechanism consensus mechanism
 
03:39:00.150 --> 03:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
and what that mechanism does it's an
 
03:39:04.710 --> 03:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
algorithm uh each node operator runs a
 
03:39:06.830 --> 03:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
copy of the entire blockchain this is
 
03:39:08.469 --> 03:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
the way it works on most blockchains
 
03:39:10.229 --> 03:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
they each have a copy right and so
 
03:39:12.710 --> 03:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
they're all trying to update their
 
03:39:15.950 --> 03:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
information simultaneously so consensus
 
03:39:17.630 --> 03:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
mechanism allows them to come to
 
03:39:20.150 --> 03:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
agreement on what the next block is
 
03:39:21.349 --> 03:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
going to be in the blockchain that's
 
03:39:25.229 --> 03:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
what a consensus mechanism is so Bitcoin
 
03:39:26.590 --> 03:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
and others like it use something called
 
03:39:30.229 --> 03:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
proof of work proof of work and that's
 
03:39:32.830 --> 03:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
computers crunching trying to solve
 
03:39:35.189 --> 03:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
basically a big riddle and that's how
 
03:39:37.309 --> 03:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
and the first one to come to that answer
 
03:39:39.750 --> 03:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
gets the block okay staking is a is a
 
03:39:42.309 --> 03:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
different kind of consensus mechanism
 
03:39:44.309 --> 03:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
it's called proof of stake and how proof
 
03:39:45.910 --> 03:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
of stake works
 
03:39:47.429 --> 03:39:47.439 align:start position:0%
and why people like it that are
 
03:39:50.110 --> 03:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
concerned about energy consumption is it
 
03:39:52.830 --> 03:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't require as much energy as proof
 
03:39:55.630 --> 03:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
of work does it's sort of like an uh an
 
03:39:58.429 --> 03:39:58.439 align:start position:0%
environmental upgrade on a consensus
 
03:40:01.510 --> 03:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism so how staking works is let's
 
03:40:03.229 --> 03:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
say you have a
 
03:40:03.239 --> 03:40:05.229 align:start position:0%
say you have a
100

03:40:05.229 --> 03:40:05.239 align:start position:0%
100
 
03:40:07.429 --> 03:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
so the foundational idea is that
 
03:40:09.150 --> 03:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
blockchains cannot work without
 
03:40:11.150 --> 03:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
incentives and the incentives are the
 
03:40:13.110 --> 03:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
native token to that blockchain that's
 
03:40:16.630 --> 03:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
the incentive that's the thing that has
 
03:40:21.070 --> 03:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
everyone cooperating to to maintain the
 
03:40:25.269 --> 03:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
system in proof of stake the node has
 
03:40:27.469 --> 03:40:27.479 align:start position:0%
basically a treasury on it it's not
 
03:40:28.670 --> 03:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
really called a treasury but you can
 
03:40:31.389 --> 03:40:31.399 align:start position:0%
think of it like a treasury and people
 
03:40:33.150 --> 03:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
take their assets they put it on that
 
03:40:34.710 --> 03:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
node that's called
 
03:40:37.710 --> 03:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
staking if that node becomes a bad actor
 
03:40:41.349 --> 03:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
in the consensus if it tries to steal
 
03:40:43.469 --> 03:40:43.479 align:start position:0%
defraud the the rest of the network
 
03:40:45.870 --> 03:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
punishes that node and then it's called
 
03:40:50.030 --> 03:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
a slashing event all of that stake you
 
03:40:51.309 --> 03:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
know either gets destroyed or
 
03:40:52.590 --> 03:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
distributed back to the rest of the
 
03:40:55.030 --> 03:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
system that node gets punished for being
 
03:40:59.990 --> 03:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
a bad actor so in to to incentivize
 
03:41:03.349 --> 03:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
staking when the node participates in
 
03:41:06.750 --> 03:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
accurate blocks a little bit of of those
 
03:41:09.309 --> 03:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
units get rewarded to the stakers
 
03:41:10.590 --> 03:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
usually in proportion to how much they
 
03:41:12.269 --> 03:41:12.279 align:start position:0%
have stake it's sort of like interest on
 
03:41:14.469 --> 03:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
a bank account so as long as that node
 
03:41:16.590 --> 03:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
is operating
 
03:41:18.750 --> 03:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
accurately and honestly the people who
 
03:41:20.510 --> 03:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
stake their assets on that node will get
 
03:41:22.309 --> 03:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
a reward you know they're risking
 
03:41:24.510 --> 03:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
something and they'll get a reward for
 
03:41:26.990 --> 03:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
that node behaving accurately now that
 
03:41:30.429 --> 03:41:30.439 align:start position:0%
sounds like a silly thing there are
 
03:41:33.550 --> 03:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
large companies being established right
 
03:41:36.910 --> 03:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
now that that's all they do is they they
 
03:41:39.149 --> 03:41:39.159 align:start position:0%
take your asset and they figure out
 
03:41:41.429 --> 03:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
where it's best to stake so that you get
 
03:41:43.830 --> 03:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
the the best return and the safest
 
03:41:45.510 --> 03:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
return on your funds that that's being
 
03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
done at the institutional level so
 
03:41:48.640 --> 03:41:49.630 align:start position:0%
done at the institutional level so
that's

03:41:49.630 --> 03:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:41:55.469 --> 03:41:55.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
03:42:01.030 --> 03:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
teria yeah thank you for taking a
 
03:42:03.469 --> 03:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
question uh well the question is mostly
 
03:42:06.030 --> 03:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
from my own understanding as I
 
03:42:08.110 --> 03:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
understand that when you use the word
 
03:42:10.550 --> 03:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know blockchain or uh digital asset
 
03:42:12.670 --> 03:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
mining or Bitcoin mining yeah it
 
03:42:16.030 --> 03:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
basically is running some algorithm
 
03:42:19.389 --> 03:42:19.399 align:start position:0%
on super high computers high speed and
 
03:42:21.950 --> 03:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
trying to you know use the algorithm
 
03:42:24.870 --> 03:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's not really it's not really uh you
 
03:42:28.149 --> 03:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
know physical mining or something so my
 
03:42:30.830 --> 03:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
my the question is that and I couldn't
 
03:42:32.710 --> 03:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
understand when you use the on page
 
03:42:35.510 --> 03:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
three from line 22 to line 25 you're
 
03:42:39.309 --> 03:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
talking about uh noise pollution or lot
 
03:42:43.149 --> 03:42:43.159 align:start position:0%
of noise coming in that process can you
 
03:42:45.309 --> 03:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
explain a little better like uh how when
 
03:42:46.910 --> 03:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
you were talking about you
 
03:42:50.870 --> 03:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
know algorithm and using supercomputers
 
03:42:53.469 --> 03:42:53.479 align:start position:0%
to you know uh get it as fast as
 
03:42:55.590 --> 03:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
possible where is the noise part coming
 
03:42:57.030 --> 03:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
up that part I could understand yeah
 
03:43:00.590 --> 03:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
that's a good question um
 
03:43:03.229 --> 03:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
so so I'll take the home part first
 
03:43:05.309 --> 03:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
right so it used to be you could mine
 
03:43:06.550 --> 03:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin on a
 
03:43:08.910 --> 03:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
laptop but there's something called the
 
03:43:10.349 --> 03:43:10.359 align:start position:0%
difficulty adjustment where the more
 
03:43:12.630 --> 03:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
computers crunch it the harder it gets
 
03:43:16.269 --> 03:43:16.279 align:start position:0%
and the so there was an arms race in uh
 
03:43:18.590 --> 03:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin where now to mine it you need a
 
03:43:21.189 --> 03:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
special chip it's called an Asic it's a
 
03:43:24.469 --> 03:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
specialized chip and all it does is as
 
03:43:26.550 --> 03:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
efficiently as possible crunches the
 
03:43:29.149 --> 03:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin mining algorithm and that's
 
03:43:31.110 --> 03:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
probably outs we can buy one on on
 
03:43:34.269 --> 03:43:34.279 align:start position:0%
online but it's a very small part of the
 
03:43:36.189 --> 03:43:36.199 align:start position:0%
whole network but there are there are
 
03:43:38.309 --> 03:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
other assets where you could still mine
 
03:43:40.870 --> 03:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
it on a laptop um where the where the
 
03:43:44.469 --> 03:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
noise comes from is a computer needs
 
03:43:46.309 --> 03:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
energy to think right and one of the
 
03:43:49.790 --> 03:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
byproducts is heat and so to dissipate
 
03:43:51.870 --> 03:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
the heat so you don't burn up the chip
 
03:43:55.189 --> 03:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
you need usually a fan and that's that's
 
03:43:58.510 --> 03:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
generally the noisiest uh way to cool
 
03:43:59.750 --> 03:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know if we're talking about a large
 
03:44:02.189 --> 03:44:02.199 align:start position:0%
scale mining operation but there's
 
03:44:03.870 --> 03:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
improvements on that even where there's
 
03:44:06.910 --> 03:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
liquid cooling so they have liquid uh
 
03:44:10.269 --> 03:44:10.279 align:start position:0%
flows over the you know some fins and
 
03:44:11.550 --> 03:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
dissipates the Heat and that's much
 
03:44:12.990 --> 03:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
quieter and that's where a lot of the M
 
03:44:14.750 --> 03:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
the big mining operations are going okay
 
03:44:17.110 --> 03:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
so okay so my understand so usually
 
03:44:19.630 --> 03:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
usually the computers they always have
 
03:44:22.070 --> 03:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
fan technology I know about that to pull
 
03:44:23.189 --> 03:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
it off just like your computer at home
 
03:44:24.510 --> 03:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
and need's a fan yeah so here you're
 
03:44:26.229 --> 03:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
saying it requires a big fan or big
 
03:44:28.469 --> 03:44:28.479 align:start position:0%
something that to cool it off and that
 
03:44:30.149 --> 03:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
that is the noise that's where most of
 
03:44:31.630 --> 03:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
the noise comes from thank you in large
 
03:44:33.269 --> 03:44:33.279 align:start position:0%
scale mining operations this bill would
 
03:44:35.790 --> 03:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
not exempt them from from noise
 
03:44:37.469 --> 03:44:37.479 align:start position:0%
ordinances they would still have to
 
03:44:39.870 --> 03:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
comply what it does is it prevents noise
 
03:44:42.110 --> 03:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
ordinances from being weaponized against
 
03:44:43.870 --> 03:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
just that particular industry which we
 
03:44:45.910 --> 03:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
see in some other states so
 
03:44:49.550 --> 03:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:54.189 --> 03:44:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:55.950 --> 03:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
burrow thank you and thank you for
 
03:44:58.110 --> 03:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question and I think we're all
 
03:44:59.870 --> 03:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
trying to learn this stuff as quickly as
 
03:45:01.590 --> 03:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
we can yeah so you're talking about a
 
03:45:04.349 --> 03:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
bad actor I think on the Node is it so
 
03:45:05.790 --> 03:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
how how do you determine that somebody's
 
03:45:07.830 --> 03:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
a bad actor and and who makes that
 
03:45:12.070 --> 03:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
decision and to distribute those assets
 
03:45:17.070 --> 03:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:18.710 --> 03:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
so so instead of thinking in terms of
 
03:45:20.429 --> 03:45:20.439 align:start position:0%
like a company where you have like
 
03:45:22.070 --> 03:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
people in charge and making decisions
 
03:45:24.229 --> 03:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
you have to think more in terms of a
 
03:45:26.750 --> 03:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
protocol so a protocol is like your
 
03:45:29.510 --> 03:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
email protocol or your HTTP protocol
 
03:45:33.590 --> 03:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
right um it's a standard language that
 
03:45:35.229 --> 03:45:35.239 align:start position:0%
people have to use in order to
 
03:45:36.670 --> 03:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
communicate together that's what a
 
03:45:39.110 --> 03:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
protocol basically is so the protocol of
 
03:45:41.429 --> 03:45:41.439 align:start position:0%
the of the network and it it varies
 
03:45:43.110 --> 03:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
depending on what network you're talking
 
03:45:45.630 --> 03:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
about enforces the rules
 
03:45:48.910 --> 03:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
and makes it easy for it's basically the
 
03:45:51.349 --> 03:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
majority of the nodes would say that is
 
03:45:53.990 --> 03:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
not an accurate block right they would
 
03:45:55.309 --> 03:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
they would say according to the rules
 
03:45:57.469 --> 03:45:57.479 align:start position:0%
that we're all playing by that looks
 
03:45:59.710 --> 03:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
suspicious and they'll reject it and
 
03:46:02.349 --> 03:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
then that would punish that node for not
 
03:46:04.630 --> 03:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
complying with the rules right so
 
03:46:06.429 --> 03:46:06.439 align:start position:0%
instead of you know let's say you send
 
03:46:09.670 --> 03:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
me a couple tokens and the bad node
 
03:46:11.710 --> 03:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
intervenes and says it gives your tokens
 
03:46:14.469 --> 03:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
to somebody else right that would be
 
03:46:16.630 --> 03:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
like a simple example of bad acting
 
03:46:18.670 --> 03:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
right so the network would punish that
 
03:46:20.229 --> 03:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
node and that's where the slash would
 
03:46:22.990 --> 03:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
happen of the stake so it's like a it's
 
03:46:25.670 --> 03:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
all risk and reward and
 
03:46:28.189 --> 03:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
incentives yeah follow up you may
 
03:46:31.309 --> 03:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
inquire again so again I'm so everybody
 
03:46:33.910 --> 03:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
has these pass Keys how can you get in
 
03:46:36.670 --> 03:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
to block that you understand what I'm
 
03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
saying if you you know so when you when
 
03:46:40.110 --> 03:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the slashing
 
03:46:43.469 --> 03:46:43.479 align:start position:0%
events yeah so once your your
 
03:46:45.469 --> 03:46:45.479 align:start position:0%
transaction gets
 
03:46:47.590 --> 03:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
let's say I send you something I push a
 
03:46:50.189 --> 03:46:50.199 align:start position:0%
button on my phone that transaction gets
 
03:46:53.550 --> 03:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
broadcast to it's a pool of waiting
 
03:46:55.950 --> 03:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
transactions so there's like a let's say
 
03:46:57.670 --> 03:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
a bucket these are all the transactions
 
03:46:58.870 --> 03:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
that haven't been written to the
 
03:47:00.870 --> 03:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
blockchain yet and what the miners are
 
03:47:02.630 --> 03:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
doing is taking those transactions and
 
03:47:04.550 --> 03:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
minting a block and saying like this is
 
03:47:06.750 --> 03:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
the permanent history of the blockchain
 
03:47:11.389 --> 03:47:11.399 align:start position:0%
and so um so it's after you exercise
 
03:47:14.309 --> 03:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
your control over the over the asset but
 
03:47:15.830 --> 03:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
before it goes on to the blockchain
 
03:47:17.429 --> 03:47:17.439 align:start position:0%
that's where someone can intervene in a
 
03:47:29.990 --> 03:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:33.790 --> 03:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:36.349 --> 03:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
mic I'm probably not the only one here
 
03:47:38.309 --> 03:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of different uh
 
03:47:42.110 --> 03:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
professions and uh education
 
03:47:47.309 --> 03:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
legal etc etc etc that all all
 
03:47:49.910 --> 03:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
are if you're going to be successful
 
03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
have to have a role a role that we're
 
03:47:58.349 --> 03:47:58.359 align:start position:0%
used to using all right so
 
03:48:02.389 --> 03:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
um for example um when you say what is
 
03:48:02.399 --> 03:48:03.149 align:start position:0%
um for example um when you say what is
the

03:48:03.149 --> 03:48:03.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:48:05.510 --> 03:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
asset and I'm going that's a good
 
03:48:08.710 --> 03:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
question what the hell is the asset yeah
 
03:48:12.349 --> 03:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
uh it's a digital something MH all right
 
03:48:14.550 --> 03:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's not an animal it's not a dollar
 
03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
it's not it's an asset so that that
 
03:48:21.030 --> 03:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
throws me right off so the whole the the
 
03:48:23.309 --> 03:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
underlying Innovation behind blockchain
 
03:48:25.990 --> 03:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
is digital scarcity we have never had
 
03:48:27.670 --> 03:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
digital scarcity before it's it's a
 
03:48:29.110 --> 03:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
computer science problem that has been
 
03:48:29.120 --> 03:48:30.030 align:start position:0%
computer science problem that has been
solved

03:48:30.030 --> 03:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
solved
 
03:48:33.189 --> 03:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
once was never solved before so what
 
03:48:36.590 --> 03:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
digital scarcity means is you can create
 
03:48:39.349 --> 03:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
a digital token just think of a big
 
03:48:41.229 --> 03:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
number that you know that no one else
 
03:48:44.229 --> 03:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
has and you can make it so that when I
 
03:48:46.149 --> 03:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
give it to you I no longer possess it
 
03:48:48.670 --> 03:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
right if I take a a Word document or a
 
03:48:50.389 --> 03:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
picture and I and I attach it to an
 
03:48:52.870 --> 03:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
email and I send it to you I still have
 
03:48:54.149 --> 03:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
the word document I still have the
 
03:48:56.830 --> 03:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
picture now there's two of them right so
 
03:48:58.510 --> 03:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
digital assets up until blockchain was
 
03:49:00.550 --> 03:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
invented were
 
03:49:04.389 --> 03:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
infinitely uh replicatable duplicatable
 
03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
and so the Innovation behind blockchain
 
03:49:07.670 --> 03:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
is it it turns a digital asset into
 
03:49:10.550 --> 03:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
something that can be possessed and and
 
03:49:13.149 --> 03:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
transferred and no longer possessed you
 
03:49:14.830 --> 03:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
see what I mean that's really the the
 
03:49:17.750 --> 03:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
the the fundamental Innovation under all
 
03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
of this okay I would I I would like to
 
03:49:23.670 --> 03:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
see a professional come in and I'm not
 
03:49:25.990 --> 03:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
saying you're not professional okay I'm
 
03:49:28.349 --> 03:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I would I would like to see somebody
 
03:49:31.149 --> 03:49:31.159 align:start position:0%
kind of connect the dots yeah not only
 
03:49:34.550 --> 03:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of what a digital asset is
 
03:49:37.309 --> 03:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
whether it's a service or a product
 
03:49:40.750 --> 03:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
where's its value okay where's it proof
 
03:49:44.189 --> 03:49:44.199 align:start position:0%
of value I guess is or yeah and and and
 
03:49:49.670 --> 03:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
also uh when and I want to know uh how
 
03:49:52.670 --> 03:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to regulate it you you you
 
03:49:55.349 --> 03:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
you say you're the way I'm listening to
 
03:49:58.510 --> 03:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
you is it's self-regulated there's a bad
 
03:50:00.790 --> 03:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
guy somebody can come in and try and do
 
03:50:03.710 --> 03:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
something but you've got it this mayy
 
03:50:06.349 --> 03:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
tied up so tight uh that's not going to
 
03:50:09.830 --> 03:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
ever uh cause a problem which I'm not
 
03:50:12.309 --> 03:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
convinced that that's yeah well possible
 
03:50:13.950 --> 03:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
like any technology it can be abused
 
03:50:15.469 --> 03:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
right there there's no sure I'd like to
 
03:50:17.830 --> 03:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
know where the weak points are and and
 
03:50:21.510 --> 03:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
the uh uh uh policy
 
03:50:23.950 --> 03:50:23.960 align:start position:0%
making is if you're going to be in the
 
03:50:26.269 --> 03:50:26.279 align:start position:0%
public sector you're going to have to
 
03:50:29.269 --> 03:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
have some po public policym in other
 
03:50:31.790 --> 03:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
words you just can't go back in the and
 
03:50:35.030 --> 03:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
get your your this fine product and come
 
03:50:36.870 --> 03:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
out and
 
03:50:40.429 --> 03:50:40.439 align:start position:0%
say trust me now I'm gonna it's always
 
03:50:43.030 --> 03:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
going to work and I want a I want a
 
03:50:45.670 --> 03:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
third party that that's associated with
 
03:50:49.429 --> 03:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
the government mhm uh who who can put an
 
03:50:52.910 --> 03:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
their imprimer on it yeah and I I can be
 
03:50:56.149 --> 03:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh satisfied with that well respectfully
 
03:50:57.389 --> 03:50:57.399 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert I don't expect
 
03:51:00.070 --> 03:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
you to vote for this bill ever
 
03:51:02.950 --> 03:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
so and that's okay we cane we disagree
 
03:51:06.950 --> 03:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
you know no no I I just I'm I have a a
 
03:51:08.790 --> 03:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
way of looking at the world and this is
 
03:51:12.189 --> 03:51:12.199 align:start position:0%
a very new product to me and and I and
 
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
what's the trust I mean what I know what
 
03:51:18.110 --> 03:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
a trust is in some other areas is are
 
03:51:22.189 --> 03:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
they the same rules on on on this partic
 
03:51:25.550 --> 03:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
particular product so I'm I'm running
 
03:51:28.269 --> 03:51:28.279 align:start position:0%
into a problem of trying to
 
03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
fix where you are in in the entire realm
 
03:51:37.429 --> 03:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
of uh our our government and our money Y
 
03:51:39.990 --> 03:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
and all those things and I'm I'm not
 
03:51:43.590 --> 03:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
even close to being satisfied so I would
 
03:51:45.429 --> 03:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
like to see profession
 
03:51:51.710 --> 03:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh non uh not neutral individuals who
 
03:51:52.990 --> 03:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
can explain to
 
03:51:56.550 --> 03:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
me uh where the strengths are where the
 
03:51:59.269 --> 03:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
weaknesses are make recommendations
 
03:52:01.429 --> 03:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
where the politics should be all of
 
03:52:03.229 --> 03:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
those things should be coming not from
 
03:52:07.269 --> 03:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
you but from third parties that I would
 
03:52:09.229 --> 03:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
I would
 
03:52:12.030 --> 03:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
trust you know because I can't I you
 
03:52:15.389 --> 03:52:15.399 align:start position:0%
know too much it's like what I know
 
03:52:17.910 --> 03:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
about you know stocks and bonds and
 
03:52:22.670 --> 03:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
Assets in my world I know but now a
 
03:52:25.469 --> 03:52:25.479 align:start position:0%
digital asset comes along and I'm going
 
03:52:28.950 --> 03:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
who was that you know I and it's hard
 
03:52:32.070 --> 03:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's hard to for me to make a vote in my
 
03:52:35.429 --> 03:52:35.439 align:start position:0%
in on behalf of my constituency and be
 
03:52:37.710 --> 03:52:37.720 align:start position:0%
certain that I'm making a a good
 
03:52:39.710 --> 03:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
decision I would believe that
 
03:52:42.149 --> 03:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert thank
 
03:52:45.110 --> 03:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
you okay I think everyone's a chance to
 
03:52:47.950 --> 03:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
ask a question and remember with this is
 
03:52:50.110 --> 03:52:50.120 align:start position:0%

the subcommittee all right thank you I
 
03:53:16.070 --> 03:53:16.080 align:start position:0%

resident of P New Hampshire I also a tax
 
03:53:28.309 --> 03:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
practitioner that's located out of

practitioner that's located out of
hener

03:53:34.030 --> 03:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:39.149 --> 03:53:39.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:41.870 --> 03:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
better there we go okay my name is
 
03:53:45.070 --> 03:53:45.080 align:start position:0%
Patrick Deo I am uh tax practitioner
 
03:53:46.309 --> 03:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
that's located out of hener New
 
03:53:48.830 --> 03:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I also reside in
 
03:53:51.110 --> 03:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
pemr uh I support the
 
03:53:53.910 --> 03:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
bill mostly because of the definitions
 
03:53:56.189 --> 03:53:56.199 align:start position:0%
that are outlaid in it uh considering
 
03:53:58.149 --> 03:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
there's so much Ambu in the terminology
 
03:54:00.229 --> 03:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
that's used in this space I've been
 
03:54:02.070 --> 03:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
working in the digital asset space for
 
03:54:05.630 --> 03:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
about 15 years uh with Emerging Markets
 
03:54:08.189 --> 03:54:08.199 align:start position:0%
both overseas and located in other
 
03:54:11.710 --> 03:54:11.720 align:start position:0%
states and a major hindrance has been
 
03:54:13.790 --> 03:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
the ambiguity both in the judicial and
 
03:54:16.429 --> 03:54:16.439 align:start position:0%
the financial spaces within the various
 
03:54:18.790 --> 03:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
states of our our country and so the
 
03:54:22.189 --> 03:54:22.199 align:start position:0%
hope is to unify the understanding uh
 
03:54:24.189 --> 03:54:24.199 align:start position:0%
between all the verbiage that's being
 
03:54:27.229 --> 03:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
used but also to set up which I you know
 
03:54:30.030 --> 03:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate in here uh a judicial system
 
03:54:32.550 --> 03:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
that can arbitrate things
 
03:54:34.750 --> 03:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
correctly so I don't know if I need to
 
03:54:35.990 --> 03:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's kind of all I really wanted to
 
03:54:36.950 --> 03:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
say I don't know if I needed five
 
03:54:38.910 --> 03:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
minutes or not
 
03:54:42.030 --> 03:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to answer your questions
 
03:54:45.670 --> 03:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
so okay thank you very much
 
03:54:58.990 --> 03:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:01.309 --> 03:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
hayatt Mr chair and members of the
 
03:55:03.670 --> 03:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
committee Ian hwit appearing in a
 
03:55:05.870 --> 03:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
volunteer capacity as a board member of
 
03:55:08.110 --> 03:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire blockchain Council
 
03:55:11.590 --> 03:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
what I'm hoping to do is just go step by
 
03:55:13.389 --> 03:55:13.399 align:start position:0%
step through the issues that were raised
 
03:55:16.030 --> 03:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note not uh until you all
 
03:55:18.030 --> 03:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
tell me to stop and then if possible I
 
03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
would love to take any
 
03:55:23.910 --> 03:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
questions so and I in particular what I
 
03:55:26.349 --> 03:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
want to hit on are uh what the fiscal
 
03:55:28.030 --> 03:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
note says about Securities Law what it
 
03:55:29.590 --> 03:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
says about the potential blockchain
 
03:55:32.469 --> 03:55:32.479 align:start position:0%
dispute docket and then contract and
 
03:55:35.510 --> 03:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
Trust law so first to begin with the uh
 
03:55:37.710 --> 03:55:37.720 align:start position:0%
Securities issue I I thought it was
 
03:55:40.389 --> 03:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
notable that the fiscal note here uh
 
03:55:43.590 --> 03:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
says that the Department of State the
 
03:55:46.189 --> 03:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
Bureau of security ities will lose the
 
03:55:49.070 --> 03:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
ability to regulate Mining and staking
 
03:55:51.349 --> 03:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
it will no longer be able to regulate
 
03:55:52.830 --> 03:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
those as Securities that's how the
 
03:55:55.710 --> 03:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Securities phrased that change
 
03:55:58.309 --> 03:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
but Mining and staking are not
 
03:56:01.910 --> 03:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
Securities under regular established
 
03:56:03.910 --> 03:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
federal or state Securities Law they
 
03:56:05.950 --> 03:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
don't meet really any elements of the
 
03:56:07.950 --> 03:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
legal test for what a security is except
 
03:56:11.149 --> 03:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
that they can generate a profit for you
 
03:56:14.309 --> 03:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
and you know when I read the end of that
 
03:56:16.389 --> 03:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
paragraph I was struck by the fact that
 
03:56:18.870 --> 03:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
the uh Bureau of security says pretty
 
03:56:20.349 --> 03:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
specifically and confidently they
 
03:56:23.630 --> 03:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
anticipate lost profits from not being
 
03:56:25.870 --> 03:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
able to go after people doing and M
 
03:56:28.790 --> 03:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
Mining and staking for um Securities
 
03:56:30.990 --> 03:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
violations and what that suggests to me
 
03:56:32.389 --> 03:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
is it almost seems like the Bureau of
 
03:56:34.630 --> 03:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
Securities would like to adopt a kind of
 
03:56:37.830 --> 03:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
Novel legal Theory to go after people
 
03:56:39.550 --> 03:56:39.560 align:start position:0%
doing Mining and staking there's there's
 
03:56:42.790 --> 03:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
certainly no applicable case law here in
 
03:56:44.590 --> 03:56:44.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire or in New England that
 
03:56:46.990 --> 03:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
would suggest that mining or staking
 
03:56:50.309 --> 03:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
could be a form of security so I thought
 
03:56:52.070 --> 03:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
that point actually really underscored
 
03:56:54.030 --> 03:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
the recommendation in the governor's
 
03:56:55.950 --> 03:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
commission that when you have a new
 
03:56:58.229 --> 03:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
technology people don't fully understand
 
03:57:01.189 --> 03:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
the uncertainty around that can allow
 
03:57:04.429 --> 03:57:04.439 align:start position:0%
for novel regulation by enforcement that
 
03:57:06.990 --> 03:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
can deter Innovation and development so
 
03:57:08.469 --> 03:57:08.479 align:start position:0%
I think that underscores the
 
03:57:10.389 --> 03:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the commission to
 
03:57:12.550 --> 03:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
encourage development and innovation in
 
03:57:14.429 --> 03:57:14.439 align:start position:0%
this area in New Hampshire by creating
 
03:57:16.349 --> 03:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
more clarity and stability around in
 
03:57:18.950 --> 03:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
this case what is and is not a Security
 
03:57:20.070 --> 03:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
even though this is really just a
 
03:57:22.710 --> 03:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
codification of our regular uh State
 
03:57:25.070 --> 03:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
statutory and other Securities tests
 
03:57:28.550 --> 03:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
that we would apply in New Hampshire the
 
03:57:30.710 --> 03:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh proposed blockchain dispute docket
 
03:57:32.670 --> 03:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
these Provisions are just modeled pretty
 
03:57:35.070 --> 03:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
directly on the existing RSA creating
 
03:57:36.830 --> 03:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
our business dispute dispute docket
 
03:57:38.389 --> 03:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
which I'm sure many of you are familiar
 
03:57:40.309 --> 03:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
with um but in case you're not I thought
 
03:57:42.870 --> 03:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
it'd be worth pointing out that this
 
03:57:46.469 --> 03:57:46.479 align:start position:0%
350k cost cost that um is warned about
 
03:57:49.710 --> 03:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
here by the Judiciary in the fiscal note
 
03:57:53.030 --> 03:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
even if uh this bill were to pass and
 
03:57:54.830 --> 03:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
then governor aot and the executive
 
03:57:56.550 --> 03:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
Council were very proactive and
 
03:57:58.630 --> 03:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial and said we want to set
 
03:58:00.269 --> 03:58:00.279 align:start position:0%
this dispute docket up right away and
 
03:58:02.910 --> 03:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
Implement uh Governor shu's commission's
 
03:58:05.750 --> 03:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations even then that 350k
 
03:58:08.469 --> 03:58:08.479 align:start position:0%
expense would not be incurred by the
 
03:58:11.030 --> 03:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
state until there was a lot of
 
03:58:13.110 --> 03:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
profitable business in this area
 
03:58:14.710 --> 03:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
happening in New Hampshire
 
03:58:15.990 --> 03:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is if you look
 
03:58:17.870 --> 03:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
at the way the just regular business
 
03:58:19.710 --> 03:58:19.720 align:start position:0%
dispute docket works now which is the
 
03:58:22.229 --> 03:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
same system the presiding judge of that
 
03:58:24.670 --> 03:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
docket is Judge David Anderson and he
 
03:58:27.349 --> 03:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
does have an active uh business dispute
 
03:58:29.189 --> 03:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
docket and I'm sure many of you have had
 
03:58:31.710 --> 03:58:31.720 align:start position:0%
interactions with it but he also does
 
03:58:34.269 --> 03:58:34.279 align:start position:0%
just all kinds of other regular Superior
 
03:58:36.950 --> 03:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
Court cases when he's not doing uh
 
03:58:39.110 --> 03:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
business docket cases so what would
 
03:58:41.349 --> 03:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
happen if uh governor aod and the
 
03:58:43.550 --> 03:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
council created this blockchain docket
 
03:58:44.630 --> 03:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
right away
 
03:58:46.469 --> 03:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
is an existing judge would be assigned
 
03:58:48.830 --> 03:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
to it a judge with specialization in law
 
03:58:51.389 --> 03:58:51.399 align:start position:0%
and technology and then the docket would
 
03:58:53.750 --> 03:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
mostly just sit there while the judge
 
03:58:56.990 --> 03:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
continued to do their other work but
 
03:58:59.550 --> 03:58:59.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully in the meantime people doing
 
03:59:01.229 --> 03:59:01.239 align:start position:0%
blockchain related business especially
 
03:59:03.630 --> 03:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
in other states in New England would see
 
03:59:05.990 --> 03:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has this specialization
 
03:59:08.189 --> 03:59:08.199 align:start position:0%
expertise and stability in blockchain
 
03:59:10.790 --> 03:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
related business let's move there and
 
03:59:12.349 --> 03:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
then that would increase the amount of
 
03:59:14.229 --> 03:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
business happening on the blockchain
 
03:59:16.870 --> 03:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
dispute docket and then finally the the
 
03:59:20.229 --> 03:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
contract law and the trust law uh this
 
03:59:24.429 --> 03:59:24.439 align:start position:0%
came up earlier but smart contracts and
 
03:59:26.670 --> 03:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
common law contracts are really totally
 
03:59:29.030 --> 03:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
different things and this is actually an
 
03:59:30.950 --> 03:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
area where you know oftentimes uh
 
03:59:32.870 --> 03:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
lawyers like me will will make really
 
03:59:35.110 --> 03:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
kind of uninformed statements about
 
03:59:37.229 --> 03:59:37.239 align:start position:0%
blockchain technology around smart
 
03:59:39.030 --> 03:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
contracts sometimes the technologists
 
03:59:40.510 --> 03:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
make really uninformed statements about
 
03:59:42.510 --> 03:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
the law because they can even assume
 
03:59:44.830 --> 03:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
smart contracts are a form of legal
 
03:59:47.070 --> 03:59:47.080 align:start position:0%
contract and that's just not the case um
 
03:59:48.670 --> 03:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
you know a smart contract for example
 
03:59:50.950 --> 03:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
can keep operating and doing exactly
 
03:59:53.030 --> 03:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
what it it was intended to do when let's
 
03:59:55.590 --> 03:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
say all the parties are are dead so
 
03:59:57.349 --> 03:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
there's there's no two parties there who
 
03:59:59.189 --> 03:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
have any kind of offer acceptance
 
04:00:01.070 --> 04:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
consideration and the smart contract is
 
04:00:03.189 --> 04:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
is still running just to give an example
 
04:00:05.149 --> 04:00:05.159 align:start position:0%
so it's it's orthogonal it's a separate
 
04:00:07.149 --> 04:00:07.159 align:start position:0%
thing and representative Ammon does
 
04:00:09.469 --> 04:00:09.479 align:start position:0%
clarify in the definition section here
 
04:00:11.349 --> 04:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
that smart contracts and legal contracts
 
04:00:12.950 --> 04:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
are really are really different things
 
04:00:15.550 --> 04:00:15.560 align:start position:0%
although one could be used to facilitate
 
04:00:18.149 --> 04:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
the other um there's a note here in the
 
04:00:21.189 --> 04:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that no court is given
 
04:00:24.229 --> 04:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
exclusive jurisdiction over trusts
 
04:00:27.189 --> 04:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
operated through a smart contract and
 
04:00:28.710 --> 04:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the provisions in this
 
04:00:31.030 --> 04:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
bill are not to give any Court exclusive
 
04:00:32.590 --> 04:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction or take any Court's
 
04:00:34.950 --> 04:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
Jurisdiction away but just to provide
 
04:00:37.349 --> 04:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
Clarity around what the legal principles
 
04:00:40.630 --> 04:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
are that would apply to someone who in
 
04:00:43.229 --> 04:00:43.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire tried to use a Smart
 
04:00:46.590 --> 04:00:46.600 align:start position:0%
contract to to facilitate a self-settled
 
04:00:48.229 --> 04:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
asset protection trust under under
 
04:00:50.110 --> 04:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
current New Hampshire asset protection
 
04:00:52.630 --> 04:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
trust law and then at the end there's
 
04:00:54.590 --> 04:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
the statement that well there's some
 
04:00:57.229 --> 04:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
ambiguities here and those ambiguities
 
04:00:58.750 --> 04:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh I think the Bureau of security
 
04:01:00.110 --> 04:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
suggested could create additional
 
04:01:02.550 --> 04:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
litigation and additional expenses and I
 
04:01:05.710 --> 04:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
would say on the contrary if if an
 
04:01:08.189 --> 04:01:08.199 align:start position:0%
attorney uh for example never has any
 
04:01:09.910 --> 04:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
intention of dealing with smart
 
04:01:12.790 --> 04:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
contracts in their practice there any
 
04:01:15.030 --> 04:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
RSA that speaks about smart contracts
 
04:01:16.389 --> 04:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
that attorney is probably going to look
 
04:01:17.830 --> 04:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
at it and not really understand what
 
04:01:19.469 --> 04:01:19.479 align:start position:0%
it's talking about and I think that's
 
04:01:21.389 --> 04:01:21.399 align:start position:0%
probably just unavoidable you can't you
 
04:01:22.630 --> 04:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
know provide all the background
 
04:01:24.189 --> 04:01:24.199 align:start position:0%
necessary to explain that concept to the
 
04:01:27.070 --> 04:01:27.080 align:start position:0%
attorney in the RSA but I think any
 
04:01:29.269 --> 04:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
practitioner who deals with law and
 
04:01:31.269 --> 04:01:31.279 align:start position:0%
blockchain technology or any business
 
04:01:33.590 --> 04:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
person who deals with blockchain related
 
04:01:36.030 --> 04:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
technology would look at these rsas and
 
04:01:38.189 --> 04:01:38.199 align:start position:0%
it would provide additional Clarity and
 
04:01:40.670 --> 04:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
stability that would speak to exactly
 
04:01:42.750 --> 04:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
the sorts of confusion uh that are
 
04:01:44.830 --> 04:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
gestured at by some of the fiscal note
 
04:01:46.830 --> 04:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
here and last last Quick couple of
 
04:01:49.070 --> 04:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
sentences here I I see representative uh
 
04:01:50.910 --> 04:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
spear I believe it was left but I just
 
04:01:53.990 --> 04:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak to the energy um and
 
04:01:56.229 --> 04:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
environmental concerns that she raised
 
04:01:58.309 --> 04:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to draw your attention to
 
04:02:00.670 --> 04:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
one aspect of this bill that is pretty
 
04:02:03.950 --> 04:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
unique to New Hampshire is page 3 um 34
 
04:02:06.910 --> 04:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
and 36 there's a special provision
 
04:02:09.469 --> 04:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
clarifying that subdivisions can offer
 
04:02:11.670 --> 04:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
positive incentives to encourage
 
04:02:13.429 --> 04:02:13.439 align:start position:0%
blockchain related businesses to favor
 
04:02:16.030 --> 04:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
proof of stake validation over proof of
 
04:02:18.870 --> 04:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
work and that is in here for purely
 
04:02:21.110 --> 04:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
environmental and energy use reasons
 
04:02:23.149 --> 04:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
because some political subdivisions may
 
04:02:25.910 --> 04:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
want to steer people towards this more
 
04:02:29.229 --> 04:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
energy efficient uh method of validation
 
04:02:31.830 --> 04:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
and the the intention there was not to
 
04:02:33.590 --> 04:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
deter those subdivisions from trying to
 
04:02:35.229 --> 04:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
promote environmentally friendly
 
04:02:37.990 --> 04:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
practices in blockchain business and uh
 
04:02:41.429 --> 04:02:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:45.510 --> 04:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gibbs
 
04:02:45.520 --> 04:02:46.510 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gibbs
thank

04:02:46.510 --> 04:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:02:48.630 --> 04:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for coming in to
 
04:02:51.910 --> 04:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
testify this afternoon thank you um you
 
04:02:55.750 --> 04:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um the uh expense to the
 
04:02:59.790 --> 04:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
judicial system would only come if um
 
04:03:01.309 --> 04:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of profitable
 
04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
blockchain business but if there were a
 
04:03:08.030 --> 04:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
lot of blockchain B business um and
 
04:03:10.469 --> 04:03:10.479 align:start position:0%
therefore a lot of cases went to the
 
04:03:13.149 --> 04:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
blockchain docket wouldn't it be true
 
04:03:14.710 --> 04:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
that either
 
04:03:16.830 --> 04:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
um the system would have to hire a new
 
04:03:19.389 --> 04:03:19.399 align:start position:0%
judge at the expense of
 
04:03:24.149 --> 04:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
$350,000 or um since uh one judge would
 
04:03:26.110 --> 04:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
be taking all of that blockchain
 
04:03:28.670 --> 04:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
business wouldn't all the other judges
 
04:03:31.790 --> 04:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
have to uh take on a lot of extra work
 
04:03:33.950 --> 04:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't that be a loss to the J
 
04:03:37.510 --> 04:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
Judicial System either way well so
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
currently the way it works with the
 
04:03:40.309 --> 04:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
business dispute docket and if if you
 
04:03:42.189 --> 04:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
look at the business dispute docket rsas
 
04:03:43.429 --> 04:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
you'll see representative Ammon has
 
04:03:45.590 --> 04:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
basically just taken that exact text and
 
04:03:47.950 --> 04:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
subbed in blockchain instead of uh
 
04:03:49.590 --> 04:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
business which was the governor's
 
04:03:51.309 --> 04:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
commission's recommendation for creating
 
04:03:53.670 --> 04:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
this new dispute docket and what happens
 
04:03:57.189 --> 04:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
there is uh pretty a lot of the cases I
 
04:03:58.830 --> 04:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
think all of the cases on the business
 
04:04:00.269 --> 04:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
dispute docket go to Judge David
 
04:04:02.030 --> 04:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
Anderson currently uh who is the
 
04:04:05.149 --> 04:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
presiding judge but he does not work
 
04:04:07.750 --> 04:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
exclusively on the business dispute
 
04:04:09.910 --> 04:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
docket so even there that's a pretty
 
04:04:11.630 --> 04:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
active docket but we don't have enough
 
04:04:13.349 --> 04:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
litigation there in the state to take
 
04:04:15.950 --> 04:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
him away away totally from all the other
 
04:04:18.469 --> 04:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
cases um and it's not as if we've
 
04:04:20.389 --> 04:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
reassigned a judge just to the business
 
04:04:22.590 --> 04:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
dispute docket so now all of the other
 
04:04:24.149 --> 04:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
cases he would have handled are kind of
 
04:04:26.110 --> 04:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
left to all of the other judges he he
 
04:04:29.429 --> 04:04:29.439 align:start position:0%
works on both so the only situation in
 
04:04:32.110 --> 04:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
which the Judiciary would hire a new
 
04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
judge just to you know expend 350k just
 
04:04:38.670 --> 04:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
handle all the blockchain business would
 
04:04:40.469 --> 04:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
be after we've already established the
 
04:04:41.830 --> 04:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
blockchain dispute docket it's been
 
04:04:43.030 --> 04:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
around for a while it's probably been
 
04:04:45.550 --> 04:04:45.560 align:start position:0%
mostly inac but now we've got all this
 
04:04:47.710 --> 04:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
so much blockchain business in New
 
04:04:49.950 --> 04:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and litigation that the
 
04:04:51.790 --> 04:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
Judiciary says we need a specialist
 
04:04:55.070 --> 04:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
judge who works just on this stuff and
 
04:04:57.710 --> 04:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
at that point potentially this 350k
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:04.590 --> 04:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
incurred anyone

I'm waiting for I'm waiting for the

and I can't move I can't move forward
 
04:05:58.790 --> 04:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
because the prime sponsor of 538 is the

Property and Casualty unit within the
 
04:09:13.389 --> 04:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
department I've got a whole host of
 
04:09:16.189 --> 04:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
folks in the back should any of you need
 
04:09:16.199 --> 04:09:17.830 align:start position:0%
folks in the back should any of you need
their

04:09:17.830 --> 04:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:09:20.950 --> 04:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
wisdom the vast majority of House Bill
 
04:09:23.710 --> 04:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
499 is ministerial we are trying to
 
04:09:26.109 --> 04:09:26.119 align:start position:0%
clean up and clear up some of our
 
04:09:29.510 --> 04:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
statutes we have done this I think this
 
04:09:31.389 --> 04:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
is our third or fourth time bringing
 
04:09:33.990 --> 04:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
forward a bill of this kind again just
 
04:09:35.670 --> 04:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
trying to clean up the statutes bring
 
04:09:38.950 --> 04:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
nomenclature up to present time clean up
 
04:09:42.630 --> 04:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
some things that were not uh properly
 
04:09:45.309 --> 04:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
tidied up as we passed other pieces of
 
04:09:47.670 --> 04:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
legislation over the years but there are
 
04:09:49.149 --> 04:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
obviously some highlights that I would
 
04:09:50.670 --> 04:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
draw to your
 
04:09:54.870 --> 04:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
attention so on page one you will see on
 
04:09:58.070 --> 04:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
lines 12 through
 
04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
18 so this particular provision came as
 
04:10:07.149 --> 04:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
a result of an entirely unrelated matter
 
04:10:09.910 --> 04:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
to Property and Casualty lines of
 
04:10:12.309 --> 04:10:12.319 align:start position:0%
business which is what that particular
 
04:10:14.070 --> 04:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
section speaks to
 
04:10:16.429 --> 04:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
but it did help make us aware of the
 
04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
fact there was something that needed to
 
04:10:19.710 --> 04:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
be addressed there as well so the
 
04:10:21.830 --> 04:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
incident that arose very briefly this
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
fall as many of you know because you
 
04:10:25.590 --> 04:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
were likely either impacted yourselves
 
04:10:27.670 --> 04:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
or you were hearing from constituents
 
04:10:29.469 --> 04:10:29.479 align:start position:0%
was there was a large disruption in the
 
04:10:32.590 --> 04:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage Market a lot of
 
04:10:34.910 --> 04:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
companies were deciding to withdraw from
 
04:10:37.590 --> 04:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
offering products in that market others
 
04:10:40.550 --> 04:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
were dramatically changing their current
 
04:10:42.830 --> 04:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
offerings and there was one carrier
 
04:10:46.030 --> 04:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
foron reasons still not known to me that
 
04:10:47.429 --> 04:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
decided that they were not going to
 
04:10:49.349 --> 04:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
write business anymore in straford
 
04:10:51.510 --> 04:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
County I don't know who in straford
 
04:10:53.870 --> 04:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
County aggravated them but they weren't
 
04:10:56.469 --> 04:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
writing in straford County anymore now
 
04:10:58.590 --> 04:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage is not a product that
 
04:11:01.070 --> 04:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
the insurance department regulates that
 
04:11:03.630 --> 04:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
is overseen by the federal government
 
04:11:06.189 --> 04:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
understandably the public is not
 
04:11:07.750 --> 04:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
completely familiar with the products
 
04:11:10.189 --> 04:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
that we do and do not regulate they hear
 
04:11:12.149 --> 04:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
insurance they see insurance department
 
04:11:14.030 --> 04:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
they came to us to get some assistance
 
04:11:16.510 --> 04:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
and we were happy to do that there's a
 
04:11:18.349 --> 04:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
little bit of a Nuance in the Medicare
 
04:11:20.189 --> 04:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
space in the sense that we do not
 
04:11:22.950 --> 04:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
oversee underlying Medicare we do not
 
04:11:26.030 --> 04:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
oversee or regulate Medicare Advantage
 
04:11:29.189 --> 04:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
we do oversee Medicare supplemental
 
04:11:32.030 --> 04:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
plans and so in addition to us trying to
 
04:11:34.189 --> 04:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
be good stewards of education and
 
04:11:36.389 --> 04:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
guidance to the public there was a
 
04:11:38.990 --> 04:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
direct policy implication for the
 
04:11:41.870 --> 04:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
Department because as a result of the
 
04:11:43.309 --> 04:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
disruption in that market the the
 
04:11:45.149 --> 04:11:45.159 align:start position:0%
federal government allowed people if
 
04:11:47.269 --> 04:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
they so chose who had lost their
 
04:11:51.790 --> 04:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage plan to switch over
 
04:11:54.429 --> 04:11:54.439 align:start position:0%
to Medicare supplemental without
 
04:11:56.109 --> 04:11:56.119 align:start position:0%
underwriting they had extended
 
04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
guaranteed issue for those products as a
 
04:12:02.910 --> 04:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
result of this disruption and so as
 
04:12:05.149 --> 04:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
we're trying to field these calls as
 
04:12:07.670 --> 04:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to put helpful information
 
04:12:10.510 --> 04:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
out to the public and to those impacted
 
04:12:13.790 --> 04:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
it became unbelievably difficult I
 
04:12:17.030 --> 04:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
termed it a bit of a fog of War to
 
04:12:19.750 --> 04:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
understand what carrier was doing what
 
04:12:22.590 --> 04:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
exactly some carriers had put out press
 
04:12:23.670 --> 04:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
releases saying that they were
 
04:12:25.790 --> 04:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
withdrawing entirely for those who did
 
04:12:28.030 --> 04:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
that we obviously knew but we were
 
04:12:30.149 --> 04:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
hearing from Agents and Brokers and
 
04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
others that were saying I don't know
 
04:12:34.550 --> 04:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
what's going on but the plan that I've
 
04:12:36.590 --> 04:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
had before is going
 
04:12:39.550 --> 04:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
away and as I said we didn't know what
 
04:12:41.349 --> 04:12:41.359 align:start position:0%
each and every carrier was doing so
 
04:12:43.630 --> 04:12:43.640 align:start position:0%
we've brought forward in a separate bill
 
04:12:45.510 --> 04:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
a notification provision that says if
 
04:12:47.149 --> 04:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
you're withdrawing from the market if
 
04:12:49.189 --> 04:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
you are dramatically changing your
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
current offerings or if you're not going
 
04:12:54.389 --> 04:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
to write in a county or counties you've
 
04:12:56.189 --> 04:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
just got to notify the department so
 
04:12:58.109 --> 04:12:58.119 align:start position:0%
that when people come to us we are able
 
04:12:59.870 --> 04:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
to be in a position to explain to them
 
04:13:01.229 --> 04:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
exactly what's
 
04:13:03.670 --> 04:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
happening we took that exact same
 
04:13:06.269 --> 04:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
principle and we have applied it to the
 
04:13:09.349 --> 04:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
PNC lines of business my understanding
 
04:13:11.710 --> 04:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
is that currently there is a requirement
 
04:13:14.189 --> 04:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the agents to notify we are
 
04:13:16.750 --> 04:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
extending that notification requirement
 
04:13:19.309 --> 04:13:19.319 align:start position:0%
to the companies as well let me be very
 
04:13:21.710 --> 04:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
clear I have taken the absolute lightest
 
04:13:23.830 --> 04:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
touch I possibly could with this
 
04:13:26.790 --> 04:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
notification requirement all it takes is
 
04:13:29.870 --> 04:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
for the company to send me an email for
 
04:13:31.950 --> 04:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
XY and Z reason we are no longer going
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
to be offering XY orz coverage that's it
 
04:13:38.590 --> 04:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not asking for certified mail on
 
04:13:40.870 --> 04:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
parchment paper delivered by a stor
 
04:13:43.830 --> 04:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
using only red ink some states do that
 
04:13:45.510 --> 04:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
we're not doing that I just want the
 
04:13:47.670 --> 04:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
heads up so that when the calls come in
 
04:13:50.189 --> 04:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
from consumers I know what's going on
 
04:13:52.550 --> 04:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
and I in my department our best position
 
04:13:54.389 --> 04:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide guidance to those
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
consumers yes doesn't this fly on the
 
04:13:59.389 --> 04:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
face of network
 
04:14:01.349 --> 04:14:01.359 align:start position:0%
adequacy when it comes to like health
 
04:14:03.030 --> 04:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
insurance we would never let a health
 
04:14:04.830 --> 04:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
insurance company do that but you're
 
04:14:06.830 --> 04:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
saying you're going to let it okay with
 
04:14:06.840 --> 04:14:08.229 align:start position:0%
saying you're going to let it okay with
the

04:14:08.229 --> 04:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
supplementals so when we're talking
 
04:14:13.189 --> 04:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
specifically about Medicare Advantage
 
04:14:15.030 --> 04:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
how we had to do this is because we do
 
04:14:17.670 --> 04:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
not regulate those products at all at
 
04:14:20.870 --> 04:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
all we put but we do license the
 
04:14:23.469 --> 04:14:23.479 align:start position:0%
companies that sell those products so
 
04:14:25.590 --> 04:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
what we put the notification requirement
 
04:14:28.630 --> 04:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
into was the area of the statute the
 
04:14:31.590 --> 04:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
licensing statute where we basically say
 
04:14:33.510 --> 04:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
as a condition of you getting your
 
04:14:34.950 --> 04:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
license in addition to everything else
 
04:14:37.550 --> 04:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
you're required to do you're also going
 
04:14:40.510 --> 04:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
to agree to this notification provision
 
04:14:42.149 --> 04:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
should you decide you're going to not
 
04:14:44.469 --> 04:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
write that line any anymore or any of
 
04:14:46.429 --> 04:14:46.439 align:start position:0%
the other things that I've described we
 
04:14:47.950 --> 04:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't get into the substance because
 
04:14:49.670 --> 04:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
you run into Federal preemption issues
 
04:14:52.189 --> 04:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
it's not a product that we regulate the
 
04:14:54.269 --> 04:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
only way we could get at that particular
 
04:14:57.349 --> 04:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
issue within State Statute was to look
 
04:14:59.309 --> 04:14:59.319 align:start position:0%
to the licensing right well I guess my
 
04:15:02.189 --> 04:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
concern is that when it came to the
 
04:15:05.070 --> 04:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
concept of network adequacy is that we
 
04:15:07.750 --> 04:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
are we were fearful that insurance
 
04:15:09.469 --> 04:15:09.479 align:start position:0%
company and actually it's the same one
 
04:15:11.070 --> 04:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
who just pulled out of her supplemental
 
04:15:14.349 --> 04:15:14.359 align:start position:0%
Market that same company was doing a uh
 
04:15:16.630 --> 04:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
an inadequate job of providing having
 
04:15:19.870 --> 04:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
providers in the North Country so now
 
04:15:21.429 --> 04:15:21.439 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is Well gee we're
 
04:15:23.109 --> 04:15:23.119 align:start position:0%
going to let even Property and Casualty
 
04:15:24.590 --> 04:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
companies to pull out of the North
 
04:15:27.830 --> 04:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
country and and have less less insurance
 
04:15:29.830 --> 04:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
companies up there well unless I'm
 
04:15:33.510 --> 04:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
mistaken we don't have Network adequacy
 
04:15:35.670 --> 04:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
like requirements in the PNC world the
 
04:15:38.550 --> 04:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
way we do with health insurance so if a
 
04:15:41.030 --> 04:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
carrier chooses not to write in a
 
04:15:44.269 --> 04:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
particular area they don't have
 
04:15:48.309 --> 04:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
to and I would just point out there are
 
04:15:50.309 --> 04:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
some states I won't mention who they are
 
04:15:53.389 --> 04:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
but California that tried to do things
 
04:15:55.950 --> 04:15:55.960 align:start position:0%
like that and the consequence of that
 
04:15:57.750 --> 04:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
was that the carrier decided to pull out
 
04:16:00.429 --> 04:16:00.439 align:start position:0%
of the state altogether completely yeah
 
04:16:03.030 --> 04:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
and so that was one of a number of
 
04:16:04.670 --> 04:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
different things that has caused
 
04:16:07.429 --> 04:16:07.439 align:start position:0%
California's Insurance Market to be in a
 
04:16:10.269 --> 04:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
very bad place right but we do run the
 
04:16:13.070 --> 04:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
risk of with passing this that we could
 
04:16:16.469 --> 04:16:16.479 align:start position:0%
have some coming going forward some
 
04:16:17.950 --> 04:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
insurance company deciding that they
 
04:16:20.750 --> 04:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to do well there's nothing to
 
04:16:23.070 --> 04:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
prevent count no but there's nothing to
 
04:16:25.070 --> 04:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
prevent them from doing that now all of
 
04:16:26.910 --> 04:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
this provision does is say if you're
 
04:16:29.070 --> 04:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
going to do that you've got to let us
 
04:16:31.109 --> 04:16:31.119 align:start position:0%
know yep right that's fine it's a pure
 
04:16:33.950 --> 04:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
notification requirement okay in any
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
event a little bit of cleanup language
 
04:16:38.590 --> 04:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
there is it pertains to the Department's
 
04:16:40.990 --> 04:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
work with Surplus lines company I don't
 
04:16:42.030 --> 04:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
think Emily is there anything you want
 
04:16:43.469 --> 04:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
to highlight with that
 
04:16:47.550 --> 04:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
um this is just to um this provision um
 
04:16:51.670 --> 04:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
just clarifies that for um policies that
 
04:16:53.189 --> 04:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
are ridden on New Hampshire risk that
 
04:16:55.750 --> 04:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
insurance companies need to use a New
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Insurance licensed
 
04:17:00.269 --> 04:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
adjuster and then um and that would
 
04:17:02.429 --> 04:17:02.439 align:start position:0%
include the Surplus lines companies um
 
04:17:05.070 --> 04:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
so this is just a clarification that for
 
04:17:07.429 --> 04:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire policies on New Hampshire
 
04:17:09.790 --> 04:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
RIS that carriers including Surplus
 
04:17:11.429 --> 04:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
lines carriers need to use a New
 
04:17:14.109 --> 04:17:14.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire licensed claim adjuster to
 
04:17:15.550 --> 04:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
handle the
 
04:17:21.070 --> 04:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:23.590 --> 04:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
claims all right there are any questions
 
04:17:27.710 --> 04:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:29.830 --> 04:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman looks like I got a
 
04:17:32.870 --> 04:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
question yes representative mle yes uh
 
04:17:35.790 --> 04:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um just a clarification um if
 
04:17:38.670 --> 04:17:38.680 align:start position:0%
a insurance company says they're going
 
04:17:40.950 --> 04:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
to pull out of the
 
04:17:43.269 --> 04:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
state I don't believe that they can
 
04:17:46.030 --> 04:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
cancel a policy in force what they're
 
04:17:47.670 --> 04:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
really saying is we're we're not going
 
04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
to we're not going to renew that policy
 
04:17:50.510 --> 04:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
we're not going to take any more
 
04:17:53.910 --> 04:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
business that's right thank you yep
 
04:17:56.349 --> 04:17:56.359 align:start position:0%
that's what they
 
04:18:00.189 --> 04:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
did all right very good so moving on and
 
04:18:01.750 --> 04:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
again I'm skipping over a couple of
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
things that in my mind are purely
 
04:18:05.149 --> 04:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
ministerial but if they trigger
 
04:18:07.630 --> 04:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
something for you by all means just just
 
04:18:08.910 --> 04:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
say which section of the bill you're
 
04:18:11.349 --> 04:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
doing sure so I'm going to skip over to
 
04:18:13.469 --> 04:18:13.479 align:start position:0%
page three
 
04:18:17.670 --> 04:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
holy moly okay and I'm looking at lines
 
04:18:20.630 --> 04:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
26 through
 
04:18:25.229 --> 04:18:25.239 align:start position:0%
27 so as you know within our department
 
04:18:27.790 --> 04:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
we have our financial regulation unit
 
04:18:30.109 --> 04:18:30.119 align:start position:0%
that is the unit in charge of overseeing
 
04:18:33.309 --> 04:18:33.319 align:start position:0%
the Financial Health the financial
 
04:18:35.790 --> 04:18:35.800 align:start position:0%
viability of companies doing operation
 
04:18:37.149 --> 04:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we're making sure that
 
04:18:38.790 --> 04:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
they have adequate reserves we're making
 
04:18:41.070 --> 04:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
sure they're in Good Financial Health
 
04:18:42.910 --> 04:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
obvious reason being very difficult for
 
04:18:44.349 --> 04:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
an insurance company to pay claims if
 
04:18:47.710 --> 04:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
they're bankrupt one of the things that
 
04:18:50.510 --> 04:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
we require when a company is looking to
 
04:18:53.309 --> 04:18:53.319 align:start position:0%
form in New Hampshire and domesticate in
 
04:18:56.109 --> 04:18:56.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that they have certain
 
04:18:59.429 --> 04:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
assets certain dollars
 
04:19:02.429 --> 04:19:02.439 align:start position:0%
upfront so that we know on day one
 
04:19:04.870 --> 04:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to be in a decent
 
04:19:07.429 --> 04:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
financial position to be able to start
 
04:19:09.349 --> 04:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
begin offering and writing policies and
 
04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
be able to cover any claims that come in
 
04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
under those policies
 
04:19:15.189 --> 04:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
the financial reg team has said that
 
04:19:17.830 --> 04:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
because the provision currently says
 
04:19:21.990 --> 04:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
that the dollar amount that is set for
 
04:19:24.870 --> 04:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
the conversation to even begin which is
 
04:19:24.880 --> 04:19:26.389 align:start position:0%
the conversation to even begin which is
at

04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:19:29.590 --> 04:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
$800,000 is so low they are being
 
04:19:33.109 --> 04:19:33.119 align:start position:0%
inundated with all sorts of interesting
 
04:19:35.910 --> 04:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
characters with very interesting ideas
 
04:19:37.910 --> 04:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
as to the types of insurance
 
04:19:40.990 --> 04:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
companies that they would like to form
 
04:19:43.349 --> 04:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
and domesticate here in New Hampshire
 
04:19:46.070 --> 04:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
and in a lot of cases it's just not a
 
04:19:48.510 --> 04:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
serious proposal and it takes up a lot
 
04:19:49.830 --> 04:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
of time and
 
04:19:52.630 --> 04:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
resources so I said what is the
 
04:19:54.790 --> 04:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount to set there such
 
04:19:57.750 --> 04:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
that we are weeding out the non-serious
 
04:20:01.109 --> 04:20:01.119 align:start position:0%
actors from while also at the same time
 
04:20:02.990 --> 04:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we are not setting the bar
 
04:20:06.510 --> 04:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
so high that we are stifling new players
 
04:20:08.790 --> 04:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
that want to enter the
 
04:20:12.790 --> 04:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
market and my lovable math nerds came to
 
04:20:16.510 --> 04:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
me and said $3 million is a serious
 
04:20:18.950 --> 04:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
number that again is not doing anything
 
04:20:21.790 --> 04:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
to stifle or drive away potentially
 
04:20:24.630 --> 04:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
interested players who want to again
 
04:20:26.189 --> 04:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
enter the New Hampshire Market in a very
 
04:20:28.229 --> 04:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
serious way which is to say form and
 
04:20:31.149 --> 04:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
then domesticate here so that's what is
 
04:20:31.159 --> 04:20:33.590 align:start position:0%
then domesticate here so that's what is
reflected

04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
reflected
 
04:20:37.229 --> 04:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
there heading over to page four looking
 
04:20:39.910 --> 04:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
at lines 8 through 14 and then really
 
04:20:41.429 --> 04:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
extending over the course of the next
 
04:20:44.189 --> 04:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
couple of pages
 
04:20:46.149 --> 04:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
we are eliminating a number of
 
04:20:49.630 --> 04:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
fees and I appreciate that like all of
 
04:20:51.550 --> 04:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
you you see the revenue statements that
 
04:20:54.870 --> 04:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
come in certain revenues are not doing
 
04:20:57.750 --> 04:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
as well as hoped I completely understand
 
04:20:59.710 --> 04:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
that I do not want to compound that
 
04:21:02.229 --> 04:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
problem I had a great conversation
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
earlier this week with your colleagues
 
04:21:05.469 --> 04:21:05.479 align:start position:0%
over at Ways and Means I think they're
 
04:21:07.229 --> 04:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
pretty happy with me the insurance
 
04:21:08.910 --> 04:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
premium tax is doing
 
04:21:11.510 --> 04:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
well but there are some fees that our
 
04:21:14.429 --> 04:21:14.439 align:start position:0%
licensing unit has come to us and said
 
04:21:19.189 --> 04:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
look the cost that it takes to collect
 
04:21:21.990 --> 04:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
these fees and to enforce compliance
 
04:21:26.109 --> 04:21:26.119 align:start position:0%
with these fees way outstrips the actual
 
04:21:28.030 --> 04:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
amount of Revenue that the state is
 
04:21:30.269 --> 04:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
getting from this and I think that what
 
04:21:32.550 --> 04:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here is reflected in
 
04:21:34.710 --> 04:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note which is the totality of
 
04:21:37.429 --> 04:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
the fees that we're talking about here
 
04:21:40.469 --> 04:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
are in the range of 20 to
 
04:21:43.269 --> 04:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
$330,000 and again the time and effort
 
04:21:45.189 --> 04:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
having to chase people around some of
 
04:21:47.510 --> 04:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
these fees make absolutely no sense you
 
04:21:50.309 --> 04:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
know charging somebody a fee because
 
04:21:52.990 --> 04:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
they're changing their name on their
 
04:21:55.750 --> 04:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
license because they got
 
04:21:59.269 --> 04:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
married I mean really I just think that
 
04:22:01.870 --> 04:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
that's a a nuisance and an inconvenience
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
to the people who are doing good work in
 
04:22:06.269 --> 04:22:06.279 align:start position:0%
the state we're preserving some of them
 
04:22:09.429 --> 04:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
for sure but in statute it says that in
 
04:22:12.630 --> 04:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
order for us to change the definition of
 
04:22:16.070 --> 04:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
an amendment to a license we have to get
 
04:22:18.349 --> 04:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
it changed in statute and thus why this
 
04:22:21.710 --> 04:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
is coming before you if you're worried
 
04:22:23.389 --> 04:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
about the 20 to
 
04:22:26.149 --> 04:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
$30,000 um I'll get George russos to
 
04:22:28.070 --> 04:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
take it out of his bonus
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
well well speak funny you mentioned
 
04:22:32.630 --> 04:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
George because um the issue I always
 
04:22:33.630 --> 04:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
thought was the
 
04:22:36.510 --> 04:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
fees uh were to go after people who were
 
04:22:40.189 --> 04:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
not uh going to be part of the
 
04:22:42.830 --> 04:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
assessment now words only domestic are
 
04:22:42.840 --> 04:22:44.429 align:start position:0%
assessment now words only domestic are
getting

04:22:44.429 --> 04:22:44.439 align:start position:0%
getting
 
04:22:47.510 --> 04:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
assessed and so therefore this this
 
04:22:51.149 --> 04:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
these fees are way to make the pain for
 
04:22:53.229 --> 04:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
being a domestic
 
04:22:55.670 --> 04:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
less but if you're telling me it's so
 
04:22:57.269 --> 04:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
little amount of money the domestics
 
04:23:00.109 --> 04:23:00.119 align:start position:0%
don't care yeah it's little it's little
 
04:23:02.750 --> 04:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
make no mistake I think producers across
 
04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
the board are appreciative of the fact
 
04:23:06.830 --> 04:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to inject a little bit
 
04:23:10.389 --> 04:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
of customer friendly common sense into
 
04:23:13.109 --> 04:23:13.119 align:start position:0%
into this process and not charge fees to
 
04:23:15.790 --> 04:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
as I said in some cases really are
 
04:23:19.309 --> 04:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
absurd and just entirely unnecessary and
 
04:23:21.710 --> 04:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
again the staff time that goes into it
 
04:23:24.309 --> 04:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
is a lot and our licensing unit in
 
04:23:26.469 --> 04:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
particular as I think I've told you is
 
04:23:27.990 --> 04:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
undertaking a number of very big
 
04:23:30.429 --> 04:23:30.439 align:start position:0%
projects we're currently reoccuring the
 
04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
vendor that the state that our
 
04:23:33.910 --> 04:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
department has to administer the
 
04:23:36.910 --> 04:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
licensing exam I don't need those guys
 
04:23:38.510 --> 04:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
diverting time and attention away from
 
04:23:40.349 --> 04:23:40.359 align:start position:0%
chasing people around for you know their
 
04:23:42.229 --> 04:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
married name versus their maiden name
 
04:23:44.349 --> 04:23:44.359 align:start position:0%
and and some of the other things that
 
04:23:46.590 --> 04:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
we've identified as being something that
 
04:23:48.630 --> 04:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
would be considered a formal amendment
 
04:23:50.269 --> 04:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
to their license that would then trigger
 
04:23:53.189 --> 04:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
them to have to pay the
 
04:23:57.550 --> 04:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
fee so hopefully that kind of explains
 
04:24:00.030 --> 04:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
that and I think other than that it's
 
04:24:03.790 --> 04:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
just a bunch of changes to the numbering
 
04:24:06.590 --> 04:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
within the statute to account for the
 
04:24:08.710 --> 04:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
other small changes that have been made
 
04:24:12.710 --> 04:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
here have I missed anything big Emily
 
04:24:14.389 --> 04:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
who's way smarter than I am although
 
04:24:16.309 --> 04:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
that's a low Bar says I haven't missed
 
04:24:16.319 --> 04:24:22.670 align:start position:0%
that's a low Bar says I haven't missed
anything

04:24:22.670 --> 04:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:27.590 --> 04:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
important all good any questions anybody
 
04:24:27.600 --> 04:24:29.189 align:start position:0%
important all good any questions anybody
looks

04:24:29.189 --> 04:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
looks
 
04:24:36.189 --> 04:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:39.109 --> 04:24:39.119 align:start position:0%
good anybody else would like to testify
 
04:24:44.910 --> 04:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:49.590 --> 04:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:49.600 --> 04:24:54.830 align:start position:0%
 
hearing

04:24:54.830 --> 04:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:57.469 --> 04:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
okay hey Mike would you tell the you are
 
04:24:59.710 --> 04:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
you headed out the door you tell the
 
04:25:09.870 --> 04:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:47.670 --> 04:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:50.790 --> 04:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
so for the new members of the committee
 
04:25:52.950 --> 04:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
um departments often have these
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
technical Corrections and adjustments um
 
04:25:59.269 --> 04:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
they ask me to sponsor the bill and I I
 
04:26:01.109 --> 04:26:01.119 align:start position:0%
I don't testify because I don't really
 
04:26:03.309 --> 04:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
have any skin in the game about what the
 
04:26:08.030 --> 04:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
bills are about um and but that it's um
 
04:26:11.149 --> 04:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
um that's why this hearing process is a
 
04:26:16.349 --> 04:26:16.359 align:start position:0%
little different than most hearing
 
04:26:21.630 --> 04:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
processes I I would say I would in e in
 
04:26:23.830 --> 04:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
either case I would make sure that I not
 
04:26:26.990 --> 04:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
going to have a hear any Guff about the
 
04:26:28.830 --> 04:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
bill because then it would be that would
 
04:26:31.630 --> 04:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
be problematic that I'm sponsoring the
 
04:26:34.030 --> 04:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
bill and shairing the meeting but uh
 
04:26:35.790 --> 04:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
these are these are departments bills
 
04:26:37.550 --> 04:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
and when they run them by me they seem
 
04:26:39.590 --> 04:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
very benign
 
04:26:41.910 --> 04:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
so and a good thing to the state of New
 
04:26:41.920 --> 04:26:43.630 align:start position:0%
so and a good thing to the state of New
Hampshire

04:26:43.630 --> 04:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire

CFO and to to your point Mr chairman
 
04:27:06.670 --> 04:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what this is this is what
 
04:27:10.149 --> 04:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
we call a housekeeping bill um if you
 
04:27:12.349 --> 04:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
look on page two the organizational
 
04:27:16.229 --> 04:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
structure of the Liquor Commission uh
 
04:27:18.389 --> 04:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
Commission of Office of the commission
 
04:27:20.950 --> 04:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
division of enforcement division of
 
04:27:22.870 --> 04:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
administration and the division of
 
04:27:25.389 --> 04:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
marketing and Merchandising that
 
04:27:28.229 --> 04:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
division of administration is what we
 
04:27:31.349 --> 04:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
called the COO position and we're taking
 
04:27:34.229 --> 04:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
that position and we're um we're
 
04:27:36.750 --> 04:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
attempting to uh make a division of
 
04:27:39.670 --> 04:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
administration and a division of finance
 
04:27:41.870 --> 04:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
this is a recommendation that was given
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
to Us by the LBA a few years ago in one
 
04:27:47.229 --> 04:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
of our audits The Liquor Commission is
 
04:27:50.389 --> 04:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
audited every year by the LBA and this
 
04:27:53.830 --> 04:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
was something that we put on hold until
 
04:27:56.469 --> 04:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
our new nextg system our new back of the
 
04:27:58.590 --> 04:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
house and front of the house system was
 
04:28:02.469 --> 04:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
put into place uh obviously uh you run a
 
04:28:04.510 --> 04:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
business finance is the backbone of
 
04:28:07.469 --> 04:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
every business and uh Tina's done a
 
04:28:09.349 --> 04:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
wonderful job over the years Tina is a
 
04:28:12.109 --> 04:28:12.119 align:start position:0%
30-year employee of the liquor commiss
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
Mission and she's done a wonderful job
 
04:28:18.030 --> 04:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
as CFO running it down on page three
 
04:28:20.910 --> 04:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
we'll look at the new uh outline of of
 
04:28:23.149 --> 04:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
it which would have the office of the
 
04:28:26.070 --> 04:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
commission the division of enforcement
 
04:28:28.590 --> 04:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
and their full-time positions division
 
04:28:31.109 --> 04:28:31.119 align:start position:0%
of administration their full-time
 
04:28:33.710 --> 04:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
positions the division of finance and
 
04:28:34.990 --> 04:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
the division of
 
04:28:37.870 --> 04:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
marketing uh this will be covered within
 
04:28:40.269 --> 04:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
our current operating budget no
 
04:28:42.910 --> 04:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
additional funds will be necessary for
 
04:28:45.670 --> 04:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
us to do this and it will have no impact
 
04:28:47.510 --> 04:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
to our
 
04:28:51.229 --> 04:28:51.239 align:start position:0%

04:29:26.870 --> 04:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
from out of state so with that Mr
 
04:29:28.550 --> 04:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd be happy to answer any
 
04:29:30.670 --> 04:29:30.680 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone may have for
 
04:29:33.670 --> 04:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
either for myself or Tina thank
 
04:29:36.910 --> 04:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
you oh representative
 
04:29:40.070 --> 04:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
spear this is probably a silly question
 
04:29:42.670 --> 04:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
but what is unclassified versus
 
04:29:45.910 --> 04:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
classified mean with respect to people
 
04:29:49.269 --> 04:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
are they it's it's the um type of
 
04:29:51.790 --> 04:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
position so the directors are
 
04:29:54.030 --> 04:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions and then all of
 
04:29:56.830 --> 04:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
the other employees are classified what
 
04:29:58.710 --> 04:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
does the classified mean it's not
 
04:30:00.550 --> 04:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
security I mean whether we can fire them
 
04:30:03.389 --> 04:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
or not it's what at the working at the
 
04:30:03.399 --> 04:30:04.469 align:start position:0%
or not it's what at the working at the
will

04:30:04.469 --> 04:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:30:07.149 --> 04:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
of oh is that what that means it doesn't
 
04:30:13.070 --> 04:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:13.080 --> 04:30:15.950 align:start position:0%
 
maybe

04:30:15.950 --> 04:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:18.990 --> 04:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
ATF but yeah clarent is just basically
 
04:30:22.990 --> 04:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
you know who who can get fired at at
 
04:30:24.950 --> 04:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
will which
 
04:30:28.550 --> 04:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
one which the unclassified positions are
 
04:30:33.510 --> 04:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:36.109 --> 04:30:36.119 align:start position:0%
of okay so that answered your question
 
04:30:37.590 --> 04:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
04:30:40.109 --> 04:30:40.119 align:start position:0%
Kips thank you
 
04:30:43.750 --> 04:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
um just for clarify a isn't classified
 
04:30:45.990 --> 04:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
position similar to in the federal
 
04:30:47.469 --> 04:30:47.479 align:start position:0%
government civil
 
04:30:51.269 --> 04:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
service with the protection yes yes
 
04:30:54.910 --> 04:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um okay my question is um
 
04:30:58.149 --> 04:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
there's a reference to removing uh a
 
04:31:00.309 --> 04:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner position from the list of
 
04:31:03.349 --> 04:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
unclassified employees does that mean
 
04:31:06.349 --> 04:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
getting rid of a position or changing it
 
04:31:08.830 --> 04:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
from unclassified to classified or
 
04:31:11.990 --> 04:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
something else uh representative that
 
04:31:14.510 --> 04:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
position years ago the commission was
 
04:31:18.229 --> 04:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
run by three Commissioners and one acted
 
04:31:22.149 --> 04:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
as the chairman several years ago the
 
04:31:26.510 --> 04:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature changed to one chairman
 
04:31:29.149 --> 04:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
and a Deputy Commissioner and that
 
04:31:31.510 --> 04:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
reference to a commissioner being the
 
04:31:33.389 --> 04:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
third commissioner was something that
 
04:31:36.030 --> 04:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
was just never taken out of the language
 
04:31:38.269 --> 04:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
so that was just a housekeeping piece of
 
04:31:38.279 --> 04:31:39.269 align:start position:0%
so that was just a housekeeping piece of
that

04:31:39.269 --> 04:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:31:42.030 --> 04:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
bill um followup question for the
 
04:31:49.349 --> 04:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:52.389 --> 04:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
uhif sorry um where it says two
 
04:31:54.630 --> 04:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
unclassified and one classified which
 
04:31:56.349 --> 04:31:56.359 align:start position:0%
would be a total of three in fact
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's a total of two one unclassified
 
04:32:01.149 --> 04:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
and one unclassified no uh
 
04:32:03.550 --> 04:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
representative the two unclassified
 
04:32:05.670 --> 04:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
would be myself and the Deputy
 
04:32:07.830 --> 04:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioner and the one classified
 
04:32:10.229 --> 04:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
would be our Administrative Assistant
 
04:32:12.070 --> 04:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
that we share
 
04:32:17.109 --> 04:32:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:19.349 --> 04:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
pleasure that's
 
04:32:21.510 --> 04:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
it in the old
 
04:32:24.750 --> 04:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
days just have to tell a story
 
04:32:28.389 --> 04:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
right in the old days we we had three
 
04:32:29.950 --> 04:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioners because they were really
 
04:32:33.870 --> 04:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
the judges when it came to license
 
04:32:37.389 --> 04:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
suspensions so that for years that was
 
04:32:39.429 --> 04:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
the idea of having three Commissioners
 
04:32:41.469 --> 04:32:41.479 align:start position:0%
and then but only one of them was the
 
04:32:41.479 --> 04:32:43.309 align:start position:0%
and then but only one of them was the
chair

04:32:43.309 --> 04:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:32:44.870 --> 04:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh the other one was supposed to be in
 
04:32:48.590 --> 04:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
charge of uh marketing and the third one
 
04:32:51.269 --> 04:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
was in charge of
 
04:32:54.189 --> 04:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement and uh and then once we
 
04:32:57.910 --> 04:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
changed this the structure and got rid
 
04:33:01.070 --> 04:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
of one one position uh she she retired
 
04:33:03.429 --> 04:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
so it was a window of opportunity for us
 
04:33:06.070 --> 04:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
to do away with the position and that's
 
04:33:10.310 --> 04:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
how we have this the situation we have
 
04:33:12.830 --> 04:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
now thank you very very much Mr chairman
 
04:33:14.990 --> 04:33:15.000 align:start position:0%

I will be doing is is is making a mop up
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
I think I think I've got all I think of
 
04:34:46.869 --> 04:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
all the early bills have already been
 
04:34:50.029 --> 04:34:50.039 align:start position:0%
scheduled we've already um we have we
 
04:34:51.470 --> 04:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
hear them
 
04:34:54.429 --> 04:34:54.439 align:start position:0%
tomorrow but that um I know we have one
 
04:34:57.470 --> 04:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
more ambulance
 
04:35:01.150 --> 04:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
bill okay and this this is the the uh
 
04:35:02.990 --> 04:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
this is the one that's being put forward
 
04:35:05.470 --> 04:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
by the the fire chiefs the one that's
 
04:35:06.869 --> 04:35:06.879 align:start position:0%
got the
 
04:35:10.910 --> 04:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
230% over Medicaid so um before we can
 
04:35:14.269 --> 04:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
take action on the other two and we I
 
04:35:17.109 --> 04:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
want to have all three heard so we will
 
04:35:20.029 --> 04:35:20.039 align:start position:0%
hear that next next
 
04:35:23.269 --> 04:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
Wednesday but then that forces that uh
 
04:35:25.670 --> 04:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
because the ambulance bill needs to get
 
04:35:28.990 --> 04:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
out the following Thursday I mean
 
04:35:32.109 --> 04:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
Wednesday or Tuesday well but Wednesday
 
04:35:33.310 --> 04:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
is for
 
04:35:35.349 --> 04:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
sure um because I never know what
 
04:35:38.830 --> 04:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
committee rooms I can get um so the
 
04:35:42.150 --> 04:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
following Wednesday which is
 
04:35:42.160 --> 04:35:44.789 align:start position:0%
following Wednesday which is
the

04:35:44.789 --> 04:35:44.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:35:50.070 --> 04:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:52.990 --> 04:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
day and which we will take up the
 
04:35:53.000 --> 04:35:54.029 align:start position:0%
day and which we will take up the
ambulance

04:35:54.029 --> 04:35:54.039 align:start position:0%
ambulance
 
04:35:57.429 --> 04:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
bills that and and any other all the
 
04:35:59.470 --> 04:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
early bills I want to I want to have do
 
04:36:01.109 --> 04:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
all the subcommittees on any of the
 
04:36:04.429 --> 04:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
early bills on that 12th so that means
 
04:36:08.109 --> 04:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
then um the
 
04:36:11.789 --> 04:36:11.799 align:start position:0%
19th um will be when we need to exec all
 
04:36:14.551 --> 04:36:14.561 align:start position:0%
the bills that have to be out for March
 
04:36:18.269 --> 04:36:18.279 align:start position:0%
6 because the following week is vacation
 
04:36:22.189 --> 04:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
week that's another Wednesday we do have
 
04:36:26.230 --> 04:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
because we do have a March 5th that if
 
04:36:29.470 --> 04:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
if we don't get all the early bills done
 
04:36:32.310 --> 04:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
and prior to the vacation we can still
 
04:36:38.629 --> 04:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
out I guess I don't need this but when
 
04:36:45.789 --> 04:36:45.799 align:start position:0%
when last we did the um uh ambulance
 
04:36:48.109 --> 04:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
bills the way we left it if I remember
 
04:36:51.070 --> 04:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
correctly was we were going to get the
 
04:36:53.230 --> 04:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
uh the folks that did the analysis to
 
04:36:57.789 --> 04:36:57.799 align:start position:0%
come in yes and the second piece
 
04:37:04.590 --> 04:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
was the Chiefs gave Dr AIS
 
04:37:07.551 --> 04:37:07.561 align:start position:0%
the backup for how they came up with
 
04:37:09.949 --> 04:37:09.959 align:start position:0%
their numbers and he was going to do an
 
04:37:14.349 --> 04:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:16.510 --> 04:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
different so they and they said that
 
04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
they're working on that and they should
 
04:37:21.189 --> 04:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
have the answer for that within the next
 
04:37:22.670 --> 04:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
you know they expected to present it
 
04:37:25.230 --> 04:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
next week but it sounds like they some
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
of this stuff is going to get pushed out
 
04:37:31.349 --> 04:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
right at this point um yeah we're we're
 
04:37:34.269 --> 04:37:34.279 align:start position:0%
we're we're scheduling that not for next
 
04:37:36.189 --> 04:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
week but for the the following week yeah
 
04:37:37.910 --> 04:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
the 12 so we still going to be able to
 
04:37:39.869 --> 04:37:39.879 align:start position:0%
hear from the folks who did the original
 
04:37:42.230 --> 04:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
an actually the reason why is the the
 
04:37:44.551 --> 04:37:44.561 align:start position:0%
consultant that the department uses out
 
04:37:46.750 --> 04:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
of state so that's why I'm confirming
 
04:37:49.070 --> 04:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
that 12th date I've just confirmed that
 
04:37:51.949 --> 04:37:51.959 align:start position:0%
with person if you were wondering what I
 
04:37:53.869 --> 04:37:53.879 align:start position:0%
was doing out in the
 
04:37:56.310 --> 04:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
hallway that's what I was negotiating
 
04:37:58.949 --> 04:37:58.959 align:start position:0%
that date that's good for the consultant
 
04:38:03.789 --> 04:38:03.799 align:start position:0%
yes okay I'm a little unclear okay so
 
04:38:06.789 --> 04:38:06.799 align:start position:0%
Wednesday the 12th Wednesday the 12th we
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
will have subcommittees it will be
 
04:38:12.390 --> 04:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
Insurance the the high profile one will
 
04:38:13.551 --> 04:38:13.561 align:start position:0%
be the
 
04:38:16.230 --> 04:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
insurance subcommittee and which we will
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
definitely be taking up first thing is
 
04:38:19.990 --> 04:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
the ambulance
 
04:38:23.310 --> 04:38:23.320 align:start position:0%
bills and then the 19th you can execute
 
04:38:24.949 --> 04:38:24.959 align:start position:0%

04:38:44.510 --> 04:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's how we got on the short end of
 
04:38:46.390 --> 04:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
the sick because they wanted us to meet
 
04:38:52.070 --> 04:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:56.189 --> 04:38:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:56.199 --> 04:38:58.869 align:start position:0%
 
happen

04:38:58.869 --> 04:38:58.879 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:39:04.551 --> 04:39:04.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:08.510 --> 04:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
morning at n they did but that was when
 
04:39:12.310 --> 04:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
they had a big load we still
 
04:39:13.990 --> 04:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
right well we will you know in terms of
 
04:39:15.629 --> 04:39:15.639 align:start position:0%
this committee we will have our exec
 
04:39:18.551 --> 04:39:18.561 align:start position:0%
session tomorrow and so those bills will
 
04:39:21.990 --> 04:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:24.109 --> 04:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
Thursday when do you expect we'll be
 
04:39:27.869 --> 04:39:27.879 align:start position:0%
done with everything when
 
04:39:31.789 --> 04:39:31.799 align:start position:0%
yeah uh well terms of all 36 bills that
 
04:39:36.470 --> 04:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
are in our committee so um I I will then
 
04:39:38.830 --> 04:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
will say is that pretty quickly we're
 
04:39:41.430 --> 04:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
going to have done all our hearings yeah
 
04:39:45.110 --> 04:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
so like I said the the the first D to
 
04:39:47.990 --> 04:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
iogi was that was that we had uh that
 
04:39:50.030 --> 04:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
Wednesday the 5th we've got to make sure
 
04:39:53.070 --> 04:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
we've exec all the early bills which was
 
04:39:57.550 --> 04:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
about 13 of them and then we'll have the
 
04:40:00.030 --> 04:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
12th the 19 and we have two three weeks
 
04:40:03.430 --> 04:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
that we can get rid of all the rest of
 
04:40:06.190 --> 04:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
them in March in March 20th right so we
 
04:40:07.110 --> 04:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
have two
 
04:40:11.030 --> 04:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
weeks to toh get rid of you know to to
 
04:40:13.470 --> 04:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
do subcommittees and exact everything
 
04:40:16.868 --> 04:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
right so we're we're definitely it's a
 
04:40:18.510 --> 04:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
little lighter than last year last year
 
04:40:20.948 --> 04:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
was a little stressful at the end there
 
04:40:23.628 --> 04:40:23.638 align:start position:0%
um but you know we don't have any of the
 
04:40:26.310 --> 04:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
housing housing bills so that makes it a
 
04:40:26.320 --> 04:40:40.230 align:start position:0%
housing housing bills so that makes it a
lot

04:40:40.230 --> 04:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:40.240 --> 04:41:10.230 align:start position:0%
 
easier

04:41:10.230 --> 04:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:10.240 --> 04:41:40.230 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:41:40.230 --> 04:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:40.240 --> 04:42:10.150 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:42:10.150 --> 04:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:10.160 --> 04:42:40.110 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:42:40.110 --> 04:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:40.120 --> 04:43:10.110 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:43:10.110 --> 04:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:10.120 --> 04:43:40.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:43:40.030 --> 04:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:40.040 --> 04:44:10.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:44:10.030 --> 04:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
