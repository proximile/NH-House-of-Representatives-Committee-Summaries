00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
all right everyone good morning it is
 
00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 align:start position:0%
10:02 we're going to get the 10:01 10
 
00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
o'cl we're going to get the um housing
 
00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
Allegiance I pledge allegiance to the
 
00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
flag of the United States of America to

God indivisible with liy and jti for
 
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
all okay so a couple housekeeping things
 
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
before we get started um there's
 
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
a there's a few new members of the House
 
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
on this committee so um I just wanted to
 
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
refer you to a resource that I use to
 
00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
stay organized as chair but also I feel
 
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
like to help the members stay organized
 
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
this is our committee flowchart so at
 
00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
any point you can pull this online um
 
00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
but you can also pull it from um ask the
 
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee assistant to print copies I
 
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
printed everyone copies of the bills
 
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
that are assigned a committee and what
 
00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
what the status of them are so um that's
 
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
for your reference um to stay organized
 
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
and I found it very helpful for me um
 
00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 align:start position:0%
and then the only other thing is if if
 
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
time allows today uh and we have a full
 
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
committee I may call an executive
 
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
session on a couple bills I've conferred
 
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
with um representative Paige on those
 
00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
bills so um just a heads up there so

Lebanon and it is my privilege to
 
00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 572 to you today the
 
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
partners in housing Bill the program
 
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
proposed here here tackles
 
00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
affordability and what's called The
 
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
Missing middle New Hampshire has no
 
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
shortage of apartment buildings with
 
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
rents starting at $2,000 a month or more
 
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
and we have a growing inventory of
 
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 align:start position:0%
single family homes approaching the 1
 
00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
million Mark and Beyond what we don't
 
00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
have are modestly priced homes that
 
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
local developers can build and Working
 
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
Families can
 
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
afford while we need more homes of all
 
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
kinds we need a substantial portion of
 
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
those homes to be affordable to the
 
00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 align:start position:0%

First Responders and so many
 
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
more we don't have these houses because
 
00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
they don't pencil out for developers the
 
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
cost of land of borrowing of
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
construction and permitting are just too
 
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
high Partners in housing takes aim at
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
these costs in three specific ways first
 
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
by offering a database of Municipal and
 
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
county-owned land suitable for
 
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
development second by providing lowest
 
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
loans or grants to developers who work
 
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
with municipalities to build entry-level
 
00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 align:start position:0%
homes on those sites and third by
 
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 align:start position:0%
Expediting planning Board
 
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
review these mechanisms will save
 
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
developers hundreds of thousands of
 
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.189 align:start position:0%
developers hundreds of thousands of
dollars

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
creating new space for local and
 
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
Regional Builders to compete and new
 
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
incentives to build the homes New
 
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents so badly need HB
 
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
572 provides the investment necessary to
 
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
stand up the program and the legislative
 
00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
framework to make it work all
 
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
Investments have to pay off though and
 
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
in this case New Hampshire will gain a
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
growing stock of Ming Miss Missing
 
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 align:start position:0%

Champions
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
program finally there is nothing
 
00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
mandatory about this program it's a
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
voluntary partnership that towns and
 
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
counties can join if their governing
 
00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 align:start position:0%
bodies see fit to do
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
so in addressing affordability as a key
 
00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
driver of this problem Partners in
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
housing could alter the trajectory of
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
ever increasing home prices and
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing rentals it will make it
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
possible for communities to thrive and
 
00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
businesses to prosper by providing homes
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
that people can reasonably afford I want
 
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
to thank the committee for considering
 
00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 align:start position:0%
this proposal and for its crucial work
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
in finding ways to confront New
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's housing shortage we're
 
00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:14.919 align:start position:0%
confident and optimistic that Partners
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
in housing together with the many other
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
ideas that come before you this term
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
will help pull us out of the truly
 
00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:25.879 align:start position:0%
dangerous situation that we're in I also
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
want to thank all the individuals and
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
organizations who support part Partners
 
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
in housing and whove been with us since
 
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:54.230 align:start position:0%
in housing and whove been with us since
the

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
beginning to um housing really it's any
 
00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that would support
 
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.390 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that would support
housing

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
um the program also um would allow Bea
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
this is one of the other expenses to
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
create a Statewide database that would
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
enable municipalities to participate in
 
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
putting municipally owned land open for
 
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
development on that that would be then
 
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
be available for developers to uh
 
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
research and and Source um and I'd have
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
to look to the drafters to see if there
 
00:08:27.869 --> 00:08:27.879 align:start position:0%
was anything else that um that would be
 
00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
composed of that I just have a quick
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
followup oh um so I I think that ex that
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
explains the grant but in terms of the
 
00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
loan portion of it how much money is
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
being lent out who I guess Bea is
 
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
lending it who is receiving these
 
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
loans so uh it the bill leaves I think
 
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
that a little bit open to be defined
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
through the rules process uh during the
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
housing Champions program we work with
 
00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
the um housing Champions um advisory
 
00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959 align:start position:0%
committee to develop the rules I imagine
 
00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
there would be another process like that
 
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to narrow down the Loan
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
program in the housing champions in
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
invest New Hampshire program last year
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't have enough uh funding in the
 
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
housing Champions program to focus on
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
some of the aspects that were listed in
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
in the legislation and so the rules that
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
we have were really to focus on what we
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
did have money for which was the
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and the per unit so
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
there's also the aspect of technical
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
assistance uh which we funded through
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
basically the HOP program a previous HOP
 
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
program which was federally funded and
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
invest in h and didn't draft uh specific
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
rules to do that so there would be need
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
to be a new uh Ru making process to uh
 
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
provide more detail on those aspects of
 
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.230 align:start position:0%
provide more detail on those aspects of
the

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:47.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
program but the eligible uh recipients
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
are listed uh in the legislation the
 
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.990 align:start position:0%
are listed uh in the legislation the
proposed

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
can can I just ask where in the
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
legislation that's listed just so I can
 
00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:12.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
here the housing Champions program is is
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.310 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:36.279 align:start position:0%
developers building Workforce housing
 
00:10:38.829 --> 00:10:38.839 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
Paige may I answer I'll answer that
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
question under um representative's
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
question there is a portion here where
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
it says grants and Loans may be made by
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
the department to housing developers to
 
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
whom municipality or County pursuant to
 
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:54.200 align:start position:0%
the RC above transfers ownership of the
 
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
municipally or County owned property for
 
00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
the purpose of residential development
 
00:10:59.629 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
where at least 20% of the housing units
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
to be developed will be affordable for a
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
period of at least 20 years so in terms
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
of eligible recipients I think that is
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
that representative Howen I just had a
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
quick one because you mentioned the
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
housing uh opportunity grants and so I
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
think it which I I had asked the
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner before just to give a list
 
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:23.720 align:start position:0%
of all the ordinances that actually got
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
passed during the Housing Opportunity
 
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
grants because I think it's really
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
important for everybody to see it it
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
gives some accountabil ility to show
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
that the money actually did something um
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
under this and specifically because
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to continue to fund the
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
housing Champions is there still some
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
grant money in there to have communities
 
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
who haven't reached the point of housing
 
00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
Champions to to provide them with some
 
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
technical assistance so that they can
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
get to housing
 
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
Champions the Housing Opportunity
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
program there's there I don't believe
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
there any funds left they just went
 
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
through the final round of that uh New
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority um
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
has been managing that program uh that
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
this would provide additional funding
 
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
for technical assistance uh to
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
communities to continue that um and
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
let's see the first part of your
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
question was um I think it was more of a
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
comment actually that I had asked the
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner to provide it it to go out
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
find a list and I know that hop 2 just
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
was this fall but if we could see a list
 
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
of the ordinances that communities
 
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
passed because I I think again we're
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
we're allocated I think there was
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars that was allocated
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
that we can actually see the specific
 
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
ordinances just to give us an idea what
 
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
we got for our money yep we have a we
 
00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
have a list that we could compile for
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
you on that that'd be great if you could
 
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
send that to us yeah we did uh because
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
this does uh connect to the housing
 
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
Champions existing legislation um we did
 
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
and I think commissioner mentioned this
 
00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
at the uh last meeting uh we did uh
 
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
award 18 communities housing Champions
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
and we're now in an open Grant process
 
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
application process for the
 
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and the housing
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
production Grant
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
so okay thank you very much for your
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
Burns good morning Margaret Burns
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
representing the new New Hampshire
 
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and we are here
 
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
this morning in support of House Bill
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
572 establishing the partners in housing
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
program this program builds upon the
 
00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
housing Champions program that already
 
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
exists and it really exemplifies State
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
local partnership in addressing the
 
00:13:47.949 --> 00:13:47.959 align:start position:0%
housing crisis while also empowering
 
00:13:50.749 --> 00:13:50.759 align:start position:0%
local officials and their voters uh to
 
00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
make decisions that are in the best
 
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:55.240 align:start position:0%
interest of the Community nh's member
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
adopted policies are to create more
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
local options and more incentives to
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities to address zoning and to
 
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
take steps to assist in improving
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
housing opportunities in their
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
communities um you've heard a lot of
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
testimony about what the bill does so I
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
don't think I need to repeat that but
 
00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions if
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
anyone has any I will note Mr chairman
 
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
that you had referenced on page one the
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
authority to lease uh property I do read
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
the changes to RSA
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
411a on page one to really just be
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
revisions of already existing Authority
 
00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:34.519 align:start position:0%
not to actually change the authority the
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
governing body has and when I look at
 
00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:41.959 align:start position:0%
page two um section five the partners
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
and housing program and as far as the
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
grants and loans that are available it
 
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
appears that they're available only in
 
00:14:50.749 --> 00:14:50.759 align:start position:0%
circumstances where there's a transfer
 
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
of ownership of the property from the
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
municipality or the county for the
 
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of residential development so I
 
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
don't read this program to also include
 
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
leasing of land for a period of time to
 
00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
be eligible for the grants and Loans but
 
00:15:06.749 --> 00:15:06.759 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly willing to speak with the
 
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:07.959 align:start position:0%
sponsor if that's if I'm
 
00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding that um so I think that
 
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
concludes my testimony I'm happy to take
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
Burns you're off the hook thank
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Bob quinnn I am
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
the CEO of the New Hampshire Association
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
of Realtors and uh we are supportive of
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
anything that's going to increase
 
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
housing inventory in the state um in
 
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
2024 median sale price in New Hampshire
 
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
for a single family home was
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
$514,000 um that was an increase of
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
about 99.3% from the previous year
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
nationally housing prices increased 5%
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
so we were almost twice the national
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
average um and I think inflation CPI was
 
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
about 2.3 so housing prices are
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
increasing at a far greater rate than
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
inflation is here in the state um to
 
00:16:11.949 --> 00:16:11.959 align:start position:0%
underscore that point last week
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
realtor.com uh released a study and
 
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
we've talked about starter homes and the
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
need for starter homes um so a starter
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
home as we Define it is a home which is
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
medium price is half sold above half
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
sold below starter home would be
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
75% above above 25% below since the
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
beginning of covid the starter homes in
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have increased
 
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
88% um the medium price that is the
 
00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:40.839 align:start position:0%
highest of any state in the country
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
according to realtor.com um so the and
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
the definition of what the number is
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
that actual number uh for a starter home
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
$425,000 um so the the the reason for
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
the increasing and the problem with
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
affordability in the state is we just
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't have enough inventory of houses um
 
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
and if you look at permitting over the
 
00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:06.039 align:start position:0%
past 5 Years in New Hampshire you'll see
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
it's relatively flat um estimates are
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
that we need about 20,000 new housing
 
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
units today to meet the demand um and
 
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
that's going to go up to 60,000 I think
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
before 2030 according to the New
 
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority so
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
um obviously there's a need for programs
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
we understand there are a number of
 
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
programs in the state there's uh invest
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing Champions the new
 
00:17:30.909 --> 00:17:30.919 align:start position:0%
uh the affordable housing fund all sort
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
of looking for dollars and there were
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
dwindling dollars in the state um so we
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
are very cognizant of that fact I'll
 
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
leave you I think that ultimately in
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
terms of uh resolving the housing
 
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire we have to
 
00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
expand private property rights um and we
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
need less government regulation in order
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
to do that and with that I'll conclude
 
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
my testimony thank you Mr Quinn
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
questions represent buo um so thank you
 
00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:58.039 align:start position:0%
so much for your testimony um I I was
 
00:17:59.549 --> 00:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
actually really really really uh
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
surprised and shocked that New Hampshire
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
has the the highest starter home price I
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
mean that's really increase or yeah
 
00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:05.799 align:start position:0%
highest increase so that's really a
 
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
wakeup call um in your estimation does
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
uh is does NH have an estimate about how
 
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
many housing units would be needed in
 
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
order to sort of restore balance to our
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
market so right now the estimate and
 
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
this is coming from the New Hampshire
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
Housing Finance Authority it's not our
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
numbers um today if we added 20,000
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
units um that would meet sort of demand
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
in December another metric you can use
 
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
um there is 1.5 months of housing Supply
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh you want six months 6 months is a
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
balanced market so buyers and sellers
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
are sort of on an equal footing um and
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're at 1.5 months so that means that
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
everything that's on the on the market
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
today if nothing else came on the market
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
we would diminish eliminate that Supply
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
within six weeks um that is remarkably
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
low uh nationally it's about even though
 
00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
there's a housing Supply nationally it's
 
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
that follow up yep can I have a followup
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
um so another question is the existing
 
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
housing Supply that we have do you have
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
sort of an estimation of you know when
 
00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
that housing was built and who built it
 
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
like was it private developers was it a
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
government program and kind of what
 
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
decades was was most of the housing
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
inventory in I don't have that off top
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
of my head but I do know that
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:29.799 align:start position:0%
exist right any other questions thank
 
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:33.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr Quinn thank you Ivy
 
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
Honorable good morning committee members
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
I'm Ivy van um I am a certif land use
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
planner uh nationally I work all over
 
00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:03.799 align:start position:0%
the United States and I've been working
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
in New England um and I've been doing a
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
lot of work in New Hampshire through the
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
Housing Opportunity planning grant
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
program I've worked with probably a
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
dozen towns of varying sizes as small as
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
Sullivan which I think is 652 people uh
 
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.110 align:start position:0%
Sullivan which I think is 652 people uh
up

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
through uh Lebanon which is I'm not sure
 
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
how how many people Lebanon has but it's
 
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
way bigger in any case I'm here to
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
support this bill uh I wanted to talk a
 
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
little bit about why a bill like this is
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
really important particularly for small
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
developers in one of my other jobs I am
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
a faculty member for the incremental
 
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
development Alliance which is a
 
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
501c3 that works Nationwide to help
 
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
people become small developers in their
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
own places increasing their own net
 
00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
worth and improving their place
 
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:03.039 align:start position:0%
by providing more housing and getting
 
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
you know buildings that are not on the
 
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
tax rolls back on the tax rolls one of
 
00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
the things that we see all the time
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
everywhere is that uh it's very
 
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
difficult to make construction pencil
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
the rubric that we use is that if you're
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
looking at rental prices for every
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
dollar that you can realistically expect
 
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
to get in rent from a property you
 
00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
cannot put more than
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
$100 into creating that unit because if
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
you do you are an ex developer if you
 
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
used your own money you're you know now
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
you're in the hole if you borrowed the
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
money from your brother-in-law he's not
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
speaking to you anymore if you tried to
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
get it from the bank they laughed at you
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
so anything that we can do that will
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
bring down the cost of creating that
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
unit either by providing land that
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
belongs to the to the town or city or by
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
providing grants for the creation of
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
those units is a help so for example if
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
uh construction prices in the in New
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right now are running
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 3 and a/4 and 375 a
 
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
square foot that's 37 $25 a square foot
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
I am so old that I remember when that
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
number was
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
52 uh so if you run the numbers if I'm
 
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
trying to build a small unit so suppose
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to build one of those
 
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
cottages and lebanon's cottage courts
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm building a 900 square ft two bed
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
two bath unit or even one bath unit I am
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
going to be expending just on the
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
construction something close to
 
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
$300,000 so I might be able to sell it
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
but I sure can't rent it at
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
$33,000 a month and that's what it works
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
out to so anything like this that will
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
allow uh bringing down that initial
 
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
Capital outlay so that sale and rental
 
00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:26.919 align:start position:0%
prices can be lower going forward is a
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
huge help the thing I'd like to say is
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
that I think we sometimes forget that
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
missing middle is a building typology
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
not a price point um and and we need to
 
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
be aware that that's the case that what
 
00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here is house-sized
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
multifamilies which will fit into
 
00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:50.510 align:start position:0%
multifamilies which will fit into
existing

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods um I worked on the Lebanon
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
pattern Zone project and we were very
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
careful about the way we did the survey
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
to see what will fit in these
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods so I would like to urge
 
00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
the committee to support this bill and
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
see it through and I'm happy to take any
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you other questions from
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
Miss fan represent buolo yeah I have a
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you everyone
 
00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
for bearing with me because I have so
 
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
many questions because this is such an
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
important uh topic so you mentioned uh
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
300 uh you know uh cost of over $300 a
 
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
square foot for construction yep um what
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
are the major factors that have driven
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
those costs so high what is what is
 
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
causing that to be so high land labor
 
00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.430 align:start position:0%
causing that to be so high land labor
Lumber

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
laws Lumber is expensive likely to get
 
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
more expensive in the immediate future
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough labor in New
 
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're short on
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
subcontractors uh that is also likely to
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
become more difficult uh yeah and of
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
course uh local zoning laws that require
 
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
large lots and have minimum square
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
footages uh those also and parking which
 
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
I'll be back to talk to you later today
 
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
about is also part of what drives
 
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
it okay and and my followup with this
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
with this currently proposed bill um
 
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
which of those factors does this bill
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
most strongly address because one of the
 
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
things that I'm just caught up on is you
 
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
know the $10 million if that is let's
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
just say loaned out at below Market
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
rates for developers because it'd be too
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
risky for a bank they'd laugh at you
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
like you said apparently you know the
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayer could make that risk but that
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
$10 million if we Factor it out based on
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
construction cost we could build maybe
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
27 of these 900 foot Cottages so that's
 
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
for $10 million we get 27 units and we
 
00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.029 align:start position:0%
for $10 million we get 27 units and we
need

00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:48.039 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:51.559 align:start position:0%
23,000 right well all housing is housing
 
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing to remember is that
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
this also allows for the use of of um
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
municipal owned land so that's a big
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
that's it right there in my town right
 
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
now a lot in town with water and sewer
 
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
is going for about
 
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
$150,000 um so if we can eliminate the
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
cost of land that's a big step in the
 
00:26:17.549 --> 00:26:17.559 align:start position:0%
right direction so and also the fact
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
that it streamlines the process of
 
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
approval for these projects is a huge
 
00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
help if I've borrowed money from the
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
bank to build a thing I'm paying for
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
that money every month and the longer
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
that you make me wait to do the building
 
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm trying to do the more expensive
 
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
is you bet all right thank you very much

begin

00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%

for giving me your time and attention
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
ition we are at a crisis point we need
 
00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
23,000 uh housing units immediately not
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
tomorrow not next year not 5 years we
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
need it now that's what it would take to
 
00:33:15.149 --> 00:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
meet the current need at the same time
 
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
the number of unhoused individuals and
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
families continue to grow in much of the
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
country but particularly here in New
 
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are setting Grim records
 
00:33:26.629 --> 00:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
year over-ear in order to address this
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
we've deployed a variety of helpful
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
programs to facilitate the creation of
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
housing units in all forms um including
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units however there's
 
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
a discrepancy when it comes to
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
incentives while we invest in programs
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
to incentivize larger scale development
 
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
we do not do the same for accessory
 
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.070 align:start position:0%
we do not do the same for accessory
dwelling

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
dwelling
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
units adus are particularly helpful
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
housing options to a wide variety of our
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
residents empty nesters looking to
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
downsize college kids uh young adults
 
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
just starting out in careers folks in
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
the disability community and older folks
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
living on a f fixed income creating an
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
Adu can also provide stability for
 
00:34:05.789 --> 00:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
individuals and families who currently
 
00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
own a home but are having difficulty
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
keeping up with Rising
 
00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
costs I think we can all agree that it
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
would be better for those securely
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
housed to be able to stay in their homes
 
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
and in their Community if they if they
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
so choose in fact the prospect of adding
 
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
housing stock in this way has many
 
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
benefits for many people the lower
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
income homeowner the renter the
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
municipality local businesses and
 
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
contractors to name a few in my research
 
00:34:35.069 --> 00:34:35.079 align:start position:0%
and experience both personally and
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
working with others in the madn region I
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
have found that accessory dwelling units
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
are often the only plausible solution of
 
00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:43.720 align:start position:0%
housing needs in rural communities and
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
small towns whether where neither the
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
need or desire for larger Pro projects
 
00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:52.839 align:start position:0%
exists sure a 2 to four unit um duplex
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
or or a town home may sound like a good
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
solution in theory but it is not
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
economically appealing to a developer in
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
reality in this context adus are perfect
 
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:05.720 align:start position:0%
in some larger cities and towns the need
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
for affordable housing may be present
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
but land is at a premium and in order
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
for a developer to make profit they need
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
to build bigger and charge higher rents
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
adus are a great way to bolster uh an
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
increase in housing there while the
 
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
benefits of Adu creation is understood
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
and many people would like to create one
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
or maybe even more depending on their
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
local ordinances uh The Upfront costs
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
are clearly
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
prohibitive so let's talk about the
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
potential solution that I'm
 
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
proposing this bill sets out to provide
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
a structure for a program that would
 
00:35:40.589 --> 00:35:40.599 align:start position:0%
help bring the cost down specifically
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
for lower income homeowners so that we
 
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
are adding you units to satisfy the
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
overwhelming need but we're also uh
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
preventing housed individuals and
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
families from losing their own
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
stability the program would re would
 
00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
require uh rent for the these units to
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
be at or below the affordable threshold
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
a descriptor a descriptor that only
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
applies to 133% of the current housing
 
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
stock in New Hampshire to put this in
 
00:36:10.589 --> 00:36:10.599 align:start position:0%
context in chesher County the best
 
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
County just saying um 30% housing cost
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
for a single person making 80% of the
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
Ami would translate to $1,400 a month
 
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.390 align:start position:0%
Ami would translate to $1,400 a month
including

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
utilities it doesn't exist this would be
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
the required rent cap on any accelerated
 
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh accessory dwelling units created by
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
participants in this program now I think
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
um I need to address the fiscal note on
 
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
this one so I will I think it's a little
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
presumptuous um in uh flawed in a couple
 
00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
of ways so just to clarify uh I'd like
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
to provide a little bit of context
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units vary widely
 
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
there are detached adus which is very
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
which very simply do not share a wall uh
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
with the main home these can be built
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
new or be renovated and repurposed
 
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
existing structures a garage or a barn
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
for example then there are attached adus
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
possibly one of uh many styles of
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
addition or an attached garage for
 
00:37:11.309 --> 00:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
example or a unit above the garage they
 
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
could even incorporate existing space
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
that is sectioned off in order to uh add
 
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
space to accommodate a full attached
 
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
unit considering the vast differences in
 
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
the types of projects we're talking
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
about here I'm really confused at the
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
numbers we're starting with take for
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
example the difference between
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
converting an attached garage with a
 
00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
shared wet wall and building an entirely
 
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
new building the cost of each project
 
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
varies as widely as the project itself
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
and I've spoken with a handful of
 
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
contractors and Builders and frankly
 
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
these numbers are shocking to
 
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
them further it is not my intention here
 
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
to necessarily finance an entire project
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
but to make projects like this feasible
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
we understand this in terms of
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
development and in fact we accommodate
 
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.200 align:start position:0%
it but in that context we don't get 100%
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
affordable units we usually get
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
something like 20% that simply does not
 
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
meet the need so I'm trying to bring
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
forward forward a proposal that would so
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
let's take a minute and think about what
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
this may look like in practice according
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire fiscal fiscal
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
policy Institute home values have
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
increased by 66% in The Last 5 Years
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
forgive me for the all the numbers I'm
 
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
about to say a homer a homeowner um owes
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
$11,000 on their home after paying it
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
paying for a few years but the value of
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
that home has risen by $50,000 above
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
what they paid given a decent credit
 
00:38:38.109 --> 00:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
home uh a credit history um this
 
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
homeowner could leverage their
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
investment to access a home equity loan
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
and they'd be looking at a monthly
 
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
payment of about $630 a month based on
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
8.75 interest rate is what we're at
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
right now over the course of 10 years at
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
that rate this homeowner could ensure
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
that by renting the unit even at an
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
affordable rate they could cover loan
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
payments set aside a little for
 
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
emergencies and still have money to make
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
ends meet but if the contractor quotes
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
100K for the unit that's no longer
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
feasible if this person is willing but
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
if this person is willing to rent the
 
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
unit at an affordable monthly rate for
 
00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:15.079 align:start position:0%
that same 10 years and their income
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
falls into the lower income category
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
they would qualify for a $50,000
 
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:23.079 align:start position:0%
forgivable loan under this
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
program what I've laid out here are
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
parameters for a program that would help
 
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
folks stay in their home and provide
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
100% affordable housing units for
 
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
renters as they say the devil's in the
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
details but for goodness sake we need to
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
think outside the box if we are actually
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
going to meet the need that we face this
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
seemed to me like a pretty good place to
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
start thank you thank you representative
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
are questions for representative
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
new representative Howen so when you
 
00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
envision like the The Loan program would
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
you uh have more of a sliding scale so
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
in other words you said this to qualify
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
you had to have 80% it had to be 80% or
 
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
below Ami for rental but if I'm building
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
a an Adu and I come in and say I'm going
 
00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:09.079 align:start position:0%
to have my rent at 40% of Ami would in
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
this forg loan forgiveness program would
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
you give more money to someone like that
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
to be a higher need no it's specifically
 
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
to be rented as what is considered
 
00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
affordable and the way that we do that
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
it it comes from HUD so it's 80% of um
 
00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
Ami for that area around here it's by
 
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
County that's why I talk talked about
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know the best Mon chure and um and
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
so it would be 30% of that is what is
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
considered affordable so they would have
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
to charge that 30% that's yeah yeah yes
 
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
I know it's a throwing some numbers
 
00:40:46.349 --> 00:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
thing um so I have a question regarding
 
00:40:53.309 --> 00:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
the Forgiveness part of it would would
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
you consider instead of doing is it a
 
00:40:56.589 --> 00:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
complete forgiveness of the loan you
 
00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
would consider or something where the
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
they would offer it at a at a lower
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
interest rate I guess I'm I'm wondering
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
about the state's ability to recoup some
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
of the cost of this so it's not just a
 
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
handout and it shall be forgiven but you
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
know maybe they can create like a
 
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
revolving fund for this sort of thing um
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
where they can slowly you know build up
 
00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:16.839 align:start position:0%
the fund I guess I'm wondering what what
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on that is I think um I
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
think anything that we do will be
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
helpful number one I'll just put it like
 
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
that anything that we do to be able to
 
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
make it more affordable I think will be
 
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
helpful but what I hit envisioned with
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
this is to say for example you factor
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
out a you know a 20-year um repayment
 
00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
plan right if you do this for 10 years
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
you've satisfied it and your loan will
 
00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
be forgiven or um if it's combined with
 
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
something else you can defer the
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
payments so I I think there are a
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
variety of ways we can go about it this
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
is why I say about the devil in the
 
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
details I think I'm really trying to
 
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
provide a structure and a goal and then
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
hopefully be able to work with folks to
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
figure out exactly what that would look
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
like and still be um yeah helpful thank
 
00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
you represent re thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony is I have a
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
followup after this is it fair to say
 
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
that not only would something like this
 
00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
uh incentivize people to build
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
affordable housing which we desperately
 
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
need that missing mle that we previously
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
talked about but actually in that
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
process because we're helping them
 
00:42:24.549 --> 00:42:24.559 align:start position:0%
generate a revenue source for themselves
 
00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
we're helping lift that lower um LMI
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
population I guess it might just be 80%
 
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:33.640 align:start position:0%
might be just lowincome population up
 
00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
isn't that accurate absolutely uh am I
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
followup yep thank you uh were you aware
 
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
per the chair's comments just now about
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
a revolving fund that there was a bill
 
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
last year um that would have created a
 
00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:51.559 align:start position:0%
loan program that was self- sustaining
 
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
um to help people uh purchase uh
 
00:42:58.829 --> 00:42:58.839 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and that type of
 
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
program in that bill might fit in well
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
with this um because if a private
 
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
institution can make money lending out
 
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
loans for people to have housing then
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
why can't the state do that at um at
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
Cost I
 
00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
agree great other questions for
 
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you once again for the opportunity
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
to speak um we've looked at this one and
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
actually don't have an opinion for our
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
against there's as we read through it we
 
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
see some pros and cons so I just want to
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
mention those and there are some
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
technical things that uh I see as an
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
issue with the way that some of the
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
language is written um certainly it
 
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
would be a benefit to have more housing
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
and we're all for creation of more
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
housing so incentivizing that is a good
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
idea there are some in our membership
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
that think that it's um too much of a
 
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
cost for the state the taxpayers to pay
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
through the state to benefit a few
 
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
individuals I'm not saying that's my
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
opinion there's just varying thoughts on
 
00:44:23.549 --> 00:44:23.559 align:start position:0%
that there's I think a very troubling
 
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
piece of the way that this is written if
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
you look at line page one line 24 it
 
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
just talks about the ability to forgive
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
the loan and to forgive the loan it
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
would have to be
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
rented at the affordable lower income
 
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
household rates for the duration of the
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
loan term so the way it's written it
 
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
sounds like someone's renting that
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
property they lose their
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
income or their incomes greatly reduced
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
well to keep the the Forgiveness piece
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
here then you'd have to lower the rent
 
00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
to whatever their existing income is
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
now so it would make it totally
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
unworkable the way that that's written
 
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
you could you could write it in another
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
way that the lease you know was it was
 
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
rented at the start of the lease and
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
then whatever happens well that that's
 
00:45:22.349 --> 00:45:22.359 align:start position:0%
the way life happens but the way that's
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
written you know like someone could
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
totally lose their income U be existing
 
00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:29.559 align:start position:0%
on benefits and support and the rent
 
00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
would have to be brought to zero or some
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
extremely low number just to keep the
 
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
Forgiveness portion
 
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
page um anyway it talks about the loan
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
term this would have to be kept for the
 
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
loan term but the loan term is not
 
00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.510 align:start position:0%
loan term but the loan term is not
defined

00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
defined
 
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know what that
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
means so something needs I would think
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
something would need to be done to
 
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
Define what that loan term would be um
 
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
that's my only comments I'd be happy to
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you
 
00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.549 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you
representative

representative
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
for coming in to testify this morning in
 
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
regard to the possibility of a tenant
 
00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
losing their income and then the rate uh
 
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
the rent rate being based on that income
 
00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:28.839 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't the the calculation of
 
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:31.640 align:start position:0%
affordability based on the HUD
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
definition of affordability and the HUD
 
00:46:37.549 --> 00:46:37.559 align:start position:0%
definition of lower income households
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
which is 80% of the Ami for the county
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
not it isn't it not based on the
 
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
individual tenants income but rather on
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
that 80% of
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
Ami I see your point i' have to think
 
00:46:57.069 --> 00:46:57.079 align:start position:0%
about that that that that might answer
 
00:46:57.079 --> 00:46:58.589 align:start position:0%
about that that that that might answer
the

00:46:58.589 --> 00:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you

represent Sullivan County District 8
 
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
towns of aworth Langdon lemster Goan

Washington Springfield sunap my hometown
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
of Cen and the City of Claremont where
 
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of Need for affordable
 
00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
housing and a largely over the
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
district very modest socioeconomic
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
status there are many folks who could
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
benefit from this creative
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
bill um and I would comment with a
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
cliche um this to me is is like the give
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
a man a fish or teach them how to fish
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
help somebody have Revenue to stay in
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
their home and they will continue to be
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
able to be there and be a property
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and in many cases a person
 
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
working in our business economy that we
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
very much need those employees
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
especially Sullivan County is growing we
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
have increasing need in industry and we
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
want people to be able to live
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
there um I want to just mention a very
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
recent I think it was a couple days ago
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
note from a
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
constituent who said
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
essentially my wife and I have two um
 
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
upper middle
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
inome uh professional positions we have
 
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
saved a sizable down payment and we are
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
$100,000 under budget for any home we
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
can find to buy anywhere near where we
 
00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
work in Sullivan
 
00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
County if they were able to purchase a
 
00:48:58.109 --> 00:48:58.119 align:start position:0%
property and put an Adu in they could
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
have rental income to subsidize their
 
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
mortgage and they are not unique in that
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
um the other point that I would make is
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
I want to reinforce represent of n's
 
00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:10.839 align:start position:0%
introductory remarks regarding the
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
variation cost to create
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
adus so as the spouse of a longtime
 
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
residential building contractor who
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
mostly did Renovations and
 
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
remodeling uh often on old or older
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
homes I kind of have a personal resource
 
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
on approaches to construction and ways
 
00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
to mitigate costs and as I talked with
 
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
George about this bill and said you know
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
in this market Labor's expensive
 
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
materials are expensive would it really
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
cost this much on average for an
 
00:49:45.309 --> 00:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
Adu his perspective was very much not
 
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily depends on all the Myriad of
 
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
decisions that you make in both the
 
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
design process and what you do there are
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of ways to reduce costs um for
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
example putting a bathroom and a kitchen
 
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
very close to the existing Plumbing is a
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
whole lot less expensive than if you put
 
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:04.839 align:start position:0%
it on the other side of your mod size
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
Adu and you've got a lot more work to do
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
and a lot uh more material cost um great
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
variation in the cost of cabinets Etc I
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
will not take the committee's time
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
itemizing that but I think that
 
00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
homeowners who are interested in doing
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
this could certainly get good quality
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
advice to help them do it for more like
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
$100,000 if it's within the existing
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
building um so I would very much
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to reinterpret
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note with a range of costs
 
00:50:35.789 --> 00:50:35.799 align:start position:0%
for creating
 
00:50:39.309 --> 00:50:39.319 align:start position:0%
adus um and I will just State my strong
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
support and then I will Boogie Back to
 
00:50:42.789 --> 00:50:42.799 align:start position:0%
education funding committee where we are
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how to lower
 
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:44.910 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how to lower
property

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
taxes well thank you for doing that um
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative Damon
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
Sean thank you have a good day you as
 
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chair members of the
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Jack rudderman with New
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing I am our energy and
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
advisor um I want to start out by saying
 
00:51:20.589 --> 00:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
we are very bullish on
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
adus our job is to fill the housing Gap
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and that's going to
 
00:51:26.319 --> 00:51:27.589 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and that's going to
take

00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
um a variety of solutions there's no
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
single you know no Silver Bullet um it's
 
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
the old silver Buckshot um and so adus
 
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
are one of our top three legislative
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
priorities the session um we have
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
commissioned studies on adus we have
 
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
produced fact sheets on adus we have
 
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
convened conferences uh on
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
adus so we are very much in favor of a
 
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
meure um that will increase the ability
 
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
of um of folks uh in existing homes um
 
00:52:08.589 --> 00:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
to create adus or uh folks who may maybe
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
want to downsize and live in an Adu next
 
00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:15.559 align:start position:0%
to family members house for instance um
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
on the issue of construction
 
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
costs our numbers were based on the
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
assumption that you would be creating a
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
freestanding detached unit or new
 
00:52:32.589 --> 00:52:32.599 align:start position:0%
construction attached unit um as IV van
 
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
testified construction prices are
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
insanely High um
 
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
and she noted that prices right now um
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
range from 325 to
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
$375 per square foot um for our purposes
 
00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
we estimated 275 to 300 per square foot
 
00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.309 align:start position:0%
we estimated 275 to 300 per square foot
um

00:52:57.309 --> 00:52:57.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
putting together a a new Adu is a very
 
00:53:05.069 --> 00:53:05.079 align:start position:0%
costly Endeavor and uh we stand by our
 
00:53:07.349 --> 00:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
estimate of a new freestanding unit
 
00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:10.839 align:start position:0%
costing 275,000 to 300,000 and I think
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
in some ways that may actually be a
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
little bit conservative however the
 
00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
point that not all adus fit that mold uh
 
00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
is well taken and yes you could have a
 
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
garage uh and you just need to put a
 
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
bedroom uh kitchen at um and plumbing um
 
00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
above that unit and sure that might cost
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
100,000 so um I would you know readily
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
acknowledge um that we picked one data
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
point and it probably is a better idea
 
00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
to use a variety of data points um
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
so the cost could be 100,000 I would say
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
to 300
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
325,000 depending on the type of Adu and
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
choices that are made but I will say
 
00:54:05.069 --> 00:54:05.079 align:start position:0%
that you know choices such as you know
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
cabinets and going with something less
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
expensive like Ikea like folks are
 
00:54:11.789 --> 00:54:11.799 align:start position:0%
already doing that um people aren't
 
00:54:14.589 --> 00:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
building luxury adus as as far as we
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
know um so uh again we support having a
 
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
program like this it's important to note
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
as the chair did um that the way this
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
bill is written this is essentially a
 
00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
great program um and the funding for
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
that has to come from somewhere um so
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
the the suggestion that perhaps it be a
 
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
revolving Loan Fund I think is something
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
we would be um very open to and with
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Rudman represent bolo I
 
00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
have a question so um yeah thank you for
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
your testimony and um I I agree with you
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
Adu is being part of you know one of the
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
things that New Hampshire can do to
 
00:54:57.069 --> 00:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
really help solve our housing crisis
 
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
um in terms of uh impediments to
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
building adus what do you think would be
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
maybe the most effective strategy what
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
would be the one thing that you know the
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
legislature could do to increase the
 
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
adus uh that would be a bill um
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
loosening some of the restrictions on
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
adus and there is such a bill that the
 
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
chairman uh is a sponsor of um that this
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
committee I'm sure will be
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
hearing um and it's you know a pretty
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
Broad and comprehensive Bill basically
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the Adu law that was passed
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
eight or 10 years ago which was
 
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
something we actually were very
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
supportive of and and helped um draft um
 
00:55:45.549 --> 00:55:45.559 align:start position:0%
so I think a new bill saying okay it's
 
00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
been eight years or 10 years um let's
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
allow detached units by right um not by
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
special exception um and let's let
 
00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
everybody as a right have one Adu
 
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's attached or detached uh and
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
and various other sort of technical
 
00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
fixes um and things to um just make the
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
process easier so we're very much
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
priority all right thank you for your
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.789 --> 00:56:39.799 align:start position:0%
Stephanie Skyler still with AARP and uh
 
00:56:41.549 --> 00:56:41.559 align:start position:0%
we support HB
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
604 um once again I'll just talk about
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
the highlights since I'm passing around
 
00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:49.240 align:start position:0%
U my written testimony and we believe
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
adus pay a critical role in addressing
 
00:56:53.789 --> 00:56:53.799 align:start position:0%
housing affordability and promoting
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
Community well-being by allowing low
 
00:56:58.270 --> 00:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
income homeowners to create additional
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
Living Spaces in the property this bill
 
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
would support family caregivers ad adus
 
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
are a vital tool for unpaid family
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
caregivers who often need flexible
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
nearby Housing Solutions to care for
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
aging parents relatives with
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities or loved ones recovering
 
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
from illness the ability to build or
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
renovate an Adu enables caregivers to
 
00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
provide highquality close proximity care
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
without significantly dis disrupting
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
lives adus also facilitate Aging in
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
place many older adults wish to remain
 
00:57:37.029 --> 00:57:37.039 align:start position:0%
in their communities as they age adus
 
00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
provide an ideal Solution by allowing
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
seniors to downsize while staying close
 
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
to their families and familiar
 
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods renovating existing
 
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
structures into adus can also ensure
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
more accessibility and safety helping
 
00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:52.839 align:start position:0%
older adults maintain their independence
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
for as long as
 
00:57:57.789 --> 00:57:57.799 align:start position:0%
possible a us also strengthen
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
intergenerational living they promote
 
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
Arrangements where family members can
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
live together or nearby while
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
maintaining their privacy the
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
arrangement supports stronger family
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
bonds and enhances emotional and
 
00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:12.750 align:start position:0%
bonds and enhances emotional and
financial

00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
financial
 
00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:15.640 align:start position:0%
stability and another thing adus do is
 
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
expand affordable housing options adus
 
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
provide an opportunity for homeowners to
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
generate supplemental income through
 
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
rentals while simultaneously offering
 
00:58:27.069 --> 00:58:27.079 align:start position:0%
affordable housing options to

housing Supply particularly in areas
 
00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
with limited affordable housing options
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
adus help address Workforce housing
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
shortages and Foster vibrant sustainable
 
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
communities for these reasons and so
 
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
many others ad um AARP supports this
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you Miss Skyler for

00:58:53.119 --> 00:58:53.750 align:start position:0%
your testimony any questions seeing none
thank

00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
van good morning again committee I'm
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
still iiv van I'm still a planner uh one
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
thing that I was thinking about when I
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
was listening to the testimony on this
 
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
bill and the question about you know is
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
this really a gr program is I would urge
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
the uh drafters and the committee as you
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
think about working on this bill to take
 
00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:31.720 align:start position:0%
a look at Millar Vermont's program for
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units um I think the
 
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
planner and Miller is Michael Miller I
 
00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
think he's still the planner uh Miller
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
put together a program
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
probably was before the pandemic so
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
probably five years ago where they
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
appropriated you know a half a million
 
00:59:53.029 --> 00:59:53.039 align:start position:0%
dollars at town meeting and put it into
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
a revolving Loan Fund for this very
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
purpose for the for creating accessory
 
01:00:01.069 --> 01:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
dwelling units and one of the ways that
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
they structured it is that if the
 
01:00:06.029 --> 01:00:06.039 align:start position:0%
property were sold at the time of the
 
01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
sale the loan would be repaid so that
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
might be a model that would be worth
 
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
looking at um otherwise I'd say that
 
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
anything that gets adus built is a good
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
thing um they're not the cheapest
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
solution but they are a very good
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
solution I would be cautious about
 
01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
structuring this in such a way that the
 
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
homeowner doesn't really realize any
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
benefit from the Adu in terms of
 
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
financial recompense um one of the
 
01:00:40.109 --> 01:00:40.119 align:start position:0%
things I see a lot as a planner working
 
01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
in New England is that we've got a lot
 
01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
of little old ladies and I can say that
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
because I am one um we've got a lot of
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
little old ladies living in houses that
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
are way too big for them and they you
 
01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
know they can't keep paining on the
 
01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
house they can barely pay the taxes if
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
they put it in Adu they need to get some
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
of the benefit of that money um of that
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
of that action so those are things that
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
I'd like to offer the committee as they
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
think about this project going forward
 
01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to get more housing
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
units built is worth doing housing is
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
housing thanks happy to take any
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
questions uh so miss van you're you're
 
01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
talking about specifically removing
 
01:01:27.549 --> 01:01:27.559 align:start position:0%
the a Ami determinants and all that
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
stuff and just creating a a revolving
 
01:01:34.349 --> 01:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
fund creating a revolving fund and um I
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
would so the whole a right now Workforce
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
housing is 60% of Ami area median income
 
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
um if you said that I what I'd like to
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
see avoided is that the homeowner
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't get anything so that uh if
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
they're if they're renting at let's
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
think about numbers here so suppose they
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
get a loan for $100,000 to build this
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
and they are renting it out at 80% of
 
01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:10.279 align:start position:0%
Ami which is low
 
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
income um they should be able
 
01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
to they should be able to keep some of
 
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
that money do you see so that they're
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
not just providing this for
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
nothing and I I guess what you're saying
 
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
is it it ties their hands if they're
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
being told they can only rent at a
 
01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
certain exactly I think you should put a
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
top on it but I think that top should be
 
01:02:37.269 --> 01:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
high enough so that they actually
 
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
generate some income from it because
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise why would you do this I mean
 
01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.950 align:start position:0%
otherwise why would you do this I mean
um

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
yeah it is not without personal cost to
 
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
do thank you okay thanks so much thank
 
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:52.279 align:start position:0%
you is there any is there anyone else
 
01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
that wish to testify on HB 604
 
01:02:57.789 --> 01:02:57.799 align:start position:0%
seeing now I'm going to close the public

01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to call the housing
 
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
committee back to order we're going to
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
go into executive session um the first
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
bill on the agenda that I'd like to exec
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
is House Bill
 
01:17:40.629 --> 01:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
65 um I will entertain myself for a
 
01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
motion who will move that we retain
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
House Bill 65 is there a
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
second second by representative miles um
 
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
just to talk about this a little bit um
 
01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
I I think when we heard during public
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
testimony there isn't Broad disagreement
 
01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
that there's no good merits to the bill
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
I think there's things that we can work
 
01:18:01.149 --> 01:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
on as a committee I think it will
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
require um some time over the summer to
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
do that and you know if we decide in the
 
01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
summer that we can't get to a consensus
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
or we can't figure it out then we have
 
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
options next fall but I think I want to
 
01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
give the time to this bill that it
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
deserves and we can retain it over the
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
summer get some hopefully get some good
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
work done by partisan work and U move
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
forward but I think the bill as written
 
01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:23.510 align:start position:0%
forward but I think the bill as written
is

01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
unworkable any other discussion on
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
that um IO I would just second those
 
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
comments the other thing I would think
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
that would make sense to retain this
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
bill is there's also as I understand the
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh justice department um had a
 
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
settlement um with a couple major
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
commercial landlords uh throughout the
 
01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
country and the Crux of that was they
 
01:18:45.790 --> 01:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
were all sharing information about what
 
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
different rents were being charged so
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
maybe also give it some time to see what
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
that other discussion on that
 
01:18:58.110 --> 01:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
representative Paige I support this
 
01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
approach um and I just want to share
 
01:19:02.189 --> 01:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
with my caucus that I I did have a good
 
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
chat with the sponsor who's also in
 
01:19:07.390 --> 01:19:07.400 align:start position:0%
agreement this is a desirable way to
 
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
go okay anything else all right um the
 
01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:13.880 align:start position:0%

on this cuz it's still in the
 
01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
committee's hands so this will not go on
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
the floor for a vote um this is going to
 
01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
be in the committee's hands throughout
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
the summer um the next bill on the list
 
01:20:35.149 --> 01:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
I'd like to pull up is House Bill 60 and
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
I will um call on representative baxton
 
01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
for a motion uh I move that we move this
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
bill forward with an ought to pass ought
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
to pass by representative Daxton is
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
there a second I'll second
 
01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
representative Dumont seconds it um
 
01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
representative Daxton would you like to
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
speak to your
 
01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
motion I think that this bill has passed
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
the house on several occasions I think
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
it's a sound bill and I think that it uh
 
01:21:03.629 --> 01:21:03.639 align:start position:0%
Works to expand the opportunity for
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
people to invest in real estate on a
 
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
small basis and provide better housing
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities throughout the state of
 
01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.350 align:start position:0%
opportunities throughout the state of
New

01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire other comments on this bill
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative Howen so so I understand
 
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
actually uh the the need for development
 
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
especially for developers to to be able
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
to recoup their cost my my real con
 
01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
concern really was um is we have a good
 
01:21:30.669 --> 01:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
cause for eviction but under the there's
 
01:21:33.149 --> 01:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
really no good cause for like renewal of
 
01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
lease really written in and so I think
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
it was alluded to up here that only like
 
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
133% of uh renters median income you
 
01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
know if you took median income of all
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
the renters only 133% of them actually
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
can afford a two bedroom apartment and
 
01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
that just speaks to how many people are
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
rent burdened and so two months really
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
is not enough time for them if they're
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
if it's sudden and you're a renter and
 
01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
that comes up you don't have enough time
 
01:22:05.229 --> 01:22:05.239 align:start position:0%
or security deposit to come up with uh
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
with the money to come up with a new
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
apartment and I think Crossroads
 
01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned it's about aund and $20 a day
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh to to house somebody that's lost
 
01:22:17.709 --> 01:22:17.719 align:start position:0%
their housing and so I just think the
 
01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
way it's worked there's not enough
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
notification so it it I want a better
 
01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
balance that helps the landlords but
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
also gives better um notification to the
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
tenants and so I don't think this bill
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
does it so that's why I can't support
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
it representative Paige thank you Mr
 
01:22:39.149 --> 01:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
chair um I can't I can't support this
 
01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
bill either um and I keep I understand
 
01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:44.750 align:start position:0%
bill either um and I keep I understand
in

01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
principle why one could support this
 
01:22:49.950 --> 01:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
bill and I I understand as a landlord
 
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
myself who has lived some of these
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
issues on that side of it uh um I
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
understand as somebody who has talked to
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
folks trying to go through an eviction
 
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
process and the challenge that that
 
01:23:07.229 --> 01:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
presents so I get it I get why it seems
 
01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
desirable but then I also have to hear
 
01:23:12.669 --> 01:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
in my head The Echoes of everyone who
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
came to
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
testify uh New Hampshire housing the
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
Coalition and
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
homelessness um the our local welfare
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
agencies and
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
person after person came up and
 
01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
testified and said very
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
clearly this is going to drive
 
01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
additional homelessness in our state and
 
01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.030 align:start position:0%
additional homelessness in our state and
for

01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
me you know setting aside the principle
 
01:23:40.990 --> 01:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
which I understand the Practical reality
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
of this bill as I see it is we're going
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
to put more people into homelessness and
 
01:23:48.510 --> 01:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
it's folks in every one of our districts
 
01:23:49.950 --> 01:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's moms and their kids living
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
out of the car it's you know seniors up
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
in the north country where I am who are
 
01:23:57.390 --> 01:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
living in tents in the woods um and we
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
already have a real
 
01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:00.510 align:start position:0%
already have a real
epidemic

01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
epidemic
 
01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
and at this moment in time I just
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
personally feel that this change is is
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
irresponsible so that's where I am
 
01:24:11.229 --> 01:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
coming from on this
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair I also can't
 
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
support this bill uh I do understand the
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
argument uh for fairness to the landlord
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of the equal understanding of
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
the contract between tenant and landlord
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
but in the current housing market with
 
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
the difficulty of finding any Apartments
 
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
let alone affordable
 
01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
apartments um the risk of putting people
 
01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
on the street of evicting without good
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
cause and people the result being that
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
people are homeless I'm just not willing
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
to um support that
 
01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:53.639 align:start position:0%
risk thank you representative
 
01:24:53.639 --> 01:24:55.629 align:start position:0%
risk thank you representative
representative

01:24:55.629 --> 01:24:55.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
um I think we're using the word eviction
 
01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
irresponsibly this is not an eviction
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:07.629 --> 01:25:07.639 align:start position:0%
contract um just so on my end I mean
 
01:25:09.629 --> 01:25:09.639 align:start position:0%
this to add on to that this is a lease
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
this is a contract that was signed for a
 
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
specific amount of time um it's it's a
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
property rights issue and I think the
 
01:25:18.189 --> 01:25:18.199 align:start position:0%
what's important is we we noted that you
 
01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
know housing providers do not want to go
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
through finding a new tenant that's not
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
like their top priority it's actually
 
01:25:27.109 --> 01:25:27.119 align:start position:0%
very expensive for them to do that
 
01:25:29.109 --> 01:25:29.119 align:start position:0%
between application costs and other
 
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
things so they wouldn't use this as a
 
01:25:36.189 --> 01:25:36.199 align:start position:0%
way to you know they wouldn't use this
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
to to get rid of a tenant they would use
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
this um if if the situation they they
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
they they would only use it if it was
 
01:25:48.109 --> 01:25:48.119 align:start position:0%
needed and they want to keep they want
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
to keep good tenants in their in their
 
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
houses and and if it's their property
 
01:25:52.510 --> 01:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
they should be able to do what they want
 
01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
with it and I think that's where I come
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
from on
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
represent paig I guess my question
 
01:25:59.870 --> 01:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
following from that
 
01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
is you know they're only going to use it
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
when they need it what is the need you
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
know we have these other good cause
 
01:26:10.189 --> 01:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
reasons for eviction which I support of
 
01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
course there are there are reasons but
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
you know is it just a personal
 
01:26:17.109 --> 01:26:17.119 align:start position:0%
disagreement with the tenant that you
 
01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
don't like the tenant that to me raises
 
01:26:21.149 --> 01:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
all kinds of issues you know you're
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
saying it's to get rid of a bad tenant
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
well that's why we have eviction for
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
cause um so you know I see this
 
01:26:33.550 --> 01:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
as a a way to skirt that right it's sort
 
01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
of okay well I'm instead of going
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
through this process of an eviction I'm
 
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
just going to wait the three months for
 
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
the lease to be up and then I'm going to
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
evict them for these reasons but I am
 
01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
going to use this as a workaround I mean
 
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
that's what I see this bill doing
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
represent buolo thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know with this and during the
 
01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
testimony I mean my heart really goes
 
01:26:57.149 --> 01:26:57.159 align:start position:0%
out to people because a lot of these are
 
01:26:58.510 --> 01:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
we're hearing testimony of people who
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
are really suffering because of New
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's housing crisis and I think
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
we've also heard from the the testimony
 
01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
that this housing crisis is I think the
 
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
legislative environment the legislature
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
in past sessions is partly to blame for
 
01:27:13.709 --> 01:27:13.719 align:start position:0%
the laws that we have and I think that
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of laws that are
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
made you know to maybe try to address a
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
problem or because there's this very
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
very strong emotional appeal but the
 
01:27:24.189 --> 01:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
long-term consequences of some of these
 
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
laws can really really really be dire so
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
I think that if this bill um were to not
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
pass I think what would happen is you
 
01:27:37.149 --> 01:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
would you would not fix the fundamental
 
01:27:38.669 --> 01:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
problem all that heart-wrenching
 
01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
testimony those people would still be
 
01:27:42.270 --> 01:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
facing High rents they would still be
 
01:27:44.229 --> 01:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
facing housing uncertainty we'd still
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
have escalating homelessness and
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
actually in fact you'd have a lot of
 
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
housing providers who would be dissuaded
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
from putting their property up because
 
01:27:53.229 --> 01:27:53.239 align:start position:0%
they' think W man but if I have a
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
problem tenant they're going to be
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
really difficult to get rid of or I'm
 
01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
going to have to go have good cause or
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have to go to court which
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
is an expensive time-consuming and
 
01:28:02.830 --> 01:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
intimidating process especially for the
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
small mom and pop housing providers so I
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
think the net effect of this not passing
 
01:28:10.590 --> 01:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
will be a continuation of the housing
 
01:28:12.270 --> 01:28:12.280 align:start position:0%
crisis it will not help any of the
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
people who were facing possible
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
evictions and it actually probably could
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
make it more difficult um in the
 
01:28:21.070 --> 01:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
testimony one of the questions I asked
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
was would if this bill would pass would
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
it make it easier for housing providers
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
to provide housing would it encourage
 
01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
that and the answer is yes so I think
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
let's do things which align incentives
 
01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
and allow people to provide
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
housing representative um Dumont and
 
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
Howland I just want to say as as real
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
estate broker a developer and a landlord
 
01:28:44.709 --> 01:28:44.719 align:start position:0%
one thing that I've always seen is that
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
what always makes for a successful
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
relationship is when a contract is fair
 
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
and equal on both sides and I would say
 
01:28:51.390 --> 01:28:51.400 align:start position:0%
that this would allow both sides to come
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
to the table and renegotiate a contract
 
01:28:56.590 --> 01:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
to benefit both parties with more notice
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
rather than a landlord just serving a
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
30-day eviction
 
01:29:04.149 --> 01:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
notice representen so um I I think I
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
probably everybody hopefully is in
 
01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
agreement that the best thing is to have
 
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
a tenant on a contract every you know
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
you really want your tenant on a
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
contract I think what really struck me
 
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
was the lawyer who came up here and
 
01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
talked about how many people are
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
actually off the contract more at will
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
and month to month and you you never
 
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
want the month to month because it's bad
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
for a landlord because it it it's
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
uncertainty to the landlord and it's bad
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
for the ten tenant because it gives
 
01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
uncertainty to them and so that's why I
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
keep coming back to the notification it
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
it's better if if if the landlord is uh
 
01:29:40.189 --> 01:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
not waiting till 60 days before the
 
01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
contract is over but there's more
 
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
notification particularly if a tenant
 
01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
has shown good cause if you've paid your
 
01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
rent for say six months you've been a
 
01:29:50.189 --> 01:29:50.199 align:start position:0%
good tenant you haven't caused any
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
problems that the landlord is able to
 
01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
exercise more of an an option to say
 
01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
look you're a great tenant you've
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
already said it's expensive to replace
 
01:30:00.910 --> 01:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
them why not give more notification to
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
the tenant maybe at the six-month level
 
01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
saying look would you like to renew the
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
lease it's going to cost this much more
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
money is that feasible that way it
 
01:30:11.950 --> 01:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
provide certainty to the landlord they
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
know if the tenant says yes I can I can
 
01:30:16.590 --> 01:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
do it and you're going to renew the
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
lease and there's no time with the
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
tenants off the lease but by the same
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
token if the tenants one of those rent
 
01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
uh stressed people and you say no your
 
01:30:26.109 --> 01:30:26.119 align:start position:0%
your rent's going to go up
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
$200 the person says no I can't afford
 
01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
it there's a longer time period for the
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
tenant to work with some of the social
 
01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
agencies to figure out where they are
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
where they are so that we don't get to
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
the end of the lease and the person is
 
01:30:41.629 --> 01:30:41.639 align:start position:0%
like suddenly left hanging so I I'm not
 
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
sure how to actually work that out in
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
there but I think that's what we're
 
01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:47.719 align:start position:0%
really trying to
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
achieve representative Kerwin I just
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
want to add to that that I feel that um
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
like uh representative howand was saying
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
that in this housing market you could
 
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
have good tenants who have paid the rent
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
the whole the whole term of the lease
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
and when the lease ends they cannot
 
01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
afford the um increase in rent but they
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
in that short period of time they will
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
not be able to find housing again and
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
then the eviction process will start and
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
they will have an eviction and which
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
will make it even harder to find housing
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
so I am concerned that especially in
 
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
this housing market it is not possible
 
01:31:25.709 --> 01:31:25.719 align:start position:0%
to find an apartment that
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
quickly represent
 
01:31:30.629 --> 01:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
minor if their rent was increased in
 
01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
that short of a notice they would end up
 
01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
with a 30-day the lease would be over
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
and they would be a tenant at will at
 
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
that point and they would get a 30-day
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
only notice for an eviction well a 7-Day
 
01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
notice if they couldn't pay the
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
increment and then be out within about
 
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
30 days anyways and also with the lease
 
01:31:52.189 --> 01:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
they have one year's notice they don't
 
01:31:54.669 --> 01:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
have 60 days they know that it could
 
01:31:59.669 --> 01:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
possibly end in a year so maybe if we
 
01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
could all as a tenant even could do
 
01:32:03.629 --> 01:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
their due diligence and go to the
 
01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
landlord and say hey my contract's up in
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
six months uh what's going to happen do
 
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
you have any idea instead of the
 
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
landlord having to have the burden to go
 
01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
talk to
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
them represent Von I just want to
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
reiterate the point that representative
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
Miner made
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
under the current Rules of Engagement
 
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
between a landlord and a
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
tenant a landlord can raise the rent at
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
the give 30 days notice at the end of
 
01:32:42.109 --> 01:32:42.119 align:start position:0%
the 11th month and raise their rent
 
01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
50% and they're gone they have less
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
notice than you would have under this
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
bill and it it's terribly unfair to the
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
small property owner and 73% of rental
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
properties in New Hampshire are owned by
 
01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
small owners and individuals who own
 
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
less than four units and they're not
 
01:33:09.109 --> 01:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
versed in the fancy ways of the law and
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
the legislature they are very average
 
01:33:14.109 --> 01:33:14.119 align:start position:0%
people who think they signed a contract
 
01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:17.560 align:start position:0%
for a year and at the end of the year
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
you should be able to say you I got
 
01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
something else I want to do with my
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
property and there's also a a failure in
 
01:33:27.070 --> 01:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
the logic that we're all listening to in
 
01:33:29.790 --> 01:33:29.800 align:start position:0%
here there's nothing in this bill that
 
01:33:32.350 --> 01:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
says and now the housing unit has gone
 
01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
away it's simply going to the next
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
person in the housing
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
queue and most as a practical matter as
 
01:33:43.109 --> 01:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
a landlord and as a property manager
 
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
there are turnover costs so if I'm
 
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
looking at somewhere between
 
01:33:51.629 --> 01:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
$255,000 in turnover costs which seems
 
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
to be where we're at right now because
 
01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
as lady said earlier Lumber is
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
expensive if I'm looking at those costs
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not looking to willy-nilly throw
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
people out so I've got to have a
 
01:34:07.229 --> 01:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
motivating reason to terminate a
 
01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
tency just my thoughts I think that
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
you're giving people with 60 days notice
 
01:34:14.669 --> 01:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
you're giving them more notice than they
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
have now and you're giving a Far More
 
01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
Level Playing Field between the average
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
property owner in this state and the
 
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
average tenant
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron I just want to Echo
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
what representative Miner said it's a
 
01:34:31.470 --> 01:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
two-way street the tenant has every
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
right currently and after this
 
01:34:36.669 --> 01:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
legislation is passed to go to the
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
landlord and say hey my lease is up in 4
 
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
months three months can we renew it so
 
01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to stop the tenant from
 
01:34:48.109 --> 01:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
doing that if I was a tenant I'd be on
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
top of my lease
 
01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
period other comments about this
 
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
represent page I just I I just want to
 
01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.510 align:start position:0%
represent page I just I I just want to
resurface

01:34:58.510 --> 01:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
resurface
 
01:35:01.109 --> 01:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
um one comment that was made in
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
testimony that I found disturbing about
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
this um and I recognized that
 
01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
retaliation is illegal now and will
 
01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
remain illegal after this passes but
 
01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
when the lawyer from NH legal assistance
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
was testifying and talking about how she
 
01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
would counsel her clients should this
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
pass I found that to be Illuminating and
 
01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
disturbing that you know if if she were
 
01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
if she were providing counsel to a
 
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
client who were a victim of retaliatory
 
01:35:36.510 --> 01:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
action and they were evicted under this
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
law should it pass that her advice would
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
basically be tough luck like you're out
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
because the end of it's the end of your
 
01:35:45.790 --> 01:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
lease term there's really nothing we can
 
01:35:50.189 --> 01:35:50.199 align:start position:0%
do even if it was secretly motivated by
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
a retal
 
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
retaliatory um as a retaliatory action
 
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
and I I find that unsettling and I just
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
want that stated for the record
 
01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:02.109 align:start position:0%
want that stated for the record
representa

01:36:02.109 --> 01:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
representa
 
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
Axton so if this law were to pass the
 
01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
meter if if if I if I as a landl Lord
 
01:36:11.790 --> 01:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
provided notice to a tenant 60 days
 
01:36:13.629 --> 01:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
before in compliance with all the forms
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
here and said and now on June 30th the
 
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
that's the end of your tency you need to
 
01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:23.679 align:start position:0%
go if the tenant does not go I then have
 
01:36:25.709 --> 01:36:25.719 align:start position:0%
to go through the normal eviction
 
01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
process at at the court I have to give
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
them a demand I have to post an eviction
 
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
notice I have to give them seven days to
 
01:36:38.109 --> 01:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
perform if they fail to do that then I
 
01:36:40.030 --> 01:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
have to go to the sheriff have the
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
sheriff serve them and then we have a
 
01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
hearing and the judge judges in this
 
01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
state still have a 90-day discretionary
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this law that changes
 
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
it the judge still has the a 90-day
 
01:36:54.669 --> 01:36:54.679 align:start position:0%
discretionary Stay on any eviction so
 
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
which obviously are you know they're
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
taken on a case-by Case basis sometimes
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's right away mostly it's 60 or 90
 
01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
days the point is we're not we're not
 
01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
taking anything away from the tenants
 
01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
that they don't currently have what we
 
01:37:12.990 --> 01:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
are doing is we are giving an option or
 
01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
returning a right back to the property
 
01:37:19.629 --> 01:37:19.639 align:start position:0%
owner to say our contract is over I
 
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
don't want to renegotiate I want to move
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
on so potentially
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
and the way I read this bill if if a
 
01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
tenant If a landlord properly gives a
 
01:37:31.149 --> 01:37:31.159 align:start position:0%
60-day notice at the end of the bill
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
there's up you're really looking at a
 
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
femon period based on going to court if
 
01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
the person if the tenant says I'm happy
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
to go there's really nothing to discuss
 
01:37:42.669 --> 01:37:42.679 align:start position:0%
it's not an eviction it's just the end
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
of the contract and so I think a
 
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
disproportionate amount of uh discussion
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
has been made on how this is a terrible
 
01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
thing and an eviction it only becomes an
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
eviction when when I have to go to court
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
and I have to have the court beat you
 
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
property okay seeing nothing else I'm
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
going to uh have the clerk call the roll
 
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:07.840 align:start position:0%

all right it is 10:5 we're going to get
 
02:52:30.429 --> 02:52:30.439 align:start position:0%
the housing committee back to order I'm
 
02:52:33.070 --> 02:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
going to open the public hearing on HP
 
02:52:36.910 --> 02:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
382 and call on um representative Joe
 
02:52:39.110 --> 02:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
Sweeney the prime sponsor who I just
 
02:52:42.309 --> 02:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
only met recently welcome all right
 
02:52:44.030 --> 02:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chairman Alexander
 
02:52:45.910 --> 02:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
and to the uh New Hampshire housing
 
02:52:47.710 --> 02:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
committee I really appreciate that we
 
02:52:49.670 --> 02:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
have a permanent housing committee uh
 
02:52:51.429 --> 02:52:51.439 align:start position:0%
now to tackle the housing crisis in our
 
02:52:53.710 --> 02:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
state uh I'm very proud to introduce
 
02:52:55.229 --> 02:52:55.239 align:start position:0%
this legislation uh for the record my
 
02:52:56.510 --> 02:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
name is representative Joe Sweeny from
 
02:52:58.830 --> 02:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 25 um and I think I would
 
02:53:01.269 --> 02:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
just uh could briefly describe this
 
02:53:03.710 --> 02:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
legislation as the end of the spectrum
 
02:53:06.550 --> 02:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
of parking reform uh we did significant
 
02:53:09.190 --> 02:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
and great work in the last term uh when
 
02:53:11.790 --> 02:53:11.800 align:start position:0%
this was just a special committee on uh
 
02:53:13.790 --> 02:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
parking reform across the state to make
 
02:53:15.469 --> 02:53:15.479 align:start position:0%
sure that we can encourage more multif
 
02:53:18.150 --> 02:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
family development in the State uh and
 
02:53:20.349 --> 02:53:20.359 align:start position:0%
it really does require a little bit when
 
02:53:22.910 --> 02:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
we're reading through the legislation uh
 
02:53:24.830 --> 02:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
a vision that we all have to have for
 
02:53:26.870 --> 02:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire uh it kind of
 
02:53:28.870 --> 02:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
helps if you if you drive through a
 
02:53:30.550 --> 02:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
commercial town so I represent the town
 
02:53:33.190 --> 02:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
of Salem uh we have Route 28 that runs
 
02:53:35.510 --> 02:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
up and down our town we've had a lot of
 
02:53:37.030 --> 02:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
great commercial development over the
 
02:53:39.229 --> 02:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
years that have made us a great town uh
 
02:53:42.309 --> 02:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
and we have a lot of unused parking uh
 
02:53:43.990 --> 02:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
and that parking is there not because
 
02:53:45.389 --> 02:53:45.399 align:start position:0%
the people that were building the
 
02:53:48.070 --> 02:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
developments wanted all that parking uh
 
02:53:49.469 --> 02:53:49.479 align:start position:0%
but because because there are formulas
 
02:53:51.630 --> 02:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
within local zoning codes and and
 
02:53:53.030 --> 02:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
government formulas that have developed
 
02:53:55.830 --> 02:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
over the years uh that have made sure
 
02:53:58.190 --> 02:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
there is ample parking uh a lot of
 
02:53:59.990 --> 02:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
people will refer to it as Black Friday
 
02:54:01.510 --> 02:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
parking so that there's enough parking
 
02:54:04.510 --> 02:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
for busy stretches of days for just one
 
02:54:07.910 --> 02:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
day a year and it's to me it's a it's a
 
02:54:09.269 --> 02:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
housing concern it's also just a
 
02:54:11.229 --> 02:54:11.239 align:start position:0%
development concern because when when
 
02:54:12.870 --> 02:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
you look at the actual physical space
 
02:54:15.229 --> 02:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
that a parking spot takes up where it's
 
02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
9 feet across and 20 feet uh down uh you
 
02:54:21.349 --> 02:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
take just two parking spots and you have
 
02:54:24.030 --> 02:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
the footprint for a studio or a
 
02:54:26.550 --> 02:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
one-bedroom apartment um even even a
 
02:54:28.830 --> 02:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
generous two-bedroom a small two-bedroom
 
02:54:30.830 --> 02:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
apartment you could fit just on two
 
02:54:33.229 --> 02:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
parking spaces so when we look at the
 
02:54:35.349 --> 02:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
the leral space that we have and The
 
02:54:37.150 --> 02:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
Limited space we have in the state for
 
02:54:39.229 --> 02:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
development especially for new uh
 
02:54:42.870 --> 02:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
redevelopments of already paved Lots in
 
02:54:44.429 --> 02:54:44.439 align:start position:0%
the state without having to cut down
 
02:54:47.389 --> 02:54:47.399 align:start position:0%
trees or to go into untouched uh Parcels
 
02:54:48.870 --> 02:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
of open space
 
02:54:51.590 --> 02:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh The best scenario would be to just
 
02:54:53.910 --> 02:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
enable developers to examine their
 
02:54:55.950 --> 02:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
current properties that they have and
 
02:54:58.750 --> 02:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
allow them to build more housing more
 
02:55:00.030 --> 02:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
and there not just housing they can
 
02:55:02.630 --> 02:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
build more commercial operations on the
 
02:55:03.950 --> 02:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
existing lots that have already been
 
02:55:07.389 --> 02:55:07.399 align:start position:0%
paved onto the Earth uh at the end of
 
02:55:09.070 --> 02:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
the day and and to anybody that's
 
02:55:10.429 --> 02:55:10.439 align:start position:0%
watching this or to any of the committee
 
02:55:12.670 --> 02:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
members this will not lead to zero
 
02:55:14.710 --> 02:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
parking spots in New Hampshire after the
 
02:55:16.550 --> 02:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill is signed there will still be
 
02:55:18.429 --> 02:55:18.439 align:start position:0%
plenty of parking a developer is is
 
02:55:21.070 --> 02:55:21.080 align:start position:0%
going to build as much parking as a
 
02:55:23.469 --> 02:55:23.479 align:start position:0%
developer needs in order to Market their
 
02:55:27.269 --> 02:55:27.279 align:start position:0%
development so whether that is one unit
 
02:55:29.870 --> 02:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh one parking space per unit for their
 
02:55:32.110 --> 02:55:32.120 align:start position:0%
development if that's two parking spaces
 
02:55:34.389 --> 02:55:34.399 align:start position:0%
per unit if they have a restaurant and
 
02:55:36.429 --> 02:55:36.439 align:start position:0%
they want to have 40 parking spaces for
 
02:55:38.830 --> 02:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
the tables that should be up to the
 
02:55:40.790 --> 02:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
developer uh in the ongoing
 
02:55:42.429 --> 02:55:42.439 align:start position:0%
conversations we're having in the state
 
02:55:44.429 --> 02:55:44.439 align:start position:0%
about permit reforms and regulations and
 
02:55:47.229 --> 02:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
cutting red tape uh this the parking
 
02:55:49.590 --> 02:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
formulas that each Town varies town by
 
02:55:52.349 --> 02:55:52.359 align:start position:0%
town uh do add a lot of red tape and a
 
02:55:55.550 --> 02:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
lot of unease to the development process
 
02:55:57.790 --> 02:55:57.800 align:start position:0%
uh we have enabled uh under our zoning
 
02:55:59.110 --> 02:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
code and under the laws of the State of
 
02:56:00.590 --> 02:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we've enabled
 
02:56:02.429 --> 02:56:02.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities to adopt parking
 
02:56:04.950 --> 02:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
regulations uh and this bill says you
 
02:56:06.910 --> 02:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
know what we we tried the parking uh
 
02:56:18.469 --> 02:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:20.830 --> 02:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
the conversations to go forward uh with
 
02:56:23.670 --> 02:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
the developers in mind to utilize some
 
02:56:25.389 --> 02:56:25.399 align:start position:0%
of that parking space some of that real
 
02:56:28.229 --> 02:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
estate for more productive uses uh and
 
02:56:29.510 --> 02:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
then we could get into a whole other
 
02:56:31.710 --> 02:56:31.720 align:start position:0%
category about how it will help local
 
02:56:33.830 --> 02:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers because those parking lots are
 
02:56:37.630 --> 02:56:37.640 align:start position:0%
a drain on our tax base in uh throughout
 
02:56:39.229 --> 02:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities and throughout the state
 
02:56:40.790 --> 02:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
but that's kind of a 10,000 foot
 
02:56:42.309 --> 02:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
overview over this legislation I'm happy
 
02:56:44.110 --> 02:56:44.120 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions the committee
 
02:56:45.750 --> 02:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
may have and I'm just glad to be here
 
02:56:46.910 --> 02:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Sweeney are
 
02:56:47.950 --> 02:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
there questions for representative
 
02:56:47.960 --> 02:56:51.710 align:start position:0%
there questions for representative
Sweeney

02:56:51.710 --> 02:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:54.229 --> 02:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative buo yeah I just have a
 
02:56:56.750 --> 02:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
quick question um you know obviously as
 
02:56:58.630 --> 02:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
time goes on um what people use for
 
02:57:00.389 --> 02:57:00.399 align:start position:0%
transportation changes I mean you know
 
02:57:02.469 --> 02:57:02.479 align:start position:0%
if we looked at something 150 years ago
 
02:57:04.469 --> 02:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
I me people are using a horse and buggy
 
02:57:07.710 --> 02:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
with the anticipated changes with
 
02:57:10.030 --> 02:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
self-driving Cars ride shares things
 
02:57:12.510 --> 02:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
like that in the future is there an
 
02:57:15.150 --> 02:57:15.160 align:start position:0%
expectation that parking needs will be
 
02:57:17.309 --> 02:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
less that's a phenomenal question
 
02:57:20.070 --> 02:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative I I I I would say I agree
 
02:57:22.590 --> 02:57:22.600 align:start position:0%
with you uh that that definitely the the
 
02:57:25.269 --> 02:57:25.279 align:start position:0%
need for parking is will be less we're
 
02:57:27.870 --> 02:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
also in a very fascinating time in human
 
02:57:30.269 --> 02:57:30.279 align:start position:0%
history where starting in the post-war
 
02:57:33.830 --> 02:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
era the pattern of development of sub
 
02:57:35.670 --> 02:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
Suburban development and just the way we
 
02:57:38.190 --> 02:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
built out sprawl and made it so that you
 
02:57:40.030 --> 02:57:40.040 align:start position:0%
know every place had to have ample
 
02:57:42.910 --> 02:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
parking for twice as many people uh the
 
02:57:45.229 --> 02:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
econom is changing the way we we commun
 
02:57:46.950 --> 02:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
the way we transport and the and the way
 
02:57:49.110 --> 02:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
we interact with one another the economy
 
02:57:51.349 --> 02:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
is constantly changing so I I just to
 
02:57:52.309 --> 02:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
say I
 
02:57:55.229 --> 02:57:55.239 align:start position:0%
agree representative Hicks thank you Mr
 
02:57:57.830 --> 02:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you for this
 
02:57:59.790 --> 02:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
legislation I think it's interesting one
 
02:58:02.070 --> 02:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
question I have and having seen this in
 
02:58:04.710 --> 02:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
planning board for a decade and a half
 
02:58:08.750 --> 02:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
what if a what if a business um does not
 
02:58:12.150 --> 02:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
create enough parking and there is too
 
02:58:16.190 --> 02:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
much demand what does the municipality
 
02:58:17.630 --> 02:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
do about that what is the recourse in
 
02:58:17.640 --> 02:58:19.750 align:start position:0%
do about that what is the recourse in
municipality

02:58:19.750 --> 02:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
02:58:21.670 --> 02:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
I I would think that if a business were
 
02:58:24.229 --> 02:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
to develop were to build out their their
 
02:58:25.910 --> 02:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
retail or their their housing and they
 
02:58:28.190 --> 02:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
didn't have the parking to support it
 
02:58:30.389 --> 02:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
that business would not do
 
02:58:32.910 --> 02:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
well because if people aren't able to to
 
02:58:34.670 --> 02:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
go to the actual business if there's not
 
02:58:37.389 --> 02:58:37.399 align:start position:0%
Transit options around if there's not uh
 
02:58:38.990 --> 02:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities for people to get to that
 
02:58:40.950 --> 02:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
Business Without parking their car I
 
02:58:42.630 --> 02:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
think from a market standpoint that
 
02:58:45.910 --> 02:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
business won't survive so I and and and
 
02:58:47.389 --> 02:58:47.399 align:start position:0%
there there might be questions we face
 
02:58:48.550 --> 02:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
as external
 
02:58:50.429 --> 02:58:50.439 align:start position:0%
externalities from the municipal
 
02:58:52.309 --> 02:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
standpoint but at the end of the day if
 
02:58:53.750 --> 02:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
you if you're a business model that
 
02:58:56.070 --> 02:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
relies on having enough parking and you
 
02:58:58.229 --> 02:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
don't Supply that parking that's on you
 
02:58:59.790 --> 02:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
as the business owner and as on the
 
02:59:01.510 --> 02:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
developer and you'd either have to
 
02:59:03.389 --> 02:59:03.399 align:start position:0%
partner with local businesses to work
 
02:59:05.910 --> 02:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
out a shared parking agreement uh but I
 
02:59:07.190 --> 02:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
would just leave that up to the market
 
02:59:07.200 --> 02:59:08.830 align:start position:0%
would just leave that up to the market
to

02:59:08.830 --> 02:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:59:11.830 --> 02:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
decide representative howand um I just
 
02:59:15.429 --> 02:59:15.439 align:start position:0%
have one question so 674 215 is impact
 
02:59:17.550 --> 02:59:17.560 align:start position:0%
fees and so you're saying you don't want
 
02:59:19.830 --> 02:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
me to ities to regulate parking would
 
02:59:22.030 --> 02:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
you not want municipalities to charge
 
02:59:25.349 --> 02:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
impact fees that potentially would go to
 
02:59:27.710 --> 02:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
parking impact fees that would go to par
 
02:59:29.950 --> 02:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
I don't the purpose of this legislation
 
02:59:32.349 --> 02:59:32.359 align:start position:0%
is not to touch the impact fees so if
 
02:59:33.990 --> 02:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's how you would read it that it
 
02:59:36.030 --> 02:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
impacts the impact fees impacts the
 
02:59:39.030 --> 02:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
impact say that 10 times fast um then I
 
02:59:40.349 --> 02:59:40.359 align:start position:0%
I certainly might be worthy of an
 
02:59:42.590 --> 02:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to make sure the impact fees
 
02:59:46.590 --> 02:59:46.600 align:start position:0%
authorization is protected um but I I I
 
02:59:48.670 --> 02:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
really just want to take away the
 
02:59:50.590 --> 02:59:50.600 align:start position:0%
the regulation and the requirement that
 
02:59:51.910 --> 02:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
there's a certain number of parking
 
02:59:53.309 --> 02:59:53.319 align:start position:0%
spots determined by the municipality
 
02:59:55.389 --> 02:59:55.399 align:start position:0%
that each type of business or housing
 
02:59:59.510 --> 02:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:01.870 --> 03:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
have other questions representative
 
03:00:03.990 --> 03:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
Sweeney seeing none thank you great
 
03:00:06.389 --> 03:00:06.399 align:start position:0%
thank you all so much all right next up
 
03:00:11.910 --> 03:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:14.910 --> 03:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
GRE thank you Mr chair n Grace for the
 
03:00:16.710 --> 03:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association we are
 
03:00:18.269 --> 03:00:18.279 align:start position:0%
the Statewide Chamber of Commerce and we
 
03:00:19.750 --> 03:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
are in support of this
 
03:00:22.590 --> 03:00:22.600 align:start position:0%
legislation um I think uh representative
 
03:00:24.030 --> 03:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
Sweeny touched on a number of points
 
03:00:25.309 --> 03:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
that I want to touch on so in the
 
03:00:26.910 --> 03:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
interest of time I will not be
 
03:00:29.870 --> 03:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
repetitive um but what I do want to
 
03:00:32.870 --> 03:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
point out is uh under the legislation uh
 
03:00:34.550 --> 03:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
that was created last year we now have a
 
03:00:36.830 --> 03:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
very complex set of State uh rules
 
03:00:40.349 --> 03:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
regarding parking um a a better option
 
03:00:44.070 --> 03:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
for this uh would be to simplify it um
 
03:00:47.349 --> 03:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
the current statutory scheme sets up a
 
03:00:50.750 --> 03:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
lengthy uh basically regulatory process
 
03:00:52.670 --> 03:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
that developers uh would have to go
 
03:00:54.229 --> 03:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
through if they want to do something
 
03:00:55.870 --> 03:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
other than what the minimum parking
 
03:01:00.710 --> 03:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
requirements uh require currently um so
 
03:01:03.790 --> 03:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
this would both simplify that process um
 
03:01:06.790 --> 03:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
but also to go to uh I think a point
 
03:01:09.070 --> 03:01:09.080 align:start position:0%
that was uh made by uh representative
 
03:01:10.830 --> 03:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
Hicks over here a question represent
 
03:01:14.429 --> 03:01:14.439 align:start position:0%
made by um representative Hicks is um
 
03:01:17.030 --> 03:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know depending where you are in the
 
03:01:18.429 --> 03:01:18.439 align:start position:0%
state and the pattern of development
 
03:01:19.950 --> 03:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to that's going to dictate
 
03:01:23.389 --> 03:01:23.399 align:start position:0%
kind of the natural um the natural
 
03:01:25.990 --> 03:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
aptitude for creating uh additional
 
03:01:28.630 --> 03:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
parking spaces unless I'm mistaken I
 
03:01:30.269 --> 03:01:30.279 align:start position:0%
believe it's the case that conquer does
 
03:01:32.710 --> 03:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
not have any parking requirements for
 
03:01:35.710 --> 03:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
downtown um and yet there are a number
 
03:01:37.389 --> 03:01:37.399 align:start position:0%
of flourishing businesses here there are
 
03:01:40.429 --> 03:01:40.439 align:start position:0%
alternative parking options um whereas
 
03:01:42.870 --> 03:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
if you know you're outside the city in a
 
03:01:44.469 --> 03:01:44.479 align:start position:0%
more rural area you're going to need
 
03:01:47.030 --> 03:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
parking on site for your business um but
 
03:01:48.150 --> 03:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
that's something that's going to be
 
03:01:50.870 --> 03:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
assessed uh by developers at the time
 
03:01:53.070 --> 03:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
for on the commercial side and then on
 
03:01:56.110 --> 03:01:56.120 align:start position:0%
the residential side same thing is uh
 
03:01:57.790 --> 03:01:57.800 align:start position:0%
you know if you're building for a
 
03:01:59.349 --> 03:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
population that's not likely to have as
 
03:02:02.269 --> 03:02:02.279 align:start position:0%
many vehicles you know uh maybe an
 
03:02:03.910 --> 03:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
elderly Community you're not going to
 
03:02:06.309 --> 03:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
need as much parking as you would for a
 
03:02:08.510 --> 03:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
community that's geared towards uh maybe
 
03:02:10.830 --> 03:02:10.840 align:start position:0%
young professionals who are more likely
 
03:02:14.070 --> 03:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
to be uh have a two Family household uh
 
03:02:15.830 --> 03:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
have two cars and be commuting to work
 
03:02:18.990 --> 03:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
so you know these things can be done at
 
03:02:20.469 --> 03:02:20.479 align:start position:0%
the developer level they don't they
 
03:02:23.229 --> 03:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
don't need uh local regulation to
 
03:02:25.670 --> 03:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
accomplish it have to take any questions
 
03:02:29.229 --> 03:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
the committee may have questions for Mr
 
03:02:33.070 --> 03:02:33.080 align:start position:0%
Grace seeing none thank
 
03:02:37.110 --> 03:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
you maybe we're just waking up lunch um
 
03:02:51.469 --> 03:02:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:54.030 --> 03:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Representatives my name
 
03:02:56.190 --> 03:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
is Sarah Burke Cohen I represent the new
 
03:02:58.870 --> 03:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association the
 
03:03:03.030 --> 03:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
nhma um opposes House Bill 382 I'm sure
 
03:03:05.950 --> 03:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
you're not surprised um so we have a
 
03:03:10.830 --> 03:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
number of issues with it um we feel like
 
03:03:13.870 --> 03:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
uh although we appreciate um development
 
03:03:16.190 --> 03:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
and um understand the housing crisis in
 
03:03:18.510 --> 03:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire We Believe that local
 
03:03:20.590 --> 03:03:20.600 align:start position:0%
control is important for this issue of
 
03:03:24.309 --> 03:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
parking um on-site parking currently the
 
03:03:26.190 --> 03:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
way the statute is written is it allows
 
03:03:28.830 --> 03:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities to to have control of
 
03:03:32.950 --> 03:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
their local land to my local land use
 
03:03:35.150 --> 03:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
and it allows them to determine in what
 
03:03:37.870 --> 03:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
areas maybe on-site parking or as much
 
03:03:40.469 --> 03:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
on-site parking may not be necessary I
 
03:03:43.510 --> 03:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
think that um the testimony that was
 
03:03:46.269 --> 03:03:46.279 align:start position:0%
just brought up um about development
 
03:03:49.110 --> 03:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
relative to see housing or out of town I
 
03:03:50.670 --> 03:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
know conquered is a little bit different
 
03:03:53.070 --> 03:03:53.080 align:start position:0%
um downtown conquered you have a lot of
 
03:03:55.110 --> 03:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
um ability for on-site uh off-site
 
03:03:57.670 --> 03:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
parking um whereas uh there might be
 
03:03:59.950 --> 03:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
some more ability for um less parking
 
03:04:02.110 --> 03:04:02.120 align:start position:0%
restrictions out out of town or more
 
03:04:05.429 --> 03:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
need for um parking restrictions there's
 
03:04:08.309 --> 03:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of reasons to have uh on-site
 
03:04:11.750 --> 03:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
parking um part of it is certainly
 
03:04:14.429 --> 03:04:14.439 align:start position:0%
health and safety issues um if there is
 
03:04:17.710 --> 03:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of if entities don't have on
 
03:04:19.670 --> 03:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
inside parking where do people Park they
 
03:04:22.870 --> 03:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
park in the street or they Park um in
 
03:04:26.309 --> 03:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
public facilities so some of this can if
 
03:04:28.030 --> 03:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
people are parking haphazardly let's
 
03:04:29.510 --> 03:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
face it we've all seen those people
 
03:04:33.030 --> 03:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
before um it can cause problems for uh
 
03:04:34.309 --> 03:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
safety of people getting out of their
 
03:04:36.510 --> 03:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
driveways maybe somebody lives near a a
 
03:04:38.750 --> 03:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
place where somebody um people are
 
03:04:42.030 --> 03:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
parking half Hazard it also can cause NE
 
03:04:44.710 --> 03:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
more neighbor disputes where people are
 
03:04:47.349 --> 03:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh jocking for spots um certainly we've
 
03:04:50.389 --> 03:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
seen that in area neighborhoods not in
 
03:04:52.190 --> 03:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire necessarily but in Boston
 
03:04:55.389 --> 03:04:55.399 align:start position:0%
where I went to school um there's snow
 
03:04:57.910 --> 03:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
removal issues that can be caused by not
 
03:04:59.429 --> 03:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
having a lot of on-site parking where
 
03:05:01.870 --> 03:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
people are parking on the streets um the
 
03:05:04.990 --> 03:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
community Aesthetics can be affected by
 
03:05:06.710 --> 03:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh not having a lot of on-site parking
 
03:05:08.150 --> 03:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
if people are going to park on the
 
03:05:11.870 --> 03:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
streets um so at the end of the day the
 
03:05:14.710 --> 03:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
people that know best about how to use
 
03:05:18.070 --> 03:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
their land and how to determine what
 
03:05:22.190 --> 03:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
needs on-site parking to as um as stated
 
03:05:24.469 --> 03:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
by the statue right now and maybe what
 
03:05:27.349 --> 03:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
needs less on-site parking is the local
 
03:05:30.030 --> 03:05:30.040 align:start position:0%
uh the local town or municipality so
 
03:05:33.070 --> 03:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
therefore uh New Hampshire Municipal
 
03:05:36.070 --> 03:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
Association opposes the spill I'll take
 
03:05:36.080 --> 03:05:38.429 align:start position:0%
Association opposes the spill I'll take
questions

03:05:38.429 --> 03:05:38.439 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:05:41.910 --> 03:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
questions um so yeah my concern is over
 
03:05:44.070 --> 03:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
the retaliatory nature of requiring
 
03:05:45.790 --> 03:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
parking spaces
 
03:05:47.870 --> 03:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
specifically say a local plan planning
 
03:05:49.309 --> 03:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
board decides they don't want
 
03:05:51.790 --> 03:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing in their town and
 
03:05:53.190 --> 03:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
they say in their ordinance you know
 
03:05:55.389 --> 03:05:55.399 align:start position:0%
what for every manufactured housing unit
 
03:05:58.510 --> 03:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
we need five on-site parking spaces a
 
03:06:01.190 --> 03:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
little ridiculous when you say I hear
 
03:06:03.389 --> 03:06:03.399 align:start position:0%
what you're saying do you think that
 
03:06:05.150 --> 03:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
maybe there should be some sort of guard
 
03:06:07.630 --> 03:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
rails to reain in out of control towns
 
03:06:10.429 --> 03:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
when they tried to zone out specific
 
03:06:12.190 --> 03:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
building or development happening in
 
03:06:14.429 --> 03:06:14.439 align:start position:0%
their Community certainly if
 
03:06:17.429 --> 03:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander had uh language
 
03:06:19.229 --> 03:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
that he would like to produce I'm sure
 
03:06:20.910 --> 03:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
03:06:22.550 --> 03:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
would like look at it and review it it's
 
03:06:24.190 --> 03:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
a great
 
03:06:26.750 --> 03:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
answer other
 
03:06:29.309 --> 03:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none thank
 
03:06:40.070 --> 03:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:42.670 --> 03:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
mushin alander just turn on your mic for
 
03:06:44.190 --> 03:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
us thank you afternoon chairman
 
03:06:45.990 --> 03:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
Alexander and members of the committee
 
03:06:47.630 --> 03:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Matt Mushi and I live in
 
03:06:49.469 --> 03:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
Claremont and I serve as the advocacy
 
03:06:51.349 --> 03:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
and engagement director for a 603
 
03:06:53.910 --> 03:06:53.920 align:start position:0%

organization dedicated to educating
 
03:06:58.030 --> 03:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
activating and empowering young people
 
03:07:00.429 --> 03:07:00.439 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh thrilled to be able
 
03:07:01.790 --> 03:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
to testify in front of this standing
 
03:07:04.190 --> 03:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
housing committee and uh today I'm here
 
03:07:07.710 --> 03:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
to testify in support of House Bill 382
 
03:07:09.950 --> 03:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of evidence that
 
03:07:11.630 --> 03:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
suggests removing costly parking
 
03:07:13.950 --> 03:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
mandates and allowing developers and
 
03:07:16.349 --> 03:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
Property Owners to decide for themselves
 
03:07:18.150 --> 03:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not to build and how much to
 
03:07:20.750 --> 03:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
build of parking will have a positive
 
03:07:23.830 --> 03:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
impact on development and overall
 
03:07:26.429 --> 03:07:26.439 align:start position:0%
affordability parking requirements uh
 
03:07:27.630 --> 03:07:27.640 align:start position:0%
play an important role in housing
 
03:07:30.510 --> 03:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
development in a few ways including the
 
03:07:33.469 --> 03:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
added cost of that parking whether there
 
03:07:35.469 --> 03:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
there is enough developable land to
 
03:07:38.750 --> 03:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
support the parking mandates and the
 
03:07:41.910 --> 03:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
parking development overall uh impact on
 
03:07:44.630 --> 03:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
affordability for tenants most often
 
03:07:47.510 --> 03:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
these parking requirements are minimums
 
03:07:51.870 --> 03:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
set by either per uh bedroom or per unit
 
03:07:54.990 --> 03:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
and these one size fits-all rules really
 
03:07:57.150 --> 03:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
don't take into consideration whether or
 
03:07:59.630 --> 03:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
not a building is on a bus line uh is
 
03:08:02.150 --> 03:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
going to be home for seniors or home to
 
03:08:05.670 --> 03:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
people who just don't have cars um in a
 
03:08:07.710 --> 03:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
recent study allowing home builders to
 
03:08:09.990 --> 03:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
create less parking created significant
 
03:08:11.469 --> 03:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
increases in the number of homes that
 
03:08:13.389 --> 03:08:13.399 align:start position:0%
could be built the study found that
 
03:08:15.030 --> 03:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
allowing home builders to determine
 
03:08:17.110 --> 03:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
where and how much parking to build
 
03:08:19.550 --> 03:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
provid to result in an increase of 40 to
 
03:08:22.830 --> 03:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
70% of homes uh being built as a result
 
03:08:24.429 --> 03:08:24.439 align:start position:0%
of the removal of those arbitrary
 
03:08:28.150 --> 03:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
parking mandates um parking requirements
 
03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
also compete with the land as you've
 
03:08:32.910 --> 03:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
heard and uh on average two parking
 
03:08:35.349 --> 03:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
spots can be can take about the about
 
03:08:38.309 --> 03:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
the same space as a one to two-bedroom
 
03:08:42.030 --> 03:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
apartment um HB 382 takes an important
 
03:08:43.590 --> 03:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
step towards addressing this issue by
 
03:08:45.750 --> 03:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
allowing for just more flexibility in
 
03:08:48.510 --> 03:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
these parking requirements by allowing
 
03:08:50.429 --> 03:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
our policies with modern development
 
03:08:52.870 --> 03:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
needs such as the increase in use of
 
03:08:54.990 --> 03:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
public transportation car sharing
 
03:08:57.309 --> 03:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
programs and things like bike friendly
 
03:08:59.590 --> 03:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure this bill not only
 
03:09:02.030 --> 03:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
reduces the unnecessary cost but also
 
03:09:04.469 --> 03:09:04.479 align:start position:0%
promotes more sustainable and Equitable
 
03:09:07.469 --> 03:09:07.479 align:start position:0%
growth in our communities cities across
 
03:09:09.870 --> 03:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
the country and uh here in New Hampshire
 
03:09:12.269 --> 03:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
have removed parking mandates uh and it
 
03:09:14.229 --> 03:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
is clear that parking is still being
 
03:09:16.389 --> 03:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
built but it's just being built in a
 
03:09:18.670 --> 03:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and responsive way uh
 
03:09:21.389 --> 03:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
supporting HB 382 will make it easier
 
03:09:23.349 --> 03:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
for developers to build housing and to
 
03:09:25.030 --> 03:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of our communities
 
03:09:26.510 --> 03:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
ensuring that more New Hampshire
 
03:09:28.630 --> 03:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
residents can access safe affordable
 
03:09:31.389 --> 03:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
homes and furthermore this reform would
 
03:09:33.349 --> 03:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
help New Hampshire stay competitive and
 
03:09:35.790 --> 03:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
attracting both businesses and residents
 
03:09:37.870 --> 03:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
but also contri contribute to the
 
03:09:40.429 --> 03:09:40.439 align:start position:0%
long-term Vitality of our state uh so we
 
03:09:42.870 --> 03:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
ask you to please vote and support uh
 
03:09:44.550 --> 03:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 382 and I would take any
 
03:09:47.630 --> 03:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
questions questions representative Hicks
 
03:09:48.950 --> 03:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:09:51.309 --> 03:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
testifying today do you think that this
 
03:09:53.429 --> 03:09:53.439 align:start position:0%
um legislation is necessary at the state
 
03:09:56.429 --> 03:09:56.439 align:start position:0%
level um for the reason um that chairman
 
03:09:59.750 --> 03:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
Alexander spoke about and also uh in
 
03:10:02.190 --> 03:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
contrast to what a previous speaker said
 
03:10:04.870 --> 03:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
because many towns are using parking as
 
03:10:06.670 --> 03:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
a way to prevent certain types of
 
03:10:09.469 --> 03:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
housing in our state yeah I think the
 
03:10:11.110 --> 03:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
short answer is yes we see it even with
 
03:10:12.590 --> 03:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
things like accessory dwelling units
 
03:10:16.429 --> 03:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
when towns want to uh perhaps uh
 
03:10:17.990 --> 03:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
discourage the development of those
 
03:10:19.670 --> 03:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
really restrictive parking requirements
 
03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
being placed on that which just is a
 
03:10:23.710 --> 03:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
barrier to that housing being built so
 
03:10:27.550 --> 03:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
yes represent bullio um so let's just do
 
03:10:29.070 --> 03:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
a thought experiment let's just assume
 
03:10:30.790 --> 03:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
that the critics of this legislation are
 
03:10:32.550 --> 03:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
correct and this will lead to a shortage
 
03:10:34.429 --> 03:10:34.439 align:start position:0%
of parking in New Hampshire in your
 
03:10:36.110 --> 03:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
opinion which is the greater societal
 
03:10:38.190 --> 03:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
harm a New Hampshire that doesn't have
 
03:10:39.870 --> 03:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
enough housing or a New Hampshire that
 
03:10:41.349 --> 03:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't have enough
 
03:10:43.309 --> 03:10:43.319 align:start position:0%
parking at New Hampshire where there's
 
03:10:44.910 --> 03:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
not enough housing we are number one in
 
03:10:46.349 --> 03:10:46.359 align:start position:0%
the increase of homelessness in the
 
03:10:47.790 --> 03:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
state so we should be doing anything to
 
03:10:51.469 --> 03:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:53.349 --> 03:10:53.359 align:start position:0%
that other
 
03:10:56.070 --> 03:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
questions seean thank you thank you take
 
03:11:08.229 --> 03:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.710 --> 03:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:16.110 --> 03:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
back CH no place I'd rather be uh thank
 
03:11:17.870 --> 03:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
you so much for letting me tell justify
 
03:11:22.190 --> 03:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
I am no surprise in support of this bill
 
03:11:23.630 --> 03:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh for all the reasons that people
 
03:11:25.950 --> 03:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
already said but the one thing that I
 
03:11:29.830 --> 03:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
would like to remind you of is that the
 
03:11:31.550 --> 03:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
Institute of Traffic Engineers who
 
03:11:33.550 --> 03:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
created all those lovely tables that
 
03:11:35.630 --> 03:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
tell you how many parking places you
 
03:11:37.630 --> 03:11:37.640 align:start position:0%
need for your swimming pool based on how
 
03:11:40.269 --> 03:11:40.279 align:start position:0%
many gallons it has in it for a public
 
03:11:42.710 --> 03:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
pool admitted about 10 years ago that
 
03:11:45.550 --> 03:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
basically they made those numbers up so
 
03:11:49.269 --> 03:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of this the rules around how much
 
03:11:52.710 --> 03:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
parking do we need for what are based on
 
03:11:55.389 --> 03:11:55.399 align:start position:0%
nothing and the other thing I'd remind
 
03:11:58.229 --> 03:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
the committee of is that many many many
 
03:12:00.389 --> 03:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions in the United States have
 
03:12:02.870 --> 03:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
already eliminated their parking
 
03:12:04.910 --> 03:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
requirements which does not as
 
03:12:07.710 --> 03:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
previously noted eliminate parking seab
 
03:12:09.790 --> 03:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
Brook New Hampshire is one of them by
 
03:12:11.990 --> 03:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
the way and a lot of them are small
 
03:12:15.870 --> 03:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
places that don't have a robust public
 
03:12:18.150 --> 03:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
transportation the other thing that to
 
03:12:19.870 --> 03:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
remind you of when you think about
 
03:12:23.389 --> 03:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
parking and housing is that almost
 
03:12:26.190 --> 03:12:26.200 align:start position:0%
onethird of houses nearly one-third of
 
03:12:28.349 --> 03:12:28.359 align:start position:0%
households in the United States and in
 
03:12:33.990 --> 03:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are one person one one one
 
03:12:36.349 --> 03:12:36.359 align:start position:0%
we don't need two parking places for
 
03:12:40.150 --> 03:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
every housing unit and quite
 
03:12:44.630 --> 03:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
frankly as people do move a little bit
 
03:12:47.190 --> 03:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
away from Cars I'm not suggesting that
 
03:12:48.190 --> 03:12:48.200 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire are going to
 
03:12:49.790 --> 03:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
give up cars we all know we need a car
 
03:12:51.870 --> 03:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
to get around
 
03:12:54.910 --> 03:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
however lots of households are figuring
 
03:12:58.510 --> 03:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
out that cars are expensive I've
 
03:13:00.190 --> 03:13:00.200 align:start position:0%
forgotten now what the number is what it
 
03:13:02.830 --> 03:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
costs annually to operate a car and
 
03:13:05.389 --> 03:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
insure it and maintain it never mind
 
03:13:06.910 --> 03:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
whether you've already paid for it or
 
03:13:09.349 --> 03:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
not but it's an expensive it's an
 
03:13:12.070 --> 03:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
expensive proposition and when we
 
03:13:15.229 --> 03:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
require more parking for everything we
 
03:13:17.150 --> 03:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
spread everything out further which
 
03:13:19.110 --> 03:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
means that people have to have cars
 
03:13:20.670 --> 03:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
because things are spread out farther
 
03:13:22.030 --> 03:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
and then we have to have parking for the
 
03:13:25.389 --> 03:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
cars and it's a death spiral let's not
 
03:13:28.510 --> 03:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
um and what we're seeing in the planning
 
03:13:31.990 --> 03:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
world is that uh households are
 
03:13:35.309 --> 03:13:35.319 align:start position:0%
beginning to swap over to one
 
03:13:39.229 --> 03:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
car and maybe an electric bicycle or one
 
03:13:42.469 --> 03:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
car and not anything else because people
 
03:13:45.750 --> 03:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
are working from home so I think that
 
03:13:48.950 --> 03:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
the idea that we know how much parking
 
03:13:51.590 --> 03:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
is necessary and that the amateur
 
03:13:53.469 --> 03:13:53.479 align:start position:0%
planning boards of New Hampshire and
 
03:13:55.269 --> 03:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
they are lovely people and they work
 
03:13:59.150 --> 03:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
really hard no we're really bad at
 
03:14:00.670 --> 03:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
figuring out how much parking is
 
03:14:02.790 --> 03:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
necessary I think we should stop trying
 
03:14:06.670 --> 03:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
to do that and particularly in the to
 
03:14:08.110 --> 03:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
answer the question of what do we need
 
03:14:11.030 --> 03:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
more of parking or housing it's not
 
03:14:14.389 --> 03:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
parking and I'm happy to take questions
 
03:14:17.830 --> 03:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you miss van are there questions
 
03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
super I'll be back next week I'm sure
 
03:14:22.389 --> 03:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
see you
 
03:14:37.229 --> 03:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:40.269 --> 03:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
Marie good afternoon chairman Alexander
 
03:14:41.790 --> 03:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
03:14:44.150 --> 03:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
Grace Murray and I'm testifying in
 
03:14:47.990 --> 03:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
support of HB 382
 
03:14:49.269 --> 03:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
um I work with New Hampshire youth
 
03:14:51.150 --> 03:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
movement as the political director and
 
03:14:53.309 --> 03:14:53.319 align:start position:0%
we're a movement of young people across
 
03:14:55.030 --> 03:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that focus on
 
03:14:56.830 --> 03:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
issues that youth care about and one of
 
03:14:58.150 --> 03:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
the biggest issues that youth care about
 
03:15:00.950 --> 03:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
right now is housing and more
 
03:15:03.229 --> 03:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
specifically the lack of
 
03:15:05.389 --> 03:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
it um I'll also be emailing the
 
03:15:06.670 --> 03:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
committee with informational with an
 
03:15:08.550 --> 03:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
infoi with uh the sources that I'll be
 
03:15:08.560 --> 03:15:09.910 align:start position:0%
infoi with uh the sources that I'll be
citing

03:15:09.910 --> 03:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
citing
 
03:15:11.830 --> 03:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
today we all know that New Hampshire is
 
03:15:13.590 --> 03:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
facing a housing shortage on top of
 
03:15:16.309 --> 03:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
prices also being astronomical many
 
03:15:17.710 --> 03:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
state and city governments are
 
03:15:19.189 --> 03:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
considering or have already removed
 
03:15:21.590 --> 03:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
parking mandates to allow Property
 
03:15:23.110 --> 03:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
Owners to choose for themselves whether
 
03:15:25.469 --> 03:15:25.479 align:start position:0%
to build parking or the amount to
 
03:15:27.870 --> 03:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
build this policy change has been shown
 
03:15:29.150 --> 03:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
to significantly increase the
 
03:15:31.189 --> 03:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
feasibility of building more homes and
 
03:15:32.950 --> 03:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
also reduce the cost of building those
 
03:15:35.030 --> 03:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
homes by removing unnecessary
 
03:15:38.630 --> 03:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
restrictions with a vacancy rate of 6%
 
03:15:40.750 --> 03:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it's time for some
 
03:15:42.870 --> 03:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
robust legislation to address this issue
 
03:15:45.229 --> 03:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
that affects the thousands of gr uh
 
03:15:46.990 --> 03:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
homeless gr estaters and also just
 
03:15:48.229 --> 03:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
housing secure granted Staters and
 
03:15:49.870 --> 03:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
anyone who just can't find
 
03:15:52.590 --> 03:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
housing by removing parking uh mandatory
 
03:15:54.630 --> 03:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
parking minimum Statewide we can address
 
03:15:56.670 --> 03:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
problems like the lack of supply and
 
03:15:58.590 --> 03:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
high C cost of housing while also
 
03:16:01.389 --> 03:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
allowing Property Owners to have uh to
 
03:16:03.150 --> 03:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
strategically determine how many parking
 
03:16:05.710 --> 03:16:05.720 align:start position:0%
spaces should be built removing parking
 
03:16:07.229 --> 03:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
minimums has already been proven to Be
 
03:16:09.389 --> 03:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
an Effective tool across the country and
 
03:16:14.189 --> 03:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities in our state um HB 382 is
 
03:16:16.309 --> 03:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
solid bipartison legislation that will
 
03:16:17.870 --> 03:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
positively imp impact residents across
 
03:16:19.830 --> 03:16:19.840 align:start position:0%

about to
 
03:17:17.110 --> 03:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
say um if you've ever read some of the
 
03:17:20.590 --> 03:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
stuff about quantum mechanics recently U
 
03:17:22.630 --> 03:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
entanglement means everything's
 
03:17:24.870 --> 03:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
connected and when you try to plan
 
03:17:26.870 --> 03:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
something at the local level you have to
 
03:17:29.389 --> 03:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
take all of all the other things into
 
03:17:31.950 --> 03:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
consideration so every Community every
 
03:17:35.110 --> 03:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
municipality has the ability with a
 
03:17:37.030 --> 03:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
vision of its people and the input of
 
03:17:39.429 --> 03:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
its people to create a master plan for
 
03:17:44.150 --> 03:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
the town land use land use Master
 
03:17:47.389 --> 03:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
planning and at the same time
 
03:17:48.990 --> 03:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
we all know we need
 
03:17:51.510 --> 03:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
housing housing needs
 
03:17:54.150 --> 03:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
density density needs
 
03:17:56.389 --> 03:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
Wastewater the Wastewater Grant
 
03:17:58.750 --> 03:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
requirements uh say that you have to
 
03:18:00.870 --> 03:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
have an engineer Consulting engineer
 
03:18:04.229 --> 03:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
hired by the municipality to study the
 
03:18:06.950 --> 03:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
master plan of the water Wastewater for
 
03:18:09.550 --> 03:18:09.560 align:start position:0%
water protection for for the delivery of
 
03:18:13.030 --> 03:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
clean drinking water so that Master Plan
 
03:18:15.229 --> 03:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
has to blend in with the master plan
 
03:18:17.910 --> 03:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
vision of the town on the the land
 
03:18:20.950 --> 03:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
use when you take away a tool in the
 
03:18:24.469 --> 03:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
toolbox of planning at the local level
 
03:18:27.510 --> 03:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
you pit one of those against the other
 
03:18:30.189 --> 03:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
and I'll give you an example uh the
 
03:18:32.189 --> 03:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
selectman just sent me a message to
 
03:18:35.229 --> 03:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
relay to you if I if I might uh in
 
03:18:38.630 --> 03:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill um prior Speaker
 
03:18:40.189 --> 03:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
of the House jeene Chandler is a
 
03:18:43.389 --> 03:18:43.399 align:start position:0%
selectman there he signed it um the
 
03:18:44.790 --> 03:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
chairman of the planning board in
 
03:18:48.469 --> 03:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
Bartlett signed it um I got a gentleman
 
03:18:51.750 --> 03:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
Richard plush from U uh Zoning Board of
 
03:18:54.750 --> 03:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
adjustments in Bartlett for 30 years and
 
03:18:56.630 --> 03:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
he sent me an email and I'll forward
 
03:19:00.870 --> 03:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
those to you on online
 
03:19:05.070 --> 03:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
um the Bartlett doesn't think that U the
 
03:19:07.469 --> 03:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
Town of Bartlett and his people do not
 
03:19:10.110 --> 03:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
think that uh what's good for Manchester
 
03:19:12.790 --> 03:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
is good for Bartlet and that would apply
 
03:19:13.870 --> 03:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
to every
 
03:19:16.790 --> 03:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
municipality the real wisdom of of
 
03:19:20.229 --> 03:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities at is at the local level
 
03:19:23.070 --> 03:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
now if we have a a problem with parking
 
03:19:26.229 --> 03:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
think about how you might enable more to
 
03:19:29.269 --> 03:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
be flexible on that level don't take
 
03:19:31.429 --> 03:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
away the rights of the people in the
 
03:19:34.750 --> 03:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
toolbox to plan where parking should be
 
03:19:37.229 --> 03:19:37.239 align:start position:0%
as it's compatible with the master
 
03:19:39.950 --> 03:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
plan Mount Washington Valley is being
 
03:19:42.349 --> 03:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
inundated with Humanity because it's one
 
03:19:45.469 --> 03:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
of the small best small ski Towns now in
 
03:19:48.510 --> 03:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
America and we're losing all our
 
03:19:51.150 --> 03:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
families we're losing Workforce housing
 
03:19:53.070 --> 03:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
uh people with money are coming in
 
03:19:55.070 --> 03:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
buying up the housing a lot of New
 
03:19:56.750 --> 03:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has face that sort of thing
 
03:19:58.590 --> 03:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
that's part of what the housing crisis
 
03:20:01.150 --> 03:20:01.160 align:start position:0%
is how do we create housing for families
 
03:20:05.150 --> 03:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
for residents for full-time people so in
 
03:20:07.910 --> 03:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
Bartlett they're uh looking towards
 
03:20:11.990 --> 03:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
getting a in law a position where lore
 
03:20:14.389 --> 03:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
Bartlet which is which is a sub Precinct
 
03:20:17.429 --> 03:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
a subgovernment entity of the state uh
 
03:20:19.950 --> 03:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
about to build a $20 million Wastewater
 
03:20:22.150 --> 03:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
facility that's going to go into North
 
03:20:24.469 --> 03:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
Conway water precincts treatment
 
03:20:27.750 --> 03:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
facility and they're opposing for any
 
03:20:31.469 --> 03:20:31.479 align:start position:0%
sewer to go up into Bartlet why they
 
03:20:33.910 --> 03:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
don't want waste water to go by because
 
03:20:36.309 --> 03:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
it means they now have growth imposed
 
03:20:38.590 --> 03:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
upon them that they wouldn't have if
 
03:20:39.950 --> 03:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
they didn't have
 
03:20:42.389 --> 03:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
Wastewater and so it's an easy way to
 
03:20:44.790 --> 03:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
stop population from coming in and stop
 
03:20:47.510 --> 03:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
housing by denying Wastewater
 
03:20:50.389 --> 03:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
that un that's an unintended
 
03:20:52.710 --> 03:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
consequence all of that can be sorted
 
03:20:55.030 --> 03:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
out locally and we all know how hard it
 
03:20:58.429 --> 03:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
is to come together locally uh that in
 
03:21:00.510 --> 03:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
itself is quite an
 
03:21:02.750 --> 03:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
accomplishment um and we're about to
 
03:21:04.670 --> 03:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
face that because the town of Conway
 
03:21:06.429 --> 03:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
just took over Conway Village fire
 
03:21:09.030 --> 03:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
District's water system so for the first
 
03:21:10.870 --> 03:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
time the town of Conway will be in the
 
03:21:13.030 --> 03:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
Water Business and we're trying to
 
03:21:15.429 --> 03:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
expand the town of Conway's Wastewater
 
03:21:17.670 --> 03:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
out into areas where the master plan
 
03:21:19.429 --> 03:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
said housing should be
 
03:21:23.030 --> 03:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
located so now now housing and planning
 
03:21:25.630 --> 03:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
becomes a tool for how we get and this
 
03:21:28.269 --> 03:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
is a test a 2third bond boat to build
 
03:21:31.510 --> 03:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
that Wastewater so if we want housing we
 
03:21:34.030 --> 03:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
really need to uh keep keep our planning
 
03:21:37.150 --> 03:21:37.160 align:start position:0%
local and and now educate our our local
 
03:21:39.389 --> 03:21:39.399 align:start position:0%
people all the citizens and all the
 
03:21:41.670 --> 03:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
elected officials how to work together
 
03:21:45.110 --> 03:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
and unentangled things but considering
 
03:21:47.110 --> 03:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
the entanglement of everything
 
03:21:49.750 --> 03:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's quite a quite a thing so please
 
03:21:52.630 --> 03:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
don't uh don't take away the rights of
 
03:21:54.950 --> 03:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
to to locate where people will park when
 
03:21:57.670 --> 03:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
they build these housing take away the
 
03:21:59.990 --> 03:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
rights of the planning to locate where
 
03:22:02.550 --> 03:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
parking locks should be uh for
 
03:22:04.630 --> 03:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
commercial especially when they're
 
03:22:07.670 --> 03:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
considering the the parking runoff and
 
03:22:10.189 --> 03:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
we're trying to protect the water so we
 
03:22:12.469 --> 03:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
can get the people in the housing it's
 
03:22:15.950 --> 03:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
all intertangled so I strongly oppose
 
03:22:18.550 --> 03:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
anything you do here that would weaken
 
03:22:20.630 --> 03:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
planning on the local level and thank
 
03:22:22.710 --> 03:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
you very much for giving me this much
 
03:22:25.510 --> 03:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
time Mr chairman not a problem any
 
03:22:27.389 --> 03:22:27.399 align:start position:0%
questions we have a question if you
 
03:22:30.590 --> 03:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
don't mind sir Miss HBO um
 
03:22:33.189 --> 03:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you Mr chair
 
03:22:34.590 --> 03:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you for coming this morning
 
03:22:37.870 --> 03:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
this afternoon to testify um but I do
 
03:22:41.550 --> 03:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
have a question uh and that is how would
 
03:22:43.790 --> 03:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
eliminating Municipal parking
 
03:22:46.189 --> 03:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
requirements interfere with Wastewater
 
03:22:48.309 --> 03:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
process processing and the availability
 
03:22:50.349 --> 03:22:50.359 align:start position:0%
of clean drinking
 
03:22:53.710 --> 03:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
water well when you try to in a in the
 
03:22:56.670 --> 03:22:56.680 align:start position:0%
vision of a master plan uh locate where
 
03:22:59.389 --> 03:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
you want housing or where you want
 
03:23:01.590 --> 03:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
business you have a res uh commercial
 
03:23:05.110 --> 03:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
zones residential zones um you you take
 
03:23:08.710 --> 03:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
into account through site plan review uh
 
03:23:10.630 --> 03:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
how much parking that business is going
 
03:23:12.469 --> 03:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
to need how much parking the
 
03:23:14.950 --> 03:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
residential's going to need uh to not to
 
03:23:16.910 --> 03:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
take that into consider it the local
 
03:23:19.269 --> 03:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
level as part of where where the plan
 
03:23:22.269 --> 03:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
master plan says that should be located
 
03:23:25.229 --> 03:23:25.239 align:start position:0%
causes a dilemma because now it
 
03:23:27.469 --> 03:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
intertwines with transportation and in
 
03:23:29.830 --> 03:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
North Conway Mount Washington Valley if
 
03:23:32.790 --> 03:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
you've ever been up there you it goes
 
03:23:36.590 --> 03:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
from a population of 15,000 to 36,000
 
03:23:40.309 --> 03:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
overnight on a Friday night uh you you
 
03:23:42.110 --> 03:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
can't really get through there it's
 
03:23:44.189 --> 03:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
backed up now they were going to build a
 
03:23:46.229 --> 03:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
bypass but they didn't the state pulled
 
03:23:48.469 --> 03:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
out because the bypass was going to be
 
03:23:50.590 --> 03:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
built to go to Berlin and gorm but then
 
03:23:52.510 --> 03:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
they found that the that wasn't a
 
03:23:54.590 --> 03:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
problem the destination point was North
 
03:23:56.710 --> 03:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
Conway they didn't go beyond so they
 
03:23:59.110 --> 03:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
pulled out and didn't build the bypass
 
03:24:02.550 --> 03:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
so now we got a mini bypass dumping onto
 
03:24:03.950 --> 03:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
our side streets and into our
 
03:24:06.189 --> 03:24:06.199 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods we we have quite a
 
03:24:08.189 --> 03:24:08.199 align:start position:0%
transportation dilemma that has to be
 
03:24:11.349 --> 03:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
sorted out with parking and parking is
 
03:24:13.030 --> 03:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
an integral part of all of that
 
03:24:15.030 --> 03:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation part
 
03:24:20.670 --> 03:24:20.680 align:start position:0%
also go go ahead go ahead thank you uh
 
03:24:23.750 --> 03:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
but wouldn't that um allow for as
 
03:24:26.189 --> 03:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
representative uh as chairman Alexander
 
03:24:29.469 --> 03:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
said earlier wouldn't couldn't those uh
 
03:24:32.870 --> 03:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
parking requirements be used uh for
 
03:24:34.510 --> 03:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
reasons that have actually nothing to do
 
03:24:38.070 --> 03:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
with parking but rather to uh keep out
 
03:24:40.229 --> 03:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
of the municipality certain types of
 
03:24:42.750 --> 03:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
housing for for totally other
 
03:24:45.510 --> 03:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
reasons no I think it would work in the
 
03:24:47.670 --> 03:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
opposite fashion the real Challenge on
 
03:24:50.910 --> 03:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
planning is to have people understand it
 
03:24:52.790 --> 03:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
come together and realize where parking
 
03:24:54.910 --> 03:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
should be as it intertwines in in
 
03:24:58.070 --> 03:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
transportation and water and housing and
 
03:25:00.630 --> 03:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
that that thoughtful planning uh it
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
takes an awful lot of citizen
 
03:25:05.389 --> 03:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
participation understanding if you if
 
03:25:07.269 --> 03:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
you take away the tool that allows them
 
03:25:10.070 --> 03:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
to do that by saying parking you no
 
03:25:13.269 --> 03:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
longer can control that centralized
 
03:25:15.150 --> 03:25:15.160 align:start position:0%
approach down here in conquer isn't
 
03:25:17.150 --> 03:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
going to work it isn't going to work for
 
03:25:21.389 --> 03:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
Manchester or North Conway or or any
 
03:25:23.510 --> 03:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
towns in the especially the rural parts
 
03:25:26.309 --> 03:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so I think if if
 
03:25:28.710 --> 03:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester is looking at u a problem
 
03:25:31.150 --> 03:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
with parking we we ought to look at what
 
03:25:33.429 --> 03:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
flexibil what more flexibility can we
 
03:25:36.550 --> 03:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
give Manchester give them more tools uh
 
03:25:38.309 --> 03:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
but don't take away the tools of all the
 
03:25:40.309 --> 03:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
other municipalities that need to look
 
03:25:42.990 --> 03:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
at their own plans individually and most
 
03:25:45.030 --> 03:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
of the knowledge to accomplish that is
 
03:25:48.189 --> 03:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
at the local level
 
03:25:50.110 --> 03:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
thank you I hope I hope that answered
 
03:25:52.710 --> 03:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
your question or at least gave you my
 
03:25:54.590 --> 03:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
point of view of the answer to that
 
03:25:57.389 --> 03:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
question all right other questions
 
03:25:59.830 --> 03:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you is there anyone
 
03:26:02.750 --> 03:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
else here to testify on House Bill
 
03:26:04.990 --> 03:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
382 seeing none I'm going to close that
 
03:26:08.150 --> 03:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
public hearing um I was going to
 
03:26:25.950 --> 03:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:27.349 --> 03:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
and now I'm going to open up the public
 
03:26:31.750 --> 03:26:31.760 align:start position:0%

sponsor and uh representative you can
 
03:26:40.870 --> 03:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
fill out a bin card after that'd be
 
03:26:43.590 --> 03:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
great I will I will thank you Mr chair
 
03:26:46.630 --> 03:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
and thank you honorable members um for
 
03:26:49.269 --> 03:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
the record my name is still Ellen Reed
 
03:26:51.510 --> 03:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
and I still represent Rockingham 10 new
 
03:26:54.990 --> 03:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:57.510 --> 03:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
newfields as in many of your
 
03:27:01.389 --> 03:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
towns I have quite a number of renters
 
03:27:02.830 --> 03:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
who come to
 
03:27:06.910 --> 03:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
me with oh my God my landlord whether a
 
03:27:09.110 --> 03:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
new landlord that bought the property
 
03:27:11.510 --> 03:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
without anybody knowing or the same
 
03:27:14.269 --> 03:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
landlord my landlord has just raised the
 
03:27:17.670 --> 03:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
rent 200%
 
03:27:21.150 --> 03:27:21.160 align:start position:0%
250% it went from a th000 to 2,000 or,
 
03:27:24.469 --> 03:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
1500 to 3,000 what do I
 
03:27:28.070 --> 03:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
do and whenever these landlords pretty
 
03:27:30.590 --> 03:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
much without exception are questioned
 
03:27:32.550 --> 03:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
why did you your costs couldn't have
 
03:27:34.389 --> 03:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
gone up that
 
03:27:37.309 --> 03:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
much right the your pro we know how much
 
03:27:38.870 --> 03:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
property tax you're paying we know how
 
03:27:41.389 --> 03:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
much this and that you're paying and you
 
03:27:42.830 --> 03:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
know you may have slapped a coat of
 
03:27:45.269 --> 03:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
millennial gray on the walls but you
 
03:27:46.630 --> 03:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
know you didn't do
 
03:27:50.229 --> 03:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
substantive like you know renovation
 
03:27:52.550 --> 03:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
that would actually mandate this kind of
 
03:27:54.510 --> 03:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
rent increase what why are you raising
 
03:27:57.269 --> 03:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
the rent this much and almost without
 
03:28:00.710 --> 03:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
fail the answer is the same that's the
 
03:28:00.720 --> 03:28:03.790 align:start position:0%
fail the answer is the same that's the
market

03:28:03.790 --> 03:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:07.309 --> 03:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
rate who is making this Market who's
 
03:28:09.349 --> 03:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
making the market because this landlord
 
03:28:11.070 --> 03:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
blames that one and that one blames this
 
03:28:12.590 --> 03:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
one and they're all just going up
 
03:28:14.910 --> 03:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
together and there is a pattern when you
 
03:28:16.630 --> 03:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
see this happen and basically Bally any
 
03:28:19.429 --> 03:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
industry and it usually correlates with
 
03:28:22.309 --> 03:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
a practice an illegal practice a immoral
 
03:28:25.870 --> 03:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
practice that we call price
 
03:28:25.880 --> 03:28:27.429 align:start position:0%
practice that we call price
fixing

03:28:27.429 --> 03:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
fixing
 
03:28:30.070 --> 03:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
so price fixing for anyone who's taken
 
03:28:32.630 --> 03:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
econ 101 is
 
03:28:37.110 --> 03:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
anathema the Enemy Number One really of
 
03:28:41.309 --> 03:28:41.319 align:start position:0%
the free market capitalist system now it
 
03:28:42.870 --> 03:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
may not surprise any of you I don't
 
03:28:44.790 --> 03:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
identify as a free market capitalist
 
03:28:47.630 --> 03:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
however I did take e 101 and and other
 
03:28:50.229 --> 03:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
class and other courses in my in my
 
03:28:53.870 --> 03:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
Master's Degree uh and you can't price
 
03:28:57.150 --> 03:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
fix and have a free market capitalist
 
03:29:00.070 --> 03:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
Society because it absolutely undercuts
 
03:29:02.670 --> 03:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
the idea of competition what it means is
 
03:29:06.030 --> 03:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
that one half of that supply and demand
 
03:29:08.870 --> 03:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
equation has gotten together and
 
03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
prevented competition by unilaterally
 
03:29:14.389 --> 03:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
raising the price so that you don't have
 
03:29:16.710 --> 03:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
options anymore as the consumer as the
 
03:29:18.309 --> 03:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
demand side you don't get to make
 
03:29:21.070 --> 03:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
choices based on who is doing better and
 
03:29:22.510 --> 03:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
who's offering the better goods and
 
03:29:24.670 --> 03:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
services at the better price it
 
03:29:27.830 --> 03:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely takes away the invisible hand
 
03:29:30.110 --> 03:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
concept of the free
 
03:29:34.510 --> 03:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
market we can't monitor what's happening
 
03:29:37.110 --> 03:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
unlike the insurance industry or the
 
03:29:39.590 --> 03:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
energy industry or any of any number of
 
03:29:42.950 --> 03:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
other Industries we don't have data we
 
03:29:44.670 --> 03:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
don't have a centralized source of
 
03:29:49.590 --> 03:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
reliable data for what rents are we have
 
03:29:51.110 --> 03:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:29:54.670 --> 03:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
basically uh what people are reporting
 
03:29:56.550 --> 03:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
but we don't have one centralized source
 
03:30:00.590 --> 03:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:04.110 --> 03:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
data so what this bill would do would be
 
03:30:07.710 --> 03:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
to ask the register of deeds for each
 
03:30:11.870 --> 03:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
County to create a um method which I
 
03:30:13.590 --> 03:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
imagine most of them would create an
 
03:30:16.389 --> 03:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
online portal because that would be a
 
03:30:19.349 --> 03:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
very small amount of upfront labor
 
03:30:22.189 --> 03:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
followed by not a lot of more labor
 
03:30:26.590 --> 03:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
after that by which they intake
 
03:30:28.510 --> 03:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
information from every landlord who's
 
03:30:31.469 --> 03:30:31.479 align:start position:0%
renting a property in the county and
 
03:30:33.590 --> 03:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
that landlord will supply and the onus
 
03:30:37.189 --> 03:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
is on the landlord to supply yearly by
 
03:30:41.189 --> 03:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
December 31st their rental amount the
 
03:30:43.550 --> 03:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
location the bedrooms bathrooms the
 
03:30:46.110 --> 03:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
amenities so that we have a a
 
03:30:48.229 --> 03:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
centralized source of data that we can
 
03:30:50.389 --> 03:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
then study the market because this is
 
03:30:53.189 --> 03:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
the biggest crisis in the in the state
 
03:30:56.189 --> 03:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the data that we
 
03:30:58.910 --> 03:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
need I don't know how we we are
 
03:31:01.550 --> 03:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
completely unserious about the housing
 
03:31:04.389 --> 03:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
crisis if we don't even want the
 
03:31:07.070 --> 03:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
information to study what the heck is
 
03:31:07.080 --> 03:31:10.630 align:start position:0%
information to study what the heck is
going

03:31:10.630 --> 03:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:10.640 --> 03:31:14.469 align:start position:0%
 
on

03:31:14.469 --> 03:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:17.269 --> 03:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
so um I understand that some of the push
 
03:31:18.429 --> 03:31:18.439 align:start position:0%
back and there's a second part of the
 
03:31:20.269 --> 03:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
bill that I'll get to I understand that
 
03:31:24.150 --> 03:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
some of the push back um from the
 
03:31:26.710 --> 03:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
majority maybe of the register of deeds
 
03:31:29.269 --> 03:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
I have privately from two Register of
 
03:31:31.429 --> 03:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
Deeds personal opinions that they are in
 
03:31:32.830 --> 03:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
support of this
 
03:31:37.590 --> 03:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
concept um but as a whole I understand
 
03:31:39.150 --> 03:31:39.160 align:start position:0%
the push back as is the push back
 
03:31:41.830 --> 03:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
anytime we do anything with any
 
03:31:45.550 --> 03:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
department or municipality generally
 
03:31:47.510 --> 03:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
these government entities that we kind
 
03:31:50.030 --> 03:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
of oversee don't like to be told what to
 
03:31:52.349 --> 03:31:52.359 align:start position:0%
do they don't like extra
 
03:31:55.750 --> 03:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
work so I get it it happens on every
 
03:31:57.990 --> 03:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
single Bill where we try to do anything
 
03:32:00.189 --> 03:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
but this is a very minor amount of extra
 
03:32:03.590 --> 03:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
work at most at most for the irre if you
 
03:32:05.110 --> 03:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
set up an online portal there's The
 
03:32:08.990 --> 03:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
Upfront cost and then you might maybe in
 
03:32:12.870 --> 03:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
December hire a part-time short-term
 
03:32:15.389 --> 03:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
extra help maybe but I honestly think
 
03:32:17.710 --> 03:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
any regularities in the reporting
 
03:32:19.990 --> 03:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
process probably could be
 
03:32:25.030 --> 03:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:27.590 --> 03:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
contrary but it's a small amount of
 
03:32:29.469 --> 03:32:29.479 align:start position:0%
extra work but what we get out of it is
 
03:32:32.630 --> 03:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
so valuable because now we get to see
 
03:32:35.349 --> 03:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
okay you raised the rents because this
 
03:32:36.830 --> 03:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
other landlord raised the rent because
 
03:32:38.670 --> 03:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
it's now it's the market so who was the
 
03:32:39.910 --> 03:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
person who started raising the rent and
 
03:32:41.309 --> 03:32:41.319 align:start position:0%
did they have a reason to raise the rent
 
03:32:43.750 --> 03:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
we can actually study this Market that
 
03:32:45.870 --> 03:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
all the landlords are blaming for this
 
03:32:48.070 --> 03:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
this ever increasing rental rates that
 
03:32:50.429 --> 03:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
are pushing out all of our workers and I
 
03:32:52.309 --> 03:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
know I've said this before and I know
 
03:32:53.670 --> 03:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
I'm probably going to say it again in
 
03:32:56.070 --> 03:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
this committee we are pushing out the
 
03:32:58.830 --> 03:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
people that we need here the working age
 
03:33:01.469 --> 03:33:01.479 align:start position:0%
Working Class People are leaving I had
 
03:33:04.309 --> 03:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
multiple dozens of people in New Market
 
03:33:06.510 --> 03:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
when we had a landlord buy and triple
 
03:33:09.469 --> 03:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
the rent leave not just New Market where
 
03:33:11.790 --> 03:33:11.800 align:start position:0%
they made our food and did all the s
 
03:33:13.269 --> 03:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
they delivered our mail three of them
 
03:33:17.830 --> 03:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:19.910 --> 03:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
in 20 years we will not have enough
 
03:33:22.790 --> 03:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
nurses working here to take care of all
 
03:33:24.910 --> 03:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
the people in nursing homes this should
 
03:33:28.070 --> 03:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:31.229 --> 03:33:31.239 align:start position:0%
call so the data we're getting from this
 
03:33:33.429 --> 03:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
for the amount of work we're adding the
 
03:33:37.469 --> 03:33:37.479 align:start position:0%
data is super vital super
 
03:33:40.990 --> 03:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
important now in addition there is an
 
03:33:42.990 --> 03:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
affidavit on this form that the landlord
 
03:33:44.630 --> 03:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
would have to sign on the online portal
 
03:33:47.550 --> 03:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
or whatever saying that they do not use
 
03:33:50.150 --> 03:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
software to determine a rent now we can
 
03:33:51.349 --> 03:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
talk about the wording I think the
 
03:33:54.389 --> 03:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
intense is clear somebody emailed the
 
03:33:55.750 --> 03:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
committee and said well what about
 
03:33:57.590 --> 03:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets and like that's not the
 
03:33:59.990 --> 03:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet has never told me what to do
 
03:34:02.150 --> 03:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
I look at the data in a spreadsheet
 
03:34:03.710 --> 03:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
however what that's referencing is a
 
03:34:06.389 --> 03:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
very real problem an institution an
 
03:34:08.110 --> 03:34:08.120 align:start position:0%
organization of business called real
 
03:34:10.870 --> 03:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
page which has been under lawsuit from
 
03:34:13.389 --> 03:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
the federal government for price fixing
 
03:34:16.469 --> 03:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
because price fixing isn't just to
 
03:34:20.110 --> 03:34:20.120 align:start position:0%
people to sellers to suppliers in the
 
03:34:23.110 --> 03:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
supply demand privately having a
 
03:34:25.710 --> 03:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
conversation it can be a de facto price
 
03:34:28.150 --> 03:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
fix where you're using a a software an
 
03:34:30.469 --> 03:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
algorithm to communicate between all of
 
03:34:32.389 --> 03:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
us and that's exactly what real page has
 
03:34:35.590 --> 03:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
been doing and well over 95% of the
 
03:34:38.750 --> 03:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
large landlords use real
 
03:34:41.790 --> 03:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
page so I understand that with real page
 
03:34:43.590 --> 03:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
being sued there may be other
 
03:34:46.070 --> 03:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
alternative systems that will operate
 
03:34:47.750 --> 03:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
and function like real
 
03:34:50.590 --> 03:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
page if this committee decides to amend
 
03:34:52.070 --> 03:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
this out so we get rid of the data
 
03:34:54.070 --> 03:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
collection and just say hey you can't
 
03:34:56.590 --> 03:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
price fix through an algorithm that's
 
03:34:59.790 --> 03:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
fine whatever whatever step in the right
 
03:35:02.269 --> 03:35:02.279 align:start position:0%
direction uh that we take but I will say
 
03:35:04.590 --> 03:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
that data collection is very important
 
03:35:07.670 --> 03:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
if we um can see our way to to keeping
 
03:35:10.389 --> 03:35:10.399 align:start position:0%
that in so some of the arguments you may
 
03:35:13.269 --> 03:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
hear there's a um as with most
 
03:35:16.189 --> 03:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
legislation that does not uh
 
03:35:19.670 --> 03:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh create a a criminal offense there's a
 
03:35:22.469 --> 03:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
60-day enactment so a 60 days after
 
03:35:25.349 --> 03:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
being signed it goes into effect perhaps
 
03:35:27.110 --> 03:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
some registers of Deeds are worried that
 
03:35:28.269 --> 03:35:28.279 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be able to implement this
 
03:35:30.630 --> 03:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
in 60 days they don't have to it would
 
03:35:32.349 --> 03:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
get signed in the summer and the first
 
03:35:33.910 --> 03:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
deadline for landlord's reporting is
 
03:35:36.349 --> 03:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
December 31st so they have six
 
03:35:40.150 --> 03:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
months to get up a portal a website that
 
03:35:43.030 --> 03:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
says here's the information we want um
 
03:35:46.030 --> 03:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
another thing is they're worried that
 
03:35:48.189 --> 03:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be able to enforce these
 
03:35:50.870 --> 03:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
landlords submitting this information
 
03:35:54.030 --> 03:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
it's not their job like most of landlord
 
03:35:56.790 --> 03:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
law we don't have like a real
 
03:35:56.800 --> 03:35:58.469 align:start position:0%
law we don't have like a real
enforcement

03:35:58.469 --> 03:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
03:36:01.229 --> 03:36:01.239 align:start position:0%
organization it's literally if you
 
03:36:02.990 --> 03:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
happen to know a landlord or if your
 
03:36:05.790 --> 03:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
landlord is breaking the law you file a
 
03:36:07.870 --> 03:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
complaint the cops don't show up at the
 
03:36:10.110 --> 03:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
landlord's door and arrest
 
03:36:12.389 --> 03:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
him you just file a complaint and you
 
03:36:16.189 --> 03:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
take it to court so the county
 
03:36:17.550 --> 03:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
has really nothing to do with the
 
03:36:19.269 --> 03:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement they are just collecting the
 
03:36:21.030 --> 03:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
data and making it publicly available
 
03:36:21.040 --> 03:36:23.550 align:start position:0%
data and making it publicly available
for

03:36:23.550 --> 03:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:26.830 --> 03:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
everybody so anyway yeah uh price fixing
 
03:36:28.830 --> 03:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
should be illegal it's anathema to our
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
system it's creating a housing crisis
 
03:36:34.030 --> 03:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
and uh this is just data Gathering it's
 
03:36:35.550 --> 03:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
a very small amount of work for a very
 
03:36:37.510 --> 03:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
large payoff but even if you don't do
 
03:36:39.790 --> 03:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
that we should definitely make it clear
 
03:36:41.750 --> 03:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
that price fixing via algorithm is
 
03:36:43.750 --> 03:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
illegal and that is my testimony I'm
 
03:36:45.870 --> 03:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions well thank you
 
03:36:48.070 --> 03:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative reader their
 
03:36:51.950 --> 03:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
questions cool right seeing none thank
 
03:37:02.389 --> 03:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:11.990 --> 03:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:14.950 --> 03:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon chairman Alexander
 
03:37:17.389 --> 03:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
and um housing committee members my name
 
03:37:19.630 --> 03:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
is Katherine Barby and I'm register of
 
03:37:21.469 --> 03:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
deeds in straford county and I'm
 
03:37:22.790 --> 03:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire registry
 
03:37:23.990 --> 03:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
of deeds
 
03:37:26.269 --> 03:37:26.279 align:start position:0%
Association um on behalf of the New
 
03:37:28.030 --> 03:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire registry Deeds Association
 
03:37:29.830 --> 03:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
I've submitted a letter in opposition to
 
03:37:32.990 --> 03:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 558 outlining several
 
03:37:35.070 --> 03:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
concerns that the registry of deeds
 
03:37:37.670 --> 03:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
Association has with the bill the
 
03:37:39.710 --> 03:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds Association does not
 
03:37:42.110 --> 03:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
agree that the landlord registry that is
 
03:37:45.189 --> 03:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
proposed by House Bill 558 be housed and
 
03:37:47.910 --> 03:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
AD administered by the registry of deeds
 
03:37:51.309 --> 03:37:51.319 align:start position:0%
offices the purpose of House Bill 558 is
 
03:37:53.229 --> 03:37:53.239 align:start position:0%
completely different and is not related
 
03:37:56.710 --> 03:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
to the current duties functions and
 
03:37:58.670 --> 03:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the registers of
 
03:38:01.269 --> 03:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
Deeds as set forth in New Hampshire RSA
 
03:38:04.429 --> 03:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
478 what is proposed by this bill really
 
03:38:06.550 --> 03:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
is data collection and it is
 
03:38:09.189 --> 03:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the grantor grantee
 
03:38:11.670 --> 03:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
indexing and processing used by the New
 
03:38:13.750 --> 03:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire registry of deeds offices
 
03:38:15.950 --> 03:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
which is required by Statute
 
03:38:17.670 --> 03:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
essentially if this bill were passed as
 
03:38:19.150 --> 03:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
written there would be established a
 
03:38:21.349 --> 03:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
completely separate registry for
 
03:38:23.110 --> 03:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
landlords within the registry of deeds
 
03:38:26.110 --> 03:38:26.120 align:start position:0%
offices requiring additional technology
 
03:38:28.830 --> 03:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
and Staffing to effectuate its goals and
 
03:38:30.750 --> 03:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
I think that that was admitted by um
 
03:38:34.189 --> 03:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
representative um Reed our vendor who
 
03:38:36.510 --> 03:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
provides technology and services to over
 
03:38:38.870 --> 03:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
300 registry of deeds offices throughout
 
03:38:41.189 --> 03:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
the country does not know of one
 
03:38:43.630 --> 03:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
registry that also houses a landlord
 
03:38:45.950 --> 03:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
registry after researching landlord
 
03:38:47.389 --> 03:38:47.399 align:start position:0%
Registries myself throughout the country
 
03:38:49.269 --> 03:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
I've not found that I also have not
 
03:38:51.309 --> 03:38:51.319 align:start position:0%
found one that's reg that is housed in
 
03:38:53.830 --> 03:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
the registry of deeds offices further
 
03:38:55.910 --> 03:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
the requirement set forth by House Bill
 
03:38:58.189 --> 03:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
558 which was mentioned by um
 
03:39:00.030 --> 03:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
03:39:02.429 --> 03:39:02.439 align:start position:0%
it there is a concern you know for that
 
03:39:03.910 --> 03:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
to be up and running even if it is six
 
03:39:06.590 --> 03:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
months you know after there is a concern
 
03:39:08.590 --> 03:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
of the registers regarding getting that
 
03:39:11.349 --> 03:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
implemented I mean straford County alone
 
03:39:14.590 --> 03:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
we have approximately 138,000 residents
 
03:39:17.429 --> 03:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
about 38% % of them rent so those
 
03:39:19.070 --> 03:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
numbers show that it's not an
 
03:39:21.750 --> 03:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
insignificant undertaking to have that
 
03:39:23.790 --> 03:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
set up in our opinion and to have it
 
03:39:26.349 --> 03:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
done correctly um further the bill
 
03:39:29.309 --> 03:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
proposes that landlords annually record
 
03:39:30.950 --> 03:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
with the county registers thereby
 
03:39:33.429 --> 03:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
requiring thousands of additional
 
03:39:37.389 --> 03:39:37.399 align:start position:0%
recordings per year with no mention of
 
03:39:40.030 --> 03:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
fees or if the individual counties
 
03:39:42.229 --> 03:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
should absorb the additional costs
 
03:39:44.790 --> 03:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
related to these recordings I'm actually
 
03:39:46.389 --> 03:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
quite surprised Uris that there would be
 
03:39:48.750 --> 03:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
this type of Bill that would
 
03:39:52.110 --> 03:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
be sponsored without any type of
 
03:39:55.269 --> 03:39:55.279 align:start position:0%
consideration about the costs associated
 
03:39:59.870 --> 03:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
with you know with implementing it um
 
03:40:01.349 --> 03:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
also I would like to mention that New
 
03:40:04.349 --> 03:40:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:07.030 --> 03:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
541b currently requires landlords to
 
03:40:09.910 --> 03:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
file a statement with regard um a
 
03:40:13.550 --> 03:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
statement of agent for each property
 
03:40:15.990 --> 03:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
that a landlord owns within the city of
 
03:40:20.670 --> 03:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
or town where the um property is located
 
03:40:23.550 --> 03:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
um the Deeds Association believes that
 
03:40:25.750 --> 03:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
if the landlord registry were to go into
 
03:40:27.429 --> 03:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
effect that it should follow New
 
03:40:30.830 --> 03:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire RSA 540 and be administered by
 
03:40:33.030 --> 03:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
the individual towns or offices that
 
03:40:34.670 --> 03:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
that would be the more appropriate place
 
03:40:36.510 --> 03:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
and um you know and looking at these
 
03:40:37.950 --> 03:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
across the country it seems like that
 
03:40:39.590 --> 03:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
that is where the majority of landlord
 
03:40:41.349 --> 03:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
Registries where they're in effect where
 
03:40:45.830 --> 03:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
they are um held or or kept and um
 
03:40:47.389 --> 03:40:47.399 align:start position:0%
I think even I think Rhode Island
 
03:40:48.990 --> 03:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
actually has it in their Department of
 
03:40:52.790 --> 03:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
Health so um thank you for your
 
03:40:55.189 --> 03:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
consideration um it's if anyone has any
 
03:40:56.950 --> 03:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
questions I'm happy to try to answer
 
03:41:00.309 --> 03:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
them for you does anybody have any
 
03:41:04.670 --> 03:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:11.469 --> 03:41:11.479 align:start position:0%

you Matt Beacon
 
03:42:21.269 --> 03:42:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:23.269 --> 03:42:23.279 align:start position:0%
Realtors good afternoon everyone I'm
 
03:42:25.910 --> 03:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
Matt bacon I'm a realtor member here in
 
03:42:27.550 --> 03:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire for the New
 
03:42:28.950 --> 03:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of Realtors as
 
03:42:30.990 --> 03:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
well as a member of the public policy
 
03:42:32.510 --> 03:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
committee and the commercial investment
 
03:42:34.590 --> 03:42:34.600 align:start position:0%
board of realtors public policy
 
03:42:37.070 --> 03:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
committees uh NH is opposed to House
 
03:42:40.229 --> 03:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
Bill 558 lease terms are a private
 
03:42:41.830 --> 03:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
contract between a landlord and tenant
 
03:42:44.229 --> 03:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
intended as short-term agreements unlike
 
03:42:46.670 --> 03:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
home sales which are long-term uh
 
03:42:48.469 --> 03:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
contract this bill would likely hurt
 
03:42:50.510 --> 03:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
quite a number of tenants uh the reason
 
03:42:51.910 --> 03:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
we believe this is that publicizing
 
03:42:53.510 --> 03:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
rents will allow an artificially
 
03:42:56.670 --> 03:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
standardized pricing in to develop in an
 
03:42:59.189 --> 03:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
area um for example landlords might come
 
03:43:00.630 --> 03:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
to recognize that they're offering units
 
03:43:02.389 --> 03:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
below the area rents which could drive
 
03:43:04.990 --> 03:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
prices up um and this illustrates the
 
03:43:06.790 --> 03:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
inaccuracy of the sponsor statement that
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
landlords are price fixing without this
 
03:43:10.870 --> 03:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
since landlords can currently look up a
 
03:43:12.910 --> 03:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
list of recently offered and rented
 
03:43:15.229 --> 03:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
units uh and see what comparables exist
 
03:43:18.710 --> 03:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
in the market today um the real driver
 
03:43:21.349 --> 03:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
of Rental rent changes in this market
 
03:43:23.349 --> 03:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
are construction costs and lack of
 
03:43:25.590 --> 03:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
Supply the lack of supply has been in
 
03:43:27.710 --> 03:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
existence since before the pandemic and
 
03:43:30.110 --> 03:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
inflationary spikes and costs that we're
 
03:43:32.309 --> 03:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
experiencing today so this is well
 
03:43:33.710 --> 03:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
documented also by the New Hampshire
 
03:43:35.189 --> 03:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
Housing Finance Authority in their
 
03:43:36.309 --> 03:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
official studies that have been
 
03:43:38.950 --> 03:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
published for years a public registry
 
03:43:41.149 --> 03:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
will oversimplify rents by excluding
 
03:43:42.910 --> 03:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
information that is important about
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
condition motivation and more that is
 
03:43:46.590 --> 03:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
needed when landlords consider sending
 
03:43:49.189 --> 03:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
rents as well this could also mislead
 
03:43:51.710 --> 03:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
potential renters and landlords there
 
03:43:54.070 --> 03:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
were about 177,000 residential sales in
 
03:43:55.750 --> 03:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire last year it's a
 
03:43:57.830 --> 03:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
manageable number of transactions to
 
03:44:00.149 --> 03:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
register there are hundreds of thousands
 
03:44:01.830 --> 03:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
of residential leases in New Hampshire
 
03:44:03.950 --> 03:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
which change not just annually but often
 
03:44:06.389 --> 03:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
monthly the cost to administer and
 
03:44:07.670 --> 03:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
maintain such a list would be
 
03:44:09.110 --> 03:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
significant as evidenced by the
 
03:44:11.910 --> 03:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
testimony of the county regist herself
 
03:44:13.349 --> 03:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
eventually Property Owners would be
 
03:44:14.830 --> 03:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
asked to pick up the tab which would
 
03:44:16.990 --> 03:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
only exacerbate our housing crisis and
 
03:44:18.630 --> 03:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
be a disincentive to landlords to add
 
03:44:21.710 --> 03:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
more units or to keep rents low the path
 
03:44:23.269 --> 03:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
to lower rents is for the government to
 
03:44:24.950 --> 03:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
allow more units to come online in our
 
03:44:27.030 --> 03:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire towns and cities through
 
03:44:29.229 --> 03:44:29.239 align:start position:0%
reforms in our zoning laws House Bill
 
03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
558 is offered under the guise of
 
03:44:33.149 --> 03:44:33.159 align:start position:0%
helping atrisk tenants but it will make
 
03:44:36.189 --> 03:44:36.199 align:start position:0%
our affordability crisis worse thank you
 
03:44:37.469 --> 03:44:37.479 align:start position:0%
thank you happy to answer any questions
 
03:44:39.429 --> 03:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
03:44:42.590 --> 03:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
hegner thank you so much chair um thank
 
03:44:44.309 --> 03:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
you so much for coming to speak to us
 
03:44:46.389 --> 03:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm just um trying to figure out I
 
03:44:49.389 --> 03:44:49.399 align:start position:0%
know places like Conway um the municipal
 
03:44:51.950 --> 03:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
level is already trying to do a landlord
 
03:44:53.670 --> 03:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
um registry to track these type of
 
03:44:55.950 --> 03:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
things to educate us more so we can get
 
03:44:57.950 --> 03:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of this just any thoughts
 
03:45:01.630 --> 03:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
on that uh I don't see a lot of need for
 
03:45:03.710 --> 03:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
the town to do that to educate it um
 
03:45:05.510 --> 03:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
some of the best quality research I've
 
03:45:08.349 --> 03:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
seen on housing rental rates home sales
 
03:45:10.590 --> 03:45:10.600 align:start position:0%
occupancy rates comes from the New
 
03:45:12.349 --> 03:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority
 
03:45:14.269 --> 03:45:14.279 align:start position:0%
which accesses direct landlord data they
 
03:45:15.630 --> 03:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
pull people
 
03:45:17.790 --> 03:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
um they use HUD data as well as
 
03:45:19.590 --> 03:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
administering the subsidies that are
 
03:45:23.070 --> 03:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
used in these communities so um I think
 
03:45:25.510 --> 03:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
that that's something that is a very
 
03:45:27.990 --> 03:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
limited pool of people trying to do some
 
03:45:29.950 --> 03:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
research that is already being done by
 
03:45:31.189 --> 03:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
someone with a lot more research
 
03:45:32.670 --> 03:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
capability and I think we should if
 
03:45:34.830 --> 03:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
anything focus on expanding what New
 
03:45:37.309 --> 03:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing is doing to understand
 
03:45:39.590 --> 03:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
not just the the current market and
 
03:45:41.389 --> 03:45:41.399 align:start position:0%
where it is but also to continue to try
 
03:45:43.469 --> 03:45:43.479 align:start position:0%
to solve the
 
03:45:47.389 --> 03:45:47.399 align:start position:0%
problem follow up yeah just a followup
 
03:45:50.830 --> 03:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh sorry um so if landlords have this
 
03:45:53.550 --> 03:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
like um registry where they can look at
 
03:45:55.750 --> 03:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
comps shouldn't it be fair that renters
 
03:45:58.429 --> 03:45:58.439 align:start position:0%
could probably do the same thing on what
 
03:46:02.309 --> 03:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
landlords are doing so um I'm not aware
 
03:46:04.870 --> 03:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
of anything that uh landlords can use to
 
03:46:07.910 --> 03:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
look up rents that um most tenants can't
 
03:46:11.910 --> 03:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
use as well um most commonly when I'm
 
03:46:13.630 --> 03:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
looking up something to lease a unit
 
03:46:17.070 --> 03:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
that I own I look look at what Zillow uh
 
03:46:19.309 --> 03:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
Craigslist Facebook Marketplace have had
 
03:46:22.070 --> 03:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
for recently advertised units I compare
 
03:46:23.830 --> 03:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
where my unit looks like those recently
 
03:46:25.510 --> 03:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
advertised units and that's how I set my
 
03:46:27.550 --> 03:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
pricing to make sure that I can lease
 
03:46:31.309 --> 03:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
out the unit um there's not any
 
03:46:33.550 --> 03:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
advantage uh of looking way back in
 
03:46:34.990 --> 03:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
history or of having something that
 
03:46:37.149 --> 03:46:37.159 align:start position:0%
includes rents that were uh from people
 
03:46:39.149 --> 03:46:39.159 align:start position:0%
that moved in 10 years ago which this
 
03:46:41.229 --> 03:46:41.239 align:start position:0%
would then publicize and more than
 
03:46:43.349 --> 03:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
likely have those landlords that have
 
03:46:45.670 --> 03:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
those uh lower lease to raise them in
 
03:46:45.680 --> 03:46:48.590 align:start position:0%
those uh lower lease to raise them in
the

03:46:48.590 --> 03:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:51.750 --> 03:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
future any other questions seean thank
 
03:46:59.110 --> 03:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:01.750 --> 03:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
Freeman all right uh good afternoon uh
 
03:47:04.229 --> 03:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
Chris Freeman um I am the executive
 
03:47:06.590 --> 03:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
manager of beltower property management
 
03:47:08.550 --> 03:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
and I also sit with the madok resource
 
03:47:10.389 --> 03:47:10.399 align:start position:0%
Alliance um today I am representing
 
03:47:12.469 --> 03:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
myself and not the views of the manano
 
03:47:15.269 --> 03:47:15.279 align:start position:0%
resource Alliance um I'm speaking here
 
03:47:17.149 --> 03:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
today to urge uh the committee to vote
 
03:47:19.469 --> 03:47:19.479 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate uh on the
 
03:47:21.349 --> 03:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
basis that the proposal substantially
 
03:47:23.149 --> 03:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
conflicts with the landlords uh
 
03:47:25.149 --> 03:47:25.159 align:start position:0%
pre-existing compliance obligations
 
03:47:26.910 --> 03:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
which would preempt the landlord from
 
03:47:30.429 --> 03:47:30.439 align:start position:0%
complying with the proposal um uh in
 
03:47:32.750 --> 03:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
ways that violate the consumer privacy
 
03:47:34.910 --> 03:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
rights of tenants and which also Place
 
03:47:38.309 --> 03:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh strong upwards pressures on rents uh
 
03:47:40.070 --> 03:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the landlord's fair
 
03:47:42.910 --> 03:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
housing compliance practices um if I
 
03:47:44.990 --> 03:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
have time I'll also get to the first fth
 
03:47:46.349 --> 03:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
and potentially 14th Amendment
 
03:47:48.670 --> 03:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
violations that are implied by the
 
03:47:50.710 --> 03:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
language of the bill um but just to
 
03:47:53.590 --> 03:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
start off um with the uh landlord's
 
03:47:54.990 --> 03:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
obligation to comply with The Fair
 
03:47:57.229 --> 03:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
Credit Reporting Act under federal law
 
03:47:58.870 --> 03:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
under current law landlords fall under
 
03:48:01.590 --> 03:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
the purview of ficra um at certain
 
03:48:03.710 --> 03:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
points including during screenings uh
 
03:48:05.710 --> 03:48:05.720 align:start position:0%
and also if they extend structured
 
03:48:08.229 --> 03:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
credit to a tenant they potentially uh
 
03:48:10.189 --> 03:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
qualify as a creditor so that would be
 
03:48:12.830 --> 03:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
an example where a landlord has um
 
03:48:14.910 --> 03:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
accepted a payment plan as an
 
03:48:17.229 --> 03:48:17.239 align:start position:0%
alternative to a non-payment eviction
 
03:48:18.990 --> 03:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
for somebody who is in a rears on their
 
03:48:22.110 --> 03:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
rent um under the proposed law landlords
 
03:48:24.830 --> 03:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
would become furnishers of financial
 
03:48:27.189 --> 03:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
information um and that's on the basis
 
03:48:28.510 --> 03:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
that the information that they would be
 
03:48:30.550 --> 03:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
providing to a public reg registry is
 
03:48:32.269 --> 03:48:32.279 align:start position:0%
highly likely to be used for
 
03:48:35.149 --> 03:48:35.159 align:start position:0%
determinations of creditworthiness um we
 
03:48:36.750 --> 03:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
would use that information that's
 
03:48:39.710 --> 03:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
publicly available to uh provide a fraud
 
03:48:42.070 --> 03:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
control check in rental applications so
 
03:48:44.750 --> 03:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
we request uh information on rental ad
 
03:48:46.149 --> 03:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
address history including the rate that
 
03:48:48.030 --> 03:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
they have paid historically and if this
 
03:48:49.510 --> 03:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
information were available we would be
 
03:48:51.349 --> 03:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
cross-checking it to see if we relied to
 
03:48:53.189 --> 03:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
on the application which means that it
 
03:48:56.149 --> 03:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
is a um document and information source
 
03:48:58.309 --> 03:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
that is used for establishing
 
03:49:01.070 --> 03:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
creditworthiness um by being compelled
 
03:49:03.389 --> 03:49:03.399 align:start position:0%
to submit data into this we become reg
 
03:49:05.269 --> 03:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh regulated furnishers of financial
 
03:49:06.950 --> 03:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
information which means that we would be
 
03:49:09.110 --> 03:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
obligated to tightly control the
 
03:49:10.590 --> 03:49:10.600 align:start position:0%
dissemination of any personally
 
03:49:13.149 --> 03:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
identifying information and because this
 
03:49:14.790 --> 03:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
information is being provided at the
 
03:49:16.750 --> 03:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
unit level and it's very easy to find
 
03:49:18.790 --> 03:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
out information about residential
 
03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
addresses using public records including
 
03:49:23.790 --> 03:49:23.800 align:start position:0%
websites like fast people search.com it
 
03:49:25.910 --> 03:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
would be very easy for members of the
 
03:49:27.870 --> 03:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
general public to identify with
 
03:49:30.309 --> 03:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
specificity uh how much individuals were
 
03:49:32.750 --> 03:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
paying in rent and that could lead uh
 
03:49:34.389 --> 03:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's clearly a violation of the
 
03:49:35.870 --> 03:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
tenants consumer privacy rights under
 
03:49:37.990 --> 03:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
ficra but it could also lead to um
 
03:49:40.510 --> 03:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
issues with stocking harassment targeted
 
03:49:45.469 --> 03:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
uh uh targeted Financial scams uh ET
 
03:49:45.479 --> 03:49:47.990 align:start position:0%
uh uh targeted Financial scams uh ET
ET

03:49:47.990 --> 03:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
ET
 
03:49:51.149 --> 03:49:51.159 align:start position:0%
um uh so that's it for ficra um under
 
03:49:53.630 --> 03:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
the Fair Housing Act uh sophisticated
 
03:49:55.030 --> 03:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
and professional landlords will
 
03:49:56.429 --> 03:49:56.439 align:start position:0%
typically maintain a compliance
 
03:49:58.750 --> 03:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
framework uh that is intended to not
 
03:50:01.149 --> 03:50:01.159 align:start position:0%
only ensure that they do not actually
 
03:50:03.269 --> 03:50:03.279 align:start position:0%
discriminate against prospective or
 
03:50:06.110 --> 03:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
actual tenants but also to proactively
 
03:50:08.710 --> 03:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
defend against the appearance that they
 
03:50:11.429 --> 03:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
have discriminated against tenants and
 
03:50:14.110 --> 03:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
the problems with having a public record
 
03:50:16.710 --> 03:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
of all those rents is that it reveals
 
03:50:18.550 --> 03:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
only the negotiated outcomes of the
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
leasing transaction and not the actual
 
03:50:23.950 --> 03:50:23.960 align:start position:0%
details of that transaction and so there
 
03:50:25.870 --> 03:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
are plenty of legitimate business
 
03:50:27.389 --> 03:50:27.399 align:start position:0%
reasons why there could be natural
 
03:50:29.349 --> 03:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
variations in rent you might have
 
03:50:31.429 --> 03:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
somebody who is an inplace tenant who
 
03:50:33.349 --> 03:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
has been there for years and you may as
 
03:50:35.990 --> 03:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
a measure of loyalty have kept them
 
03:50:38.030 --> 03:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
below inflationary adjustments we do
 
03:50:41.309 --> 03:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
this fairly routinely um we might have a
 
03:50:43.269 --> 03:50:43.279 align:start position:0%
longer term lease that we offer
 
03:50:45.070 --> 03:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
favorable pricing we might have a
 
03:50:46.950 --> 03:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
shorter term lease that we offer higher
 
03:50:48.790 --> 03:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
pricing in order to offset our increased
 
03:50:50.790 --> 03:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
administrative burdens and the problem
 
03:50:52.389 --> 03:50:52.399 align:start position:0%
with a public rent registry is that none
 
03:50:54.750 --> 03:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
of that is apparent to third parties who
 
03:50:57.870 --> 03:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
might be reviewing it and um due to
 
03:50:59.389 --> 03:50:59.399 align:start position:0%
sampling issues you could potentially
 
03:51:00.990 --> 03:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
end up with a situation where somebody
 
03:51:03.670 --> 03:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
who's receiving a favorable rental rate
 
03:51:06.389 --> 03:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
belongs to one me one protected class
 
03:51:07.510 --> 03:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
and somebody who's receiving an
 
03:51:10.030 --> 03:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
unfavorable rate belongs to another one
 
03:51:11.510 --> 03:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
and a great example of that would be
 
03:51:13.950 --> 03:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
travel nurses which due to uh recent
 
03:51:16.229 --> 03:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
Visa regul ations uh and initiatives by
 
03:51:17.510 --> 03:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
the hospitals have been
 
03:51:20.149 --> 03:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
disproportionately people of color those
 
03:51:22.790 --> 03:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
rates appear higher in our rent data not
 
03:51:24.349 --> 03:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
because of the membership in the
 
03:51:26.070 --> 03:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
protected class but because they are
 
03:51:27.630 --> 03:51:27.640 align:start position:0%
only signing a three-month lease
 
03:51:29.510 --> 03:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
commitment and in order for us to
 
03:51:32.229 --> 03:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
justify turning that unit over every
 
03:51:34.269 --> 03:51:34.279 align:start position:0%
three months we need to charge a higher
 
03:51:35.630 --> 03:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
rate to cover our
 
03:51:37.990 --> 03:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
costs um and so I I think what would
 
03:51:40.550 --> 03:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
happen if this law were passed is that
 
03:51:42.070 --> 03:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh landlords defending against the
 
03:51:44.149 --> 03:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
appearance of unequal treatment would
 
03:51:46.469 --> 03:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
have a very strong incentive to raise
 
03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
all rents to the highest defensible
 
03:51:52.389 --> 03:51:52.399 align:start position:0%
market rate that's what I would be doing
 
03:51:55.030 --> 03:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
um and and yeah I'll I'll stop there on
 
03:51:57.349 --> 03:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
that one um in addition uh the language
 
03:51:59.429 --> 03:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
about algorithms is unconstitutionally
 
03:52:02.189 --> 03:52:02.199 align:start position:0%
vague and fails to provide landlords
 
03:52:05.030 --> 03:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
with uh proper notice of their
 
03:52:06.990 --> 03:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
obligations so it doesn't Define what an
 
03:52:09.710 --> 03:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
algorithm is but according to Google uh
 
03:52:11.510 --> 03:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
an algorithm is a process or set of
 
03:52:14.149 --> 03:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
rules to be followed in calculations or
 
03:52:17.590 --> 03:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
other problem solving operations um so
 
03:52:18.910 --> 03:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
that could be something as simple as a
 
03:52:20.990 --> 03:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
mathematical operation that could be as
 
03:52:23.110 --> 03:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
simple as saying last month I rented a
 
03:52:26.590 --> 03:52:26.600 align:start position:0%
1,000 foot apartment for $1,000 this
 
03:52:28.990 --> 03:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
900t apartment should be
 
03:52:31.269 --> 03:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
$900 uh it could also potentially
 
03:52:32.950 --> 03:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
Encompass the calculation of voucher
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
payment standards set forth by housing
 
03:52:36.790 --> 03:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
authorities which are determined on an
 
03:52:39.269 --> 03:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
algorithmic basis that includes the
 
03:52:42.429 --> 03:52:42.439 align:start position:0%
statistical analysis of rents in a given
 
03:52:45.149 --> 03:52:45.159 align:start position:0%
market area uh with adjust ments made
 
03:52:48.030 --> 03:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
for recent mover status so um the need
 
03:52:49.630 --> 03:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
to adjust for that speaks to the fact
 
03:52:51.950 --> 03:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
that many landlords do keep their rents
 
03:52:54.110 --> 03:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
lower for established Tendencies so much
 
03:52:56.070 --> 03:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
so that HUD when determining what a true
 
03:52:59.790 --> 03:52:59.800 align:start position:0%
market rent is has to adjust for it um
 
03:53:01.630 --> 03:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
you know barring this I'm not sure how I
 
03:53:03.910 --> 03:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
would go about setting my rents I don't
 
03:53:05.870 --> 03:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
know if I should consult tea leaves or
 
03:53:07.750 --> 03:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
sacrifice a goat and look at the end
 
03:53:10.870 --> 03:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
Trails um I'm reminded of a recent
 
03:53:13.229 --> 03:53:13.239 align:start position:0%
headline in uh the satirical newspaper
 
03:53:14.990 --> 03:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
the onion which read
 
03:53:17.149 --> 03:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
landlord forced to raise rents due to
 
03:53:18.550 --> 03:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
thinking of a bigger
 
03:53:21.030 --> 03:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
number and I'm wondering if that is all
 
03:53:22.349 --> 03:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
I would have available to me when it
 
03:53:26.149 --> 03:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:28.870 --> 03:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
rentals and that is all I have to say
 
03:53:30.309 --> 03:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
thank you I was I thought that was a
 
03:53:32.590 --> 03:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
great way to end okay any questions for
 
03:53:32.600 --> 03:53:34.070 align:start position:0%
great way to end okay any questions for
Mr

03:53:34.070 --> 03:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
03:53:37.149 --> 03:53:37.159 align:start position:0%
Freeman seeing none thank you for your
 
03:53:48.030 --> 03:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:49.750 --> 03:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
my name is David Klein I'm a small
 
03:53:51.469 --> 03:53:51.479 align:start position:0%
landlord with properties on the Sea
 
03:53:51.479 --> 03:53:53.550 align:start position:0%
landlord with properties on the Sea
Coast

03:53:53.550 --> 03:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
Coast
 
03:53:56.950 --> 03:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
um start off with rent prices are high
 
03:53:58.910 --> 03:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
because of supply and demand it's basic
 
03:54:00.990 --> 03:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
economics we do not have sufficient
 
03:54:04.229 --> 03:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
Supply this bill will not add one unit
 
03:54:07.110 --> 03:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
of Supply to help reduce costs not even
 
03:54:09.870 --> 03:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
one unit and in fact it's going to raise
 
03:54:12.710 --> 03:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
taxes on the county level to support
 
03:54:14.510 --> 03:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
putting together the registry and if you
 
03:54:16.149 --> 03:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
notice it's also asking for layouts of
 
03:54:18.189 --> 03:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
the apartments size and so forth all
 
03:54:20.110 --> 03:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
that information is already collected
 
03:54:22.670 --> 03:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
Now by local tax assessor office so
 
03:54:23.830 --> 03:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to have two government
 
03:54:27.590 --> 03:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
entities collecting the same data total
 
03:54:29.469 --> 03:54:29.479 align:start position:0%
waste of taxpayer
 
03:54:32.630 --> 03:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
money um and I'm going to cut some of my
 
03:54:33.830 --> 03:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
comments because they were covered by
 
03:54:36.590 --> 03:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
other one other people um one of the
 
03:54:38.830 --> 03:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
things that I heard from the
 
03:54:40.750 --> 03:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
representative the sponsor is about
 
03:54:43.990 --> 03:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
price fixing there was no empirical data
 
03:54:47.149 --> 03:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
presented Ed at all to you nothing other
 
03:54:49.030 --> 03:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
than the program exists and I'll will
 
03:54:50.950 --> 03:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
tell you it's a small landlord I didn't
 
03:54:53.590 --> 03:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
even hear of it or know of it my method
 
03:54:55.349 --> 03:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
of looking for what I'm going to rent my
 
03:54:57.309 --> 03:54:57.319 align:start position:0%
apartments for is the same as the person
 
03:54:59.870 --> 03:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
from the broker who's in before I look
 
03:55:02.269 --> 03:55:02.279 align:start position:0%
up Zillow which is exactly available to
 
03:55:05.349 --> 03:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
everybody we look up crawick again on
 
03:55:08.389 --> 03:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
the internet and that's what we use and
 
03:55:09.830 --> 03:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
part of my problem with the bill is that
 
03:55:12.110 --> 03:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
last section 10 we shall not use any
 
03:55:15.590 --> 03:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
algorithm or any software it's very
 
03:55:17.670 --> 03:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionally vague it doesn't tell
 
03:55:20.070 --> 03:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
us what the prohibited practice is a
 
03:55:21.790 --> 03:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
very simple example is if I use
 
03:55:25.910 --> 03:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
QuickBooks software look up how much my
 
03:55:28.309 --> 03:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
taxes insurance and heat bills have gone
 
03:55:30.429 --> 03:55:30.439 align:start position:0%
up in the last 12 months to make sure I
 
03:55:32.750 --> 03:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
build them into any rent increases that
 
03:55:35.110 --> 03:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
would be violating the statute and
 
03:55:36.990 --> 03:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
that's a very standard common practice
 
03:55:38.790 --> 03:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
how much of your costs gone up before
 
03:55:41.349 --> 03:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
you make a rent increase so that this
 
03:55:43.309 --> 03:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
bill is ridiculous in the way it's set
 
03:55:46.070 --> 03:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
up it's uncon constitutional and I would
 
03:55:48.870 --> 03:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
ask you to vote against it I thank you
 
03:55:52.070 --> 03:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you questions seeing none thank
 
03:55:56.590 --> 03:55:56.600 align:start position:0%
you um representative cybert cert my
 
03:55:59.670 --> 03:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
apologies that's okay actually you had
 
03:56:01.750 --> 03:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
it right it's actually cyber I just I
 
03:56:04.790 --> 03:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
quit correcting people on it it was a
 
03:56:07.469 --> 03:56:07.479 align:start position:0%
lot easier um yeah I'm just coming
 
03:56:09.910 --> 03:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
before you today in support of this
 
03:56:12.790 --> 03:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
legislation it's very obvious that um
 
03:56:15.349 --> 03:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
just beneath all of of it we need
 
03:56:18.469 --> 03:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
numbers we need more data um and we need
 
03:56:20.550 --> 03:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
some sort of data collection that's only
 
03:56:23.030 --> 03:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
fair and we do owe it to the citizens of
 
03:56:26.030 --> 03:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who are consumers you know
 
03:56:27.590 --> 03:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
and we tend to not have a lot of
 
03:56:30.429 --> 03:56:30.439 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protections and that's truly
 
03:56:33.630 --> 03:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
what this is um I just believe we really
 
03:56:35.950 --> 03:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
need to just make sure nobody is going
 
03:56:37.429 --> 03:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
out of the bounds and then there's not
 
03:56:40.590 --> 03:56:40.600 align:start position:0%
like this domino effect um you know if
 
03:56:43.389 --> 03:56:43.399 align:start position:0%
one person you know decides to go crazy
 
03:56:45.070 --> 03:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
with their pricing or something like
 
03:56:47.990 --> 03:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
that um we need to be able to keep um
 
03:56:50.510 --> 03:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
our Workforce here in New Hampshire um
 
03:56:52.389 --> 03:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
the big or small Workforce no matter how
 
03:56:55.590 --> 03:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
much you make um and that's what I have
 
03:56:57.550 --> 03:56:57.560 align:start position:0%
to say about that any questions thank
 
03:56:59.510 --> 03:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
you questions for representative
 
03:57:01.630 --> 03:57:01.640 align:start position:0%
Sebert um representative
 
03:57:04.429 --> 03:57:04.439 align:start position:0%
Faxton one brief question you said we
 
03:57:06.469 --> 03:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
don't have numbers are you familiar with
 
03:57:07.750 --> 03:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Housing Finance
 
03:57:09.830 --> 03:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
Authority yeah and are you familiar with
 
03:57:11.750 --> 03:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
their annual rental analysis that they
 
03:57:14.830 --> 03:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
do yeah so you know that every year the
 
03:57:16.429 --> 03:57:16.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority
 
03:57:19.070 --> 03:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
generates a detailed report on the cost
 
03:57:23.870 --> 03:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
of housing by County by unit number and
 
03:57:25.630 --> 03:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
every other possible metric you could
 
03:57:29.750 --> 03:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
have so isn't that good enough well I I
 
03:57:32.590 --> 03:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
it'd be good to have more of a state
 
03:57:35.510 --> 03:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
level um initiative of that and just
 
03:57:37.269 --> 03:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
account by count not always just like a
 
03:57:39.750 --> 03:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
yearly thing because within a year
 
03:57:42.269 --> 03:57:42.279 align:start position:0%
prices can just jump and it's good to
 
03:57:43.870 --> 03:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
actually look at it and be able to see
 
03:57:43.880 --> 03:57:45.030 align:start position:0%
actually look at it and be able to see
why

03:57:45.030 --> 03:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
why
 
03:57:45.040 --> 03:57:46.070 align:start position:0%
why
and

03:57:46.070 --> 03:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:57:49.510 --> 03:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
where more specifically go ahead well in
 
03:57:51.910 --> 03:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
new so you want like a daily you want
 
03:57:54.469 --> 03:57:54.479 align:start position:0%
like the Stock Market ticker on this I
 
03:57:57.229 --> 03:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
would say every time an apartment gets
 
03:57:59.790 --> 03:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
rented out to a new person yeah so you
 
03:58:01.189 --> 03:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
would be able to follow that on
 
03:58:03.349 --> 03:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
realtor.com or Zillow or any of those
 
03:58:05.149 --> 03:58:05.159 align:start position:0%
places if you want to follow the market
 
03:58:07.990 --> 03:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
but you you have a much you have you
 
03:58:09.670 --> 03:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
ever looked at the nham Housing Finance
 
03:58:11.630 --> 03:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
Authority report I should probably look
 
03:58:14.389 --> 03:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
at it a little closer but um very
 
03:58:15.870 --> 03:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
detailed and everything you've said
 
03:58:18.349 --> 03:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
isn't available is there in detail well
 
03:58:20.990 --> 03:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
I can't answer to your question so okay
 
03:58:22.389 --> 03:58:22.399 align:start position:0%
you haven't seen it it seems like that's
 
03:58:25.349 --> 03:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
not helping the situation okay any other
 
03:58:27.070 --> 03:58:27.080 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
03:58:29.030 --> 03:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you for
 
03:58:37.149 --> 03:58:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:40.229 --> 03:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you honorable Mr chair and
 
03:58:41.550 --> 03:58:41.560 align:start position:0%
uh committee members thank you for
 
03:58:42.469 --> 03:58:42.479 align:start position:0%
having me today my name is
 
03:58:43.790 --> 03:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative Heath Howard I represent
 
03:58:45.710 --> 03:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
the of straford and barington in
 
03:58:48.510 --> 03:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
straford District 4 uh I'm in support of
 
03:58:51.389 --> 03:58:51.399 align:start position:0%
this legislation because I think that
 
03:58:53.389 --> 03:58:53.399 align:start position:0%
this is a good way that we can actually
 
03:58:56.110 --> 03:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
track uh what types of uh rents are
 
03:58:58.149 --> 03:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
being charged because this is landlord
 
03:59:00.550 --> 03:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
specific the the representative faxon's
 
03:59:02.429 --> 03:59:02.439 align:start position:0%
Point uh with the New Hampshire housing
 
03:59:04.790 --> 03:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
Alliance it's not landlord specific
 
03:59:07.349 --> 03:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
secondly I mean my family we we then the
 
03:59:08.990 --> 03:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
real reason why I'm here today is
 
03:59:11.870 --> 03:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
because uh we we're uh landlords we ran
 
03:59:15.990 --> 03:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
out an Adu uh for about 11 $100 a month
 
03:59:18.790 --> 03:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh and it's uh something where we would
 
03:59:20.910 --> 03:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
be more than willing to submit this type
 
03:59:24.309 --> 03:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
of data to a a a a program that would
 
03:59:27.630 --> 03:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
track this I have no hesitation in that
 
03:59:30.149 --> 03:59:30.159 align:start position:0%
it is about trying to create an
 
03:59:31.830 --> 03:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people to understand
 
03:59:34.469 --> 03:59:34.479 align:start position:0%
what the market is like here uh as well
 
03:59:36.910 --> 03:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
as trying to create an ease in
 
03:59:40.710 --> 03:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
Opportunity so that we not necessarily
 
03:59:43.830 --> 03:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh we're not necessarily forcing people
 
03:59:45.429 --> 03:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
out out of our market and forcing people
 
03:59:46.510 --> 03:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
out of our state because they can't
 
03:59:48.349 --> 03:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
afford it uh with that being said I'm
 
03:59:50.670 --> 03:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
open to any questions thank you
 
03:59:51.870 --> 03:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
03:59:54.630 --> 03:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you thank
 
04:00:02.469 --> 04:00:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:04.469 --> 04:00:04.479 align:start position:0%
Norman thank you once again for the
 
04:00:06.750 --> 04:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak there's so much to
 
04:00:09.550 --> 04:00:09.560 align:start position:0%
say on this one um I I would probably
 
04:00:11.429 --> 04:00:11.439 align:start position:0%
only say a few things a lot of good
 
04:00:13.070 --> 04:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
points have already been made by
 
04:00:15.389 --> 04:00:15.399 align:start position:0%
speakers for me that are opposing the
 
04:00:17.830 --> 04:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
bill I do have written testimony that
 
04:00:20.830 --> 04:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
was emailed to this committee last night
 
04:00:24.590 --> 04:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I've got an extra paper copy that I
 
04:00:25.750 --> 04:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
could turn
 
04:00:29.750 --> 04:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
in as well so there's just so many
 
04:00:34.070 --> 04:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
points to cover um I don't see any
 
04:00:36.910 --> 04:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
perceivable benefit by having this large
 
04:00:41.070 --> 04:00:41.080 align:start position:0%
complex um data of rents because rents
 
04:00:46.269 --> 04:00:46.279 align:start position:0%
are so individual and they portray is to
 
04:00:49.550 --> 04:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
the the reasons that that rent was Set
 
04:00:52.389 --> 04:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh like Chris Freeman said there's many
 
04:00:55.710 --> 04:00:55.720 align:start position:0%
conditions in in why you set set a rent
 
04:00:58.349 --> 04:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
you can't just arbitrarily look at two
 
04:01:00.510 --> 04:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
bedroom two bedroom two bedroom and say
 
04:01:02.670 --> 04:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
that it's comparable it's it's not
 
04:01:04.990 --> 04:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
really quite comparing Apples to
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
Apples the New Hampshire Housing Finance
 
04:01:09.269 --> 04:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
survey does give us a tremendous amount
 
04:01:11.670 --> 04:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
of data this would just be a large
 
04:01:14.550 --> 04:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
duplication the tax assessors do have
 
04:01:16.830 --> 04:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
already on their records the information
 
04:01:16.840 --> 04:01:18.469 align:start position:0%
already on their records the information
on

04:01:18.469 --> 04:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:01:21.990 --> 04:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
um the amenities and the square footage
 
04:01:25.189 --> 04:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
and size and so forth I should think it
 
04:01:28.229 --> 04:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
would be a tremendous problem for
 
04:01:32.149 --> 04:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
releasing tenants Privacy
 
04:01:35.469 --> 04:01:35.479 align:start position:0%
Information um this so easily available
 
04:01:37.710 --> 04:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
to get enough information from one
 
04:01:40.630 --> 04:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
source and another to identify
 
04:01:42.550 --> 04:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
personally identify a person and find
 
04:01:45.149 --> 04:01:45.159 align:start position:0%
out you know where they live and their
 
04:01:47.910 --> 04:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
rent and and the rest of that it would
 
04:01:50.309 --> 04:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
be a big burden on the uh registry of
 
04:01:53.910 --> 04:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
deeds it invokes the th000 a day
 
04:01:57.469 --> 04:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
penalty which I think is ridiculous uh
 
04:01:59.670 --> 04:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
in the email that I sent out by the way
 
04:02:01.710 --> 04:02:01.720 align:start position:0%
there is an explanation of how that
 
04:02:04.229 --> 04:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
works and how we come up to the ,000 a
 
04:02:06.670 --> 04:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
day if you're unfamiliar with it you can
 
04:02:08.550 --> 04:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
click on a link there and it'll explain
 
04:02:12.229 --> 04:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
it definition of a landlord is way too
 
04:02:15.469 --> 04:02:15.479 align:start position:0%
broad you could have a family member
 
04:02:20.790 --> 04:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
renting to their relative their niece or
 
04:02:25.229 --> 04:02:25.239 align:start position:0%
um close relative um let's say a a room
 
04:02:27.429 --> 04:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
for two months and so now they have to
 
04:02:31.229 --> 04:02:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:34.550 --> 04:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
registry uh the whole thing about U
 
04:02:37.349 --> 04:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
algorithm is is fairly
 
04:02:41.229 --> 04:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
absurd so there is I understand there's
 
04:02:43.429 --> 04:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
a push back against companies that do
 
04:02:43.439 --> 04:02:44.510 align:start position:0%
a push back against companies that do
renov

04:02:44.510 --> 04:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
renov
 
04:02:48.269 --> 04:02:48.279 align:start position:0%
Ren Revenue management uh real page is
 
04:02:50.309 --> 04:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
one of them but not the only
 
04:02:54.469 --> 04:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
one um the portrayal of that software is
 
04:03:00.110 --> 04:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
is is not what it is those softwares
 
04:03:05.189 --> 04:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
actually will look to minimize vacancy
 
04:03:07.910 --> 04:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
so that it increases the profitability
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the apartment um
 
04:03:14.349 --> 04:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
management and many times
 
04:03:17.630 --> 04:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
that leads to suggestions of lowered
 
04:03:20.550 --> 04:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
rent it's there's nothing in it that's
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
price fixing if you want to understand
 
04:03:26.229 --> 04:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
about Revenue management I'm in contact
 
04:03:28.710 --> 04:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
with one of the attorneys for a very
 
04:03:31.590 --> 04:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
large for actually real page um but the
 
04:03:34.469 --> 04:03:34.479 align:start position:0%
entire industry and we could arrange a a
 
04:03:36.309 --> 04:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
zoom conference
 
04:03:39.149 --> 04:03:39.159 align:start position:0%
or some meeting where they could explain
 
04:03:41.870 --> 04:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
exactly what this this software
 
04:03:44.910 --> 04:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
does most landlords don't use it most
 
04:03:47.229 --> 04:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
landlords don't even know about it most
 
04:03:49.429 --> 04:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
landlords in New Hampshire are small mom
 
04:03:53.510 --> 04:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
and pop operations they do exactly what
 
04:03:55.110 --> 04:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
Chris was just saying that's what we do
 
04:03:58.870 --> 04:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
in our agency something comes
 
04:04:01.550 --> 04:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
available we say what's the market
 
04:04:04.229 --> 04:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
bearing now we look on Zillow we look on
 
04:04:06.469 --> 04:04:06.479 align:start position:0%
craigslist we see what others and then
 
04:04:07.950 --> 04:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
are offering and say well what's
 
04:04:10.149 --> 04:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
different about that apartment than mine
 
04:04:12.030 --> 04:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
and now if I say well gee that one has
 
04:04:13.510 --> 04:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
the largest square footage or that one
 
04:04:14.910 --> 04:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
looks looks to be in a nicer condition
 
04:04:16.349 --> 04:04:16.359 align:start position:0%
or that one's in a little bit better
 
04:04:19.149 --> 04:04:19.159 align:start position:0%
area and this one's different and I make
 
04:04:20.750 --> 04:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
adjustments for that excuse me that's
 
04:04:22.229 --> 04:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
using an
 
04:04:24.510 --> 04:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
algorithm that's
 
04:04:28.710 --> 04:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
illegal it's like I can't think to set a
 
04:04:30.950 --> 04:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
rent or be in danger of using an
 
04:04:35.389 --> 04:04:35.399 align:start position:0%
algorithm or if I look up a uh ad on a a
 
04:04:37.349 --> 04:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
marketing platform oh excuse me that's
 
04:04:37.359 --> 04:04:38.429 align:start position:0%
marketing platform oh excuse me that's
using

04:04:38.429 --> 04:04:38.439 align:start position:0%
using
 
04:04:40.950 --> 04:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
software if I use my calculator to
 
04:04:42.630 --> 04:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
calculate the numbers that's using
 
04:04:42.640 --> 04:04:44.990 align:start position:0%
calculate the numbers that's using
software

04:04:44.990 --> 04:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
software
 
04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
really if I put numbers on a dart board
 
04:04:49.349 --> 04:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
and throw a
 
04:04:52.950 --> 04:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
dart oh excuse me that's using a process
 
04:04:57.189 --> 04:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
as an algorithm it's just uh I think
 
04:04:59.110 --> 04:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
sorry it's just
 
04:05:03.830 --> 04:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
absurd um it will deinen
 
04:05:06.910 --> 04:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
divize developers and we don't need to
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
do things that tie up developers cause
 
04:05:11.550 --> 04:05:11.560 align:start position:0%
more headache and grief for property
 
04:05:14.269 --> 04:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
owners and disincentivize people from
 
04:05:15.670 --> 04:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
investing in more housing in New
 
04:05:17.429 --> 04:05:17.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there there's so much more I
 
04:05:19.149 --> 04:05:19.159 align:start position:0%
have to stop at some point but I've got
 
04:05:22.830 --> 04:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
pages of of notes on here and I would be
 
04:05:25.309 --> 04:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions well thank
 
04:05:28.110 --> 04:05:28.120 align:start position:0%

04:05:31.149 --> 04:05:31.159 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you I this
 
04:05:33.469 --> 04:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
in um I think we received that via email
 
04:05:37.189 --> 04:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:39.309 --> 04:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
okay all right so is there anyone else
 
04:05:43.990 --> 04:05:44.000 align:start position:0%

public hearing on that um and I will
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on well is
 
04:05:54.550 --> 04:05:54.560 align:start position:0%

here if you do you want me to introduce
 
04:05:58.469 --> 04:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
it if you'd like to introduce it on his
 
04:06:00.950 --> 04:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
behalf did you hear youy quickly have
 
04:06:02.950 --> 04:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
you heard from him today has he asked
 
04:06:02.960 --> 04:06:05.830 align:start position:0%
you heard from him today has he asked
you

04:06:05.830 --> 04:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:06:08.110 --> 04:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
okay okay I'm gonna pause for a minute
 
04:06:10.030 --> 04:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
let the clerk get
 
04:06:12.149 --> 04:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
organized and then yes I'll have you do
 
04:06:22.710 --> 04:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:25.229 --> 04:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
me okay so I want to open up the public
 
04:06:28.510 --> 04:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 628 pring landlords from
 
04:06:29.670 --> 04:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
discriminating against perspective
 
04:06:31.070 --> 04:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
tenants holding certain vouchers under
 
04:06:33.309 --> 04:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
the housing Choice voucher program and I
 
04:06:35.710 --> 04:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
would like to call on representative um
 
04:06:37.950 --> 04:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
Howland who is a co-sponsor um to
 
04:06:39.349 --> 04:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill for representative
 
04:06:39.359 --> 04:06:52.070 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill for representative
Oregan

04:06:52.070 --> 04:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:53.510 --> 04:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
all right I'm not I'm Al Holland from
 
04:06:55.990 --> 04:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
Durham I'm not Timothy Horgan I'll try
 
04:06:58.429 --> 04:06:58.439 align:start position:0%
to do my best quickly to introduce it so
 
04:07:00.830 --> 04:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
the bill really I think is aspirational
 
04:07:03.389 --> 04:07:03.399 align:start position:0%
it's asking not to discriminate against
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh housing Cho Choice vouchers and in
 
04:07:10.269 --> 04:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
the bill on the second page or the third
 
04:07:13.030 --> 04:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
page of it he really lists two real
 
04:07:16.349 --> 04:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
reasons that uh landlords could use to
 
04:07:17.870 --> 04:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
say that they weren't discriminating
 
04:07:20.030 --> 04:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
against the housing Choice vouchers the
 
04:07:21.830 --> 04:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
first one's pretty obvious the rent is
 
04:07:23.429 --> 04:07:23.439 align:start position:0%
more expensive than the voucher and
 
04:07:24.750 --> 04:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
therefore the landlord could say you
 
04:07:26.870 --> 04:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
don't have enough money to pay for it
 
04:07:28.990 --> 04:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
and the second one is that the dwelling
 
04:07:32.229 --> 04:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
unit doesn't comply with Hud's housing
 
04:07:34.630 --> 04:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
standards and so therefore the voucher
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
really wouldn't work for the property
 
04:07:38.510 --> 04:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
and I I think that's all I can do to
 
04:07:40.070 --> 04:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
introduce it I I can try to answer any
 
04:07:43.750 --> 04:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
questions if you really want me to
 
04:07:46.590 --> 04:07:46.600 align:start position:0%
uh yeah feel free to ask questions um
 
04:07:46.600 --> 04:07:48.429 align:start position:0%
uh yeah feel free to ask questions um
representative

04:07:48.429 --> 04:07:48.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair uh and
 
04:07:56.189 --> 04:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
representative Helen um doesn't the uh
 
04:07:58.469 --> 04:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
discrimination against Housing Voucher
 
04:08:00.990 --> 04:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
holders effectively discriminate against
 
04:08:02.990 --> 04:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
families with
 
04:08:07.630 --> 04:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:09.950 --> 04:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
could representative
 
04:08:09.960 --> 04:08:11.630 align:start position:0%
could representative
taxton

04:08:11.630 --> 04:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
taxton
 
04:08:15.389 --> 04:08:15.399 align:start position:0%
so in in looking at at uh the two the
 
04:08:17.030 --> 04:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
two bases
 
04:08:21.830 --> 04:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
for uh not accepting housing and I'm
 
04:08:25.389 --> 04:08:25.399 align:start position:0%
sympathetic because uh to the bill as a
 
04:08:27.590 --> 04:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
as like a as on an aspirational level
 
04:08:29.710 --> 04:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure now we're to the problem of
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
the devil is in the details you know so
 
04:08:35.149 --> 04:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
as a housing provider as part of my
 
04:08:38.309 --> 04:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
regular business I can honestly say I
 
04:08:40.229 --> 04:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
I've never turned anyone down who had a
 
04:08:42.630 --> 04:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
housing voucher for the most part
 
04:08:44.309 --> 04:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
they're good tenants you go back to that
 
04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
whole conversation we had this morning
 
04:08:46.910 --> 04:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
about why would I throw out a good
 
04:08:48.149 --> 04:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
tenant I
 
04:08:51.670 --> 04:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't um but I I but on the other
 
04:08:53.469 --> 04:08:53.479 align:start position:0%
hand I I have a
 
04:08:57.229 --> 04:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
concern primarily about a because I have
 
04:09:01.070 --> 04:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
had that uh situation evolve in the last
 
04:09:03.910 --> 04:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
six months with people who wanted
 
04:09:06.469 --> 04:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
properties who were Section 8 and the or
 
04:09:12.630 --> 04:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
whatever program and uh the uh entity
 
04:09:16.870 --> 04:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
that provided the the the uh the housing
 
04:09:20.550 --> 04:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
voucher said well the rent's too much
 
04:09:23.070 --> 04:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
and the Tenant unfortunately in both of
 
04:09:24.950 --> 04:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
the situations I have in mind said it's
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay I'll cover it out of my share and
 
04:09:29.870 --> 04:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
the housing represent Faxon can we get
 
04:09:32.309 --> 04:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
to the question oh so the question is
 
04:09:35.630 --> 04:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
how with this bill can you reconcile
 
04:09:41.349 --> 04:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
that uh issue of if I the the Housing
 
04:09:44.269 --> 04:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
Authority which administers the voucher
 
04:09:46.870 --> 04:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
cont denying housing or trying to force
 
04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
landlords to lower their rent to what is
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
effectively below the current standards
 
04:09:53.590 --> 04:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
because the rents in the market are
 
04:09:57.030 --> 04:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
going up and they're looking at old
 
04:09:59.790 --> 04:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
data I think the housing Choice vouches
 
04:10:02.830 --> 04:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
are set every year actually so they're
 
04:10:05.309 --> 04:10:05.319 align:start position:0%
relatively uh kept up but I mean I'm not
 
04:10:06.469 --> 04:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
supposed to speak against this bill but
 
04:10:09.070 --> 04:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
I'd say like the one uh problem that I
 
04:10:11.750 --> 04:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
would have in uh the a section would be
 
04:10:14.229 --> 04:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
like if a tenant came to you and and you
 
04:10:17.469 --> 04:10:17.479 align:start position:0%
said the rent was $1,800 a month and the
 
04:10:20.109 --> 04:10:20.119 align:start position:0%
voucher covered $1,800 a month and you
 
04:10:22.630 --> 04:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
didn't rent to that that tenant
 
04:10:28.030 --> 04:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:31.670 --> 04:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination uh representative
 
04:10:33.990 --> 04:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:10:36.910 --> 04:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I don't know if
 
04:10:39.229 --> 04:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
you remember but about a week ago I
 
04:10:43.349 --> 04:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
think to the day we heard about um
 
04:10:43.359 --> 04:10:44.389 align:start position:0%
think to the day we heard about um
another

04:10:44.389 --> 04:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:10:49.429 --> 04:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
bill saying that you couldn't uh cut off
 
04:10:51.910 --> 04:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
or Force electronic payments and that it
 
04:10:53.550 --> 04:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
could be an option but like money was
 
04:10:57.149 --> 04:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
money and so my question is um is the
 
04:10:59.070 --> 04:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
money coming to the landlord from a
 
04:11:01.309 --> 04:11:01.319 align:start position:0%
voucher if you forgive the expression as
 
04:11:03.630 --> 04:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
green as anyone
 
04:11:07.670 --> 04:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
else's uh yeah I mean ideally uh the the
 
04:11:11.109 --> 04:11:11.119 align:start position:0%
vouchers are set at a high enough level
 
04:11:12.750 --> 04:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
that the L there's an incentive for the
 
04:11:15.269 --> 04:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
landlord to rent and still make a profit
 
04:11:19.269 --> 04:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
and I think that's why they adjust
 
04:11:21.309 --> 04:11:21.319 align:start position:0%
yearly representative
 
04:11:24.950 --> 04:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair um having
 
04:11:27.990 --> 04:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
worked at HUD uh for 29 years I just
 
04:11:29.790 --> 04:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
want to say your correct representative
 
04:11:32.510 --> 04:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
H Allen that the fair market rents are
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
adjusted annually representative Gibbs
 
04:11:37.990 --> 04:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's not a question my apologies okay
 
04:11:39.510 --> 04:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
if there are no other
 
04:11:42.790 --> 04:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative Reed thank you
 
04:11:44.389 --> 04:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
again Mr chair and thank you again for
 
04:11:48.149 --> 04:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question If a landlord says
 
04:11:49.550 --> 04:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
that even though I'm going to get the
 
04:11:51.109 --> 04:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
rent that I'm demanding that part of it
 
04:11:52.550 --> 04:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
will come through your voucher program
 
04:11:54.389 --> 04:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
and so I'm going to say that you can't
 
04:11:56.469 --> 04:11:56.479 align:start position:0%
rent this unit wouldn't that be
 
04:11:58.670 --> 04:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
effectively discriminating against
 
04:11:58.680 --> 04:12:01.469 align:start position:0%
effectively discriminating against
lowincome

04:12:01.469 --> 04:12:01.479 align:start position:0%
lowincome
 
04:12:03.429 --> 04:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
people I don't have a good question you
 
04:12:04.590 --> 04:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
can answer that if you'd like I don't
 
04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:05.920 align:start position:0%

member and a an adviser at anagnos realy
 
04:12:30.269 --> 04:12:30.279 align:start position:0%
and development I also serve on the
 
04:12:31.550 --> 04:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
public policy committees for both the
 
04:12:33.870 --> 04:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
state and Commercial investment board um
 
04:12:37.309 --> 04:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
NH is opposed to House Bill 628 um the
 
04:12:38.870 --> 04:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
reasons for this is that currently under
 
04:12:41.149 --> 04:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
both state and federal law a landlord
 
04:12:42.710 --> 04:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
can't discriminate against a potential
 
04:12:44.349 --> 04:12:44.359 align:start position:0%
tenant due to a number of protected
 
04:12:47.429 --> 04:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
categories their age sex gender identity
 
04:12:50.309 --> 04:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
race religion color marital status
 
04:12:52.349 --> 04:12:52.359 align:start position:0%
familial status physical or mental
 
04:12:55.429 --> 04:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
disability disability or national origin
 
04:12:56.990 --> 04:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
and the failure to rent to an individual
 
04:12:58.670 --> 04:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
due to any of these reasons is simply a
 
04:13:00.429 --> 04:13:00.439 align:start position:0%
demonstration of prejudice and it has no
 
04:13:02.510 --> 04:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
place in New Hampshire as Realtors and
 
04:13:04.070 --> 04:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
as human beings we should be opposed to
 
04:13:05.950 --> 04:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
these but choosing not to rent to them
 
04:13:07.750 --> 04:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
due to a voucher holder is materially
 
04:13:10.109 --> 04:13:10.119 align:start position:0%
different from this it's incorrect to
 
04:13:11.510 --> 04:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
treat landlord concerns about the
 
04:13:13.269 --> 04:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
administrative cost of Voucher Program
 
04:13:15.229 --> 04:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
as equivalent to these other forms of
 
04:13:17.070 --> 04:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination participation in a
 
04:13:19.149 --> 04:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
Housing Voucher Program adds a sometimes
 
04:13:21.429 --> 04:13:21.439 align:start position:0%
complex regulatory process which a
 
04:13:22.870 --> 04:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
property owner may not want to subject
 
04:13:24.950 --> 04:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
to themselves as well as a physical
 
04:13:27.429 --> 04:13:27.439 align:start position:0%
inspection and entering of the premises
 
04:13:29.670 --> 04:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh it is reasonable to consider this as
 
04:13:32.269 --> 04:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
a potential way of circumventing the um
 
04:13:33.670 --> 04:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
fourth amendment protection to an
 
04:13:35.590 --> 04:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
unreasonable search and seizure by
 
04:13:38.149 --> 04:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
requiring a landlord to allow people to
 
04:13:41.070 --> 04:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
enter their premises U without a warrant
 
04:13:42.670 --> 04:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
because otherwise they would be
 
04:13:44.510 --> 04:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
considered discriminating and in
 
04:13:47.389 --> 04:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
violation of fair housing PR practices
 
04:13:49.349 --> 04:13:49.359 align:start position:0%
under this bill a landlord would be
 
04:13:51.389 --> 04:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
required to seek from a state or local
 
04:13:52.790 --> 04:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
Housing Authority some guidance on
 
04:13:54.030 --> 04:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not their property meets
 
04:13:57.109 --> 04:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
Hud's quality um standards and an annual
 
04:13:58.590 --> 04:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
inspection and recertification would
 
04:13:59.950 --> 04:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
likely be required with all the
 
04:14:02.189 --> 04:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
necessary paperwork even if it was only
 
04:14:03.790 --> 04:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
an application and they didn't actually
 
04:14:06.149 --> 04:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
have a renter in the
 
04:14:08.469 --> 04:14:08.479 align:start position:0%
unit keep in mind the landlord will also
 
04:14:10.510 --> 04:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
likely need to seek consent for any rent
 
04:14:12.070 --> 04:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
increase from the Housing Authority
 
04:14:13.510 --> 04:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
again and other admin ministrative
 
04:14:16.630 --> 04:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
burden and um another approval process
 
04:14:19.269 --> 04:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
for the unit that they are working with
 
04:14:21.309 --> 04:14:21.319 align:start position:0%
while some landlords appreciate aspects
 
04:14:23.030 --> 04:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
of the voucher programs such as the
 
04:14:24.790 --> 04:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
regularity of the rent payments others
 
04:14:26.349 --> 04:14:26.359 align:start position:0%
choose not to participate due to the
 
04:14:28.189 --> 04:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic requirements of accepting
 
04:14:30.670 --> 04:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
vouchers and that ability to choose to
 
04:14:32.309 --> 04:14:32.319 align:start position:0%
participate or not is the strength of
 
04:14:34.630 --> 04:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
the program I personally have used
 
04:14:37.070 --> 04:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
vouchers um and I still accept them at
 
04:14:39.550 --> 04:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
my properties I found the process to be
 
04:14:41.710 --> 04:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
convenient at times inconvenient at
 
04:14:44.510 --> 04:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
others um and it's not the basis for my
 
04:14:46.670 --> 04:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
decision the answer to our housing
 
04:14:48.990 --> 04:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
crisis is to build more housing not
 
04:14:50.790 --> 04:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
punish landlords and this voucher
 
04:14:52.830 --> 04:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
program has been successful because it
 
04:14:55.630 --> 04:14:55.640 align:start position:0%
is voluntary um and these reasons are a
 
04:14:57.269 --> 04:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
far cry from not renting to someone due
 
04:15:00.429 --> 04:15:00.439 align:start position:0%
to their race gender or national origin
 
04:15:03.990 --> 04:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to also um Echo uh
 
04:15:06.269 --> 04:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
question that uh representative thexton
 
04:15:08.670 --> 04:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
was pointing out um that the devil is in
 
04:15:12.389 --> 04:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
the details and in this section two as
 
04:15:15.750 --> 04:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
the bill is written um it names it as an
 
04:15:18.030 --> 04:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
unlawful discriminatory practice and it
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
has um only two
 
04:15:25.070 --> 04:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
acceptions um to the
 
04:15:27.389 --> 04:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
um to the penalties for it and that's
 
04:15:28.830 --> 04:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
the rent charge for the dwellings above
 
04:15:30.349 --> 04:15:30.359 align:start position:0%
that which the Housing Authority which
 
04:15:31.830 --> 04:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
administers the voucher can lawfully
 
04:15:33.269 --> 04:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
approve and the rent charge for the
 
04:15:34.389 --> 04:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit is the same as the
 
04:15:36.109 --> 04:15:36.119 align:start position:0%
landlord charges in tenants for a
 
04:15:37.389 --> 04:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
comparable unit in the same building or
 
04:15:39.229 --> 04:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
Housing Development or the Housing
 
04:15:40.670 --> 04:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
Authority determines that the dwelling
 
04:15:42.189 --> 04:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
fails to meet the housing quality
 
04:15:43.910 --> 04:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
standards prbly at by the United States
 
04:15:45.030 --> 04:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Housing and urbit
 
04:15:47.070 --> 04:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
Development the problem with this is
 
04:15:49.469 --> 04:15:49.479 align:start position:0%
there's no exception in here for denying
 
04:15:52.389 --> 04:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
the tenant for others filtering criteria
 
04:15:54.870 --> 04:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
of credit of background for eviction
 
04:15:56.790 --> 04:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
history of the way that they treated a
 
04:15:58.990 --> 04:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
unit when they um call for a landlord
 
04:16:00.389 --> 04:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
reference or for their criminal
 
04:16:03.109 --> 04:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
background um so there's nothing
 
04:16:05.349 --> 04:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
clarifying that further in here as well
 
04:16:07.070 --> 04:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
so I'll take any
 
04:16:09.349 --> 04:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
questions um representative
 
04:16:11.630 --> 04:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:16:13.670 --> 04:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:16:16.109 --> 04:16:16.119 align:start position:0%
um are you aware that when we prohibit
 
04:16:18.309 --> 04:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
one form of discrimination it does not
 
04:16:20.429 --> 04:16:20.439 align:start position:0%
prevent you from denying on other basis
 
04:16:23.830 --> 04:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
as you just listed that literally
 
04:16:25.630 --> 04:16:25.640 align:start position:0%
prohibiting one form of discrimination
 
04:16:27.269 --> 04:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
does not actually prevent you from
 
04:16:29.229 --> 04:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
denying someone on another basis
 
04:16:31.269 --> 04:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
discrimination is very specific to that
 
04:16:32.950 --> 04:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
form of
 
04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
discrimination are you aware of that in
 
04:16:37.550 --> 04:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
our law I I'm not seeing anything
 
04:16:39.349 --> 04:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
clarifying this in here okay that's our
 
04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
law I have a followup are you further
 
04:16:45.149 --> 04:16:45.159 align:start position:0%
aware that uh when a landlord rents out
 
04:16:47.950 --> 04:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
a unit that landlord basically does not
 
04:16:50.149 --> 04:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
have any real right other than for
 
04:16:52.950 --> 04:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
emergency repairs over the interior of
 
04:16:55.510 --> 04:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
that unit and so to say that a landlord
 
04:16:57.710 --> 04:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
is somehow being violated for their
 
04:17:00.790 --> 04:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
search and seizure is it it's the tenant
 
04:17:02.349 --> 04:17:02.359 align:start position:0%
the tenant search and seizure when a
 
04:17:04.510 --> 04:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
tenant is occupying a unit are you aware
 
04:17:06.109 --> 04:17:06.119 align:start position:0%
that the landlord doesn't have that
 
04:17:07.950 --> 04:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
right because they've turned over that
 
04:17:09.910 --> 04:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
right to the tenant by fact of that
 
04:17:11.870 --> 04:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
lease actually I'm aware that your
 
04:17:13.710 --> 04:17:13.720 align:start position:0%
question um
 
04:17:15.990 --> 04:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
ignores the fact that none of this even
 
04:17:17.469 --> 04:17:17.479 align:start position:0%
becomes a lease where they've given over
 
04:17:19.670 --> 04:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
that right until they've signed the
 
04:17:21.550 --> 04:17:21.560 align:start position:0%
lease so it's still their property of
 
04:17:23.590 --> 04:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
which they are in possession until they
 
04:17:25.109 --> 04:17:25.119 align:start position:0%
sign that lease and this would make it
 
04:17:27.870 --> 04:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
unlawful for them to exercise that prior
 
04:17:28.910 --> 04:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
to signing a
 
04:17:32.030 --> 04:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
lease okay that doesn't make sense okay
 
04:17:33.550 --> 04:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:17:37.590 --> 04:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair um I'm aware
 
04:17:41.229 --> 04:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
that there can be issues of complicated
 
04:17:43.790 --> 04:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
administrative requirements with renting
 
04:17:45.910 --> 04:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
to Section 8 voucher holders but I
 
04:17:49.990 --> 04:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask you about um one of the
 
04:17:54.389 --> 04:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
protected um uh classes in the current
 
04:17:56.790 --> 04:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law against discrimination
 
04:17:58.830 --> 04:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
and that is familial status as you read
 
04:18:02.189 --> 04:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
it out and familiar status refers to the
 
04:18:05.630 --> 04:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
presence of children in the household so
 
04:18:05.640 --> 04:18:07.750 align:start position:0%
presence of children in the household so
doesn't

04:18:07.750 --> 04:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
04:18:11.109 --> 04:18:11.119 align:start position:0%
um uh discrimination against voucher
 
04:18:13.309 --> 04:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
holders effectively discrimin against
 
04:18:14.429 --> 04:18:14.439 align:start position:0%
families with
 
04:18:16.510 --> 04:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
children uh I don't believe it directly
 
04:18:18.070 --> 04:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
does as a matter of fact the reason why
 
04:18:19.550 --> 04:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
I think that is because one of the
 
04:18:22.469 --> 04:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
voucher holders that I rented to um
 
04:18:25.710 --> 04:18:25.720 align:start position:0%
obtained a voucher for himself and for a
 
04:18:27.070 --> 04:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
domestic partner and there were no
 
04:18:30.830 --> 04:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
children involved um and it's impossible
 
04:18:33.910 --> 04:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
to um State what exactly is going to
 
04:18:36.870 --> 04:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
qualify someone for a voucher um based
 
04:18:39.950 --> 04:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
on fam familial status and familial
 
04:18:41.790 --> 04:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
status as I understand it and
 
04:18:44.429 --> 04:18:44.439 align:start position:0%
discrimination um under that does not
 
04:18:47.670 --> 04:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
just apply to the age or to uh the blood
 
04:18:49.389 --> 04:18:49.399 align:start position:0%
relation it's actually that you can't
 
04:18:52.349 --> 04:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
use the lack of a blood relation um as
 
04:18:55.510 --> 04:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
well as the age of the household members
 
04:18:57.710 --> 04:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs followup uh thank
 
04:18:57.720 --> 04:18:59.149 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs followup uh thank
you

04:18:59.149 --> 04:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:18:59.159 --> 04:19:03.590 align:start position:0%
you
um

04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:07.309 --> 04:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh isn't true that if you look up the
 
04:19:09.990 --> 04:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
definition of familial status in the law
 
04:19:11.950 --> 04:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
against discrimination you'll find that
 
04:19:14.189 --> 04:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
it refers only to the presence of
 
04:19:16.269 --> 04:19:16.279 align:start position:0%
children in the household not to whether
 
04:19:18.469 --> 04:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
or not people are blood blood relations
 
04:19:20.670 --> 04:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
or marital relations or whatever else
 
04:19:22.630 --> 04:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
representative I'm really
 
04:19:24.990 --> 04:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
confused at this line of questioning I
 
04:19:27.910 --> 04:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
think he's answered it I'm I'm confused
 
04:19:29.189 --> 04:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
at what you're trying to get at so if
 
04:19:31.750 --> 04:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
you have a direct question I understand
 
04:19:33.630 --> 04:19:33.640 align:start position:0%
I think he's answered your question if
 
04:19:36.109 --> 04:19:36.119 align:start position:0%
you have a different one Mr Shar I don't
 
04:19:38.550 --> 04:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
think he has yet
 
04:19:41.309 --> 04:19:41.319 align:start position:0%
um if you look up the definition of
 
04:19:43.750 --> 04:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
familial status what do what does the
 
04:19:48.269 --> 04:19:48.279 align:start position:0%
law say uh I'm not sure if it does uh
 
04:19:50.269 --> 04:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
only refer to age in this case and if it
 
04:19:54.389 --> 04:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
does um I understand that um that
 
04:19:56.950 --> 04:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
affects the ability or inability of a
 
04:19:58.349 --> 04:19:58.359 align:start position:0%
landlord to make a decision on that
 
04:20:00.750 --> 04:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
criteria as it should um but I don't
 
04:20:03.149 --> 04:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
believe that that necessarily has any
 
04:20:05.550 --> 04:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
Merit to it being tied to a voucher
 
04:20:07.550 --> 04:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
program specifically since voucher
 
04:20:10.429 --> 04:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
programs are available to people uh that
 
04:20:12.269 --> 04:20:12.279 align:start position:0%
are single that are in a domestic
 
04:20:15.030 --> 04:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
partnership or have children and have uh
 
04:20:17.149 --> 04:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
and many more circumstances it's not
 
04:20:19.630 --> 04:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
tied just to
 
04:20:24.630 --> 04:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
families um one more yes that's
 
04:20:28.109 --> 04:20:28.119 align:start position:0%
it um I realize that you can only speak
 
04:20:30.189 --> 04:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
of what your knowledge is and I realize
 
04:20:32.309 --> 04:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
that that may be limited but in fact
 
04:20:35.590 --> 04:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
don't most of the VOR holders um aren't
 
04:20:37.790 --> 04:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
most of them families with children I'm
 
04:20:39.070 --> 04:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
entirely unaware of what those
 
04:20:39.080 --> 04:20:40.269 align:start position:0%
entirely unaware of what those
statistics

04:20:40.269 --> 04:20:40.279 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
04:20:43.710 --> 04:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
are thank you any other questions seeing
 
04:20:44.950 --> 04:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
none thank
 
04:20:54.990 --> 04:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:57.590 --> 04:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
blae thank you Mr chair members of the

tasked by the council membership to read
 
04:21:09.309 --> 04:21:09.319 align:start position:0%
this letter into record our council
 
04:21:11.590 --> 04:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
members believe that house bill 628
 
04:21:13.149 --> 04:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
would have a positive imp impact on
 
04:21:15.070 --> 04:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
disabled people their families and those
 
04:21:17.469 --> 04:21:17.479 align:start position:0%
who support them according to the most
 
04:21:19.870 --> 04:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
recent UNH Institute on disability

compendium over 12% of New Hampshire
 
04:21:24.590 --> 04:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
residents are currently living with a
 
04:21:26.630 --> 04:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
disability it is more essential than
 
04:21:29.309 --> 04:21:29.319 align:start position:0%
ever to continue to support policy that
 
04:21:31.590 --> 04:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
increases inclusion and enhances the
 
04:21:34.469 --> 04:21:34.479 align:start position:0%

residents the DD Council membership
 
04:21:39.030 --> 04:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
believes strongly that it is important
 
04:21:40.990 --> 04:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
to prohibit housing discrimination
 
04:21:43.030 --> 04:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
against people with disabilities
 
04:21:45.309 --> 04:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
in the Statewide Housing Voucher Program
 
04:21:46.790 --> 04:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
operated by the New Hampshire Housing
 
04:21:49.109 --> 04:21:49.119 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority it is estimated that
 
04:21:49.119 --> 04:21:50.550 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority it is estimated that
approximately

04:21:50.550 --> 04:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
04:21:53.510 --> 04:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
66% of assisted households are headed by
 
04:21:54.750 --> 04:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
a person with
 
04:21:57.229 --> 04:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
disabilities the voucher program allows
 
04:22:00.429 --> 04:22:00.439 align:start position:0%
tenants to obtain housing and pay 30% of
 
04:22:03.349 --> 04:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
their income as a portion of their rent
 
04:22:05.670 --> 04:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
local housing authorities using Federal
 
04:22:07.950 --> 04:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
HUD funds pay the remainder of the
 
04:22:10.710 --> 04:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
contracted rent the demand for vouchers
 
04:22:12.630 --> 04:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
is so high that applicants are waiting
 
04:22:16.550 --> 04:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
up to seven years to get one in addition
 
04:22:18.710 --> 04:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
to the long wait times to receive a
 
04:22:21.389 --> 04:22:21.399 align:start position:0%
voucher many people lose their voucher
 
04:22:24.070 --> 04:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity because countless landlords
 
04:22:26.870 --> 04:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
simply refuse to accept them or they
 
04:22:28.870 --> 04:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
can't find a landlord who will accept
 
04:22:32.750 --> 04:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
them within 90 to 120 days required this
 
04:22:35.189 --> 04:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
is especially difficult when disabled
 
04:22:37.950 --> 04:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
people rely on certain housing
 
04:22:42.590 --> 04:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
accommodations the CDC reports that 0.15
 
04:22:45.950 --> 04:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
% of housing in the US is wheelchair
 
04:22:49.590 --> 04:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
accessible yet one in four people in the
 
04:22:51.950 --> 04:22:51.960 align:start position:0%

type of Mobility
 
04:22:57.109 --> 04:22:57.119 align:start position:0%
challenge HB 628 would make it unlawful
 
04:22:58.990 --> 04:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
to refuse to accept housing Choice
 
04:23:01.830 --> 04:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
voucher holders as tenants solely be
 
04:23:03.070 --> 04:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
because they are receiving this
 
04:23:05.910 --> 04:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
financial support landlords can still
 
04:23:08.670 --> 04:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
screen tenants and apply other criteria
 
04:23:11.510 --> 04:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
for not selecting tenants for example if
 
04:23:14.790 --> 04:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
the rent for the apartment is high or if
 
04:23:17.229 --> 04:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
the it is not approved by the HUD
 
04:23:18.750 --> 04:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
minimum quality
 
04:23:21.590 --> 04:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
standards these are only a couple of
 
04:23:24.070 --> 04:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
examples landlords should not be allowed
 
04:23:26.189 --> 04:23:26.199 align:start position:0%
to deny tency because they hold a
 
04:23:29.030 --> 04:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
housing Choice voucher the DD Council
 
04:23:32.030 --> 04:23:32.040 align:start position:0%

04:23:33.670 --> 04:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
more opportunities for people with
 
04:23:36.550 --> 04:23:36.560 align:start position:0%

engaged with and want to continue to

work with the state's legislators
 
04:24:08.309 --> 04:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
including on the special committee on
 
04:24:11.750 --> 04:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
housing an HB 1168 committee to study
 
04:24:13.469 --> 04:24:13.479 align:start position:0%
the effects that the housing crisis has
 
04:24:15.030 --> 04:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
had on people with
 
04:24:17.550 --> 04:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities it is policies like this
 
04:24:19.630 --> 04:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
that could be one of the many tools that
 
04:24:22.109 --> 04:24:22.119 align:start position:0%
we can use to combat this crisis we
 
04:24:23.670 --> 04:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
04:24:25.149 --> 04:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you for your
 
04:24:27.950 --> 04:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
testimony questions representative Reed
 
04:24:29.630 --> 04:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:24:32.149 --> 04:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
my question as context for this question
 
04:24:34.670 --> 04:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
I'm currently dealing um helping a group
 
04:24:37.469 --> 04:24:37.479 align:start position:0%
of residents in my town legally um with
 
04:24:40.429 --> 04:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
a landlord of theirs who has openly said
 
04:24:42.710 --> 04:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
and his employees have openly said that
 
04:24:45.109 --> 04:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
they would like uh more able-bodied and
 
04:24:48.550 --> 04:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
younger people um both of which are um
 
04:24:52.950 --> 04:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
protected classes so the question is is
 
04:24:55.750 --> 04:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
can you foresee the fact that landlords
 
04:24:58.109 --> 04:24:58.119 align:start position:0%
can discriminate on the basis of
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
vouchers can you foresee the idea that
 
04:25:03.030 --> 04:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
landlords would use that as an excuse to
 
04:25:05.830 --> 04:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
discriminate against protected classes
 
04:25:07.149 --> 04:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
which would be illegal for them to
 
04:25:08.830 --> 04:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
discriminate against so if there's a lot
 
04:25:11.670 --> 04:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
of people for example with disabilities
 
04:25:14.469 --> 04:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
who get V cures and the landlord doesn't
 
04:25:15.950 --> 04:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
want someone with disabilities either
 
04:25:18.149 --> 04:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
developmental or physical disabilities
 
04:25:19.830 --> 04:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
that they could say because it would be
 
04:25:21.830 --> 04:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
illegal for them to say I'm not going to
 
04:25:23.109 --> 04:25:23.119 align:start position:0%
accept you on the basis of your
 
04:25:25.469 --> 04:25:25.479 align:start position:0%
disability but perfectly legal for them
 
04:25:27.790 --> 04:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
to say you have a voucher I'm not going
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
to take it can you foresee that being
 
04:25:33.550 --> 04:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
used in that way yes I
 
04:25:37.030 --> 04:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
can representative Gibbs thank you Mr
 
04:25:38.510 --> 04:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for coming in to
 
04:25:40.309 --> 04:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
testify this
 
04:25:43.670 --> 04:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon um where there or not the use
 
04:25:46.109 --> 04:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
of discrimination uh against voucher
 
04:25:48.309 --> 04:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
holders is a pretext for something else
 
04:25:49.830 --> 04:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
as representative
 
04:25:53.030 --> 04:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
redescribed um given the fact that one
 
04:25:56.109 --> 04:25:56.119 align:start position:0%
of the groups protected um under the
 
04:25:57.510 --> 04:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
current New Hampshire law against
 
04:25:59.189 --> 04:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
discrimination is people with
 
04:26:02.109 --> 04:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities and given the fact that so
 
04:26:05.109 --> 04:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
many voucher holders uh are or include
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
in their families a person with
 
04:26:09.590 --> 04:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities doesn't discrimination
 
04:26:11.550 --> 04:26:11.560 align:start position:0%
against voucher holders effectively
 
04:26:13.590 --> 04:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
discriminate against people with
 
04:26:17.149 --> 04:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
disabilities we believe that it does yes
 
04:26:17.159 --> 04:26:18.910 align:start position:0%
disabilities we believe that it does yes
thank

04:26:18.910 --> 04:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:26:21.910 --> 04:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
you other questions seeing none thank
 
04:26:30.710 --> 04:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:33.070 --> 04:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
Norman thank you once again for another
 
04:26:36.269 --> 04:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak before the housing
 
04:26:40.389 --> 04:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
committee uh last night I did send out
 
04:26:43.030 --> 04:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
through email uh the test testimony that
 
04:26:45.269 --> 04:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
I have here so you have that in
 
04:26:47.750 --> 04:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
electronic form there is one printed
 
04:26:51.030 --> 04:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
copy here if you want me to turn it in I
 
04:26:54.830 --> 04:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
can uh there's certainly no way that in
 
04:26:57.189 --> 04:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
any reasonable amount of time I could go
 
04:27:00.590 --> 04:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
over all of the reasons why this should
 
04:27:06.790 --> 04:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
be um not allowed we certainly oppose
 
04:27:11.229 --> 04:27:11.239 align:start position:0%
the bill the primary problem here is
 
04:27:14.630 --> 04:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
that the the Section 8
 
04:27:20.109 --> 04:27:20.119 align:start position:0%
hcv program is is quite onerous in its
 
04:27:23.309 --> 04:27:23.319 align:start position:0%
Administration and added
 
04:27:26.870 --> 04:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
costs um that and it's just a large
 
04:27:29.990 --> 04:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
government contract I think it's
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to think that it's okay
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
that the government can force an
 
04:27:38.790 --> 04:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
individual private citizen into signing
 
04:27:41.030 --> 04:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
a government contract that they have no
 
04:27:45.469 --> 04:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:46.870 --> 04:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
then there
 
04:27:49.670 --> 04:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
are large amounts of extra cost
 
04:27:52.469 --> 04:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
associated with taking a section 81
 
04:27:55.229 --> 04:27:55.239 align:start position:0%
it we can get into those if you
 
04:28:00.429 --> 04:28:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:02.469 --> 04:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
expensive I'm pausing because there's
 
04:28:06.429 --> 04:28:06.439 align:start position:0%
just so much I'm not sure what to say um
 
04:28:09.030 --> 04:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
the issue here is a shortage of housing
 
04:28:11.469 --> 04:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
not and the owner nature of this Section
 
04:28:13.269 --> 04:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
8 program
 
04:28:17.510 --> 04:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
a way better solution would be to create
 
04:28:21.030 --> 04:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
a loss mitigation fund the state could
 
04:28:23.389 --> 04:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
create a loss mitigation fund other
 
04:28:26.910 --> 04:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
states have done this to help reimburse
 
04:28:30.990 --> 04:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
the costs that are um incurred when a
 
04:28:35.870 --> 04:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
housing provider takes on a hcv
 
04:28:37.910 --> 04:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
tenant if that's something you want to
 
04:28:40.189 --> 04:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
consider I I would be very happy to work
 
04:28:42.309 --> 04:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
with you and our team would be as well
 
04:28:45.030 --> 04:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
there was a bill last season that was
 
04:28:47.070 --> 04:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
talking to that
 
04:28:49.710 --> 04:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
effect let's see what
 
04:28:52.269 --> 04:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
else there's no allowance in this bill
 
04:28:54.590 --> 04:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
by the way for Resident owner occupied
 
04:28:57.149 --> 04:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
Pro providers like there's no mention of
 
04:29:00.030 --> 04:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
restricted non-restricted so every
 
04:29:02.830 --> 04:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
single residential housing provider
 
04:29:05.870 --> 04:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
would be bound by by the provisions
 
04:29:09.510 --> 04:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
here section I'm sorry not Section 8 but
 
04:29:12.590 --> 04:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
HUD is is the biggest problem with this
 
04:29:12.600 --> 04:29:14.229 align:start position:0%
HUD is is the biggest problem with this
because

04:29:14.229 --> 04:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:29:19.030 --> 04:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
HUD writes rules and regulations that by
 
04:29:21.830 --> 04:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
virtue of having a Section 8 lease which
 
04:29:24.229 --> 04:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
has the hap
 
04:29:26.630 --> 04:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
contract a housing provider would be
 
04:29:29.429 --> 04:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
bound by those changes in rules and
 
04:29:31.790 --> 04:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
regulations that again they have no to
 
04:29:36.590 --> 04:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
say over one of them for instance is the
 
04:29:40.349 --> 04:29:40.359 align:start position:0%
cares act um was which was in place
 
04:29:44.030 --> 04:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
during covid had a provision ision that
 
04:29:45.790 --> 04:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
if you were evicting for
 
04:29:48.710 --> 04:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
non-payment the uh eviction notice would
 
04:29:50.830 --> 04:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
have to be extended from the Hampshire 7
 
04:29:55.229 --> 04:29:55.239 align:start position:0%
days to 30 days an extra
 
04:30:02.710 --> 04:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:05.670 --> 04:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
expense I I would encourage you to look
 
04:30:08.510 --> 04:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
through this I I think it was nine pages
 
04:30:14.109 --> 04:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:17.469 --> 04:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
reasons why the program itself is the
 
04:30:21.750 --> 04:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
problem now if if you wanted to have a
 
04:30:24.550 --> 04:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
loss mitigation fund to help reimburse
 
04:30:26.550 --> 04:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
those costs that would be that would be
 
04:30:29.670 --> 04:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
workable that would actually incentivize
 
04:30:31.870 --> 04:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
housing providers to accept the program
 
04:30:34.830 --> 04:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
that's what we need to do is incentivize
 
04:30:37.710 --> 04:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
housing providers to accept using the
 
04:30:39.870 --> 04:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
program not not Ram it down their
 
04:30:42.030 --> 04:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
throats I don't know if you know this
 
04:30:45.630 --> 04:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
but under RRP rules which has to do with
 
04:30:48.590 --> 04:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
renovating uh properties F before 1978
 
04:30:51.309 --> 04:30:51.319 align:start position:0%
and properly handling lead paint the
 
04:30:54.510 --> 04:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions for uh that that program
 
04:30:56.790 --> 04:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
has two sides EPA side and HUD side if
 
04:30:58.870 --> 04:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
you have a section 81 it you're bound by
 
04:31:01.030 --> 04:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
the Huds side of the rule which has many
 
04:31:04.309 --> 04:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
many more expenses and costs the uh the
 
04:31:06.710 --> 04:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
expenses and cost just you know they
 
04:31:09.469 --> 04:31:09.479 align:start position:0%
keep they keep going so I I'm going to
 
04:31:11.349 --> 04:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
have to stop I think because I'm not
 
04:31:13.670 --> 04:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
covering probably even 10% of what's in
 
04:31:15.870 --> 04:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
here against why housing providers
 
04:31:18.070 --> 04:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
should not be forced into a government
 
04:31:20.590 --> 04:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
contract that's expensive and it will
 
04:31:22.910 --> 04:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
only increase the cost which then get
 
04:31:25.750 --> 04:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
translated onto higher rents and we just
 
04:31:28.149 --> 04:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
don't need higher rents in our Market
 
04:31:33.229 --> 04:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
I'd be very happy so very happy to take
 
04:31:35.189 --> 04:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
questions okay um thank you for your
 
04:31:37.750 --> 04:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
testimony represent Reed thank you Mr
 
04:31:40.269 --> 04:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr Norman for taking my
 
04:31:43.269 --> 04:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
question are you aware of and can you
 
04:31:46.149 --> 04:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
accurately Define the term rent seeking
 
04:31:48.269 --> 04:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
Behavior because when you not once but
 
04:31:50.830 --> 04:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
twice suggest a government program to
 
04:31:54.550 --> 04:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
pay uh landlords to cover costs related
 
04:31:56.389 --> 04:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
to their business in addition to the
 
04:31:57.990 --> 04:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
existing government program which pays
 
04:32:00.229 --> 04:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
the rents for some people that's the
 
04:32:02.189 --> 04:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
term that comes to mind so maybe you can
 
04:32:04.670 --> 04:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
accurately Define that term what's the
 
04:32:07.670 --> 04:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
term the term is rent seeking behavior
 
04:32:08.990 --> 04:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
and since I'm only allowed to ask
 
04:32:10.510 --> 04:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
questions I would encourage the entire
 
04:32:13.389 --> 04:32:13.399 align:start position:0%
committee to look up that term
 
04:32:15.550 --> 04:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know that term rent
 
04:32:18.870 --> 04:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
seeking Behavior I know that the section
 
04:32:23.510 --> 04:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
H HUD program forces many many
 
04:32:25.389 --> 04:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
additional costs and burdens in
 
04:32:28.910 --> 04:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
administrations if you look at leasing a
 
04:32:31.550 --> 04:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
residential Market lease you have this
 
04:32:33.510 --> 04:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
many conditions and procedures to go
 
04:32:35.109 --> 04:32:35.119 align:start position:0%
through if you look at renting Section 8
 
04:32:38.229 --> 04:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
it's probably four times the
 
04:32:41.389 --> 04:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
process representative Gibbs thank you
 
04:32:43.910 --> 04:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
Mr shair and thank you for coming again
 
04:32:45.790 --> 04:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
to testify to the
 
04:32:48.070 --> 04:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
committee uh you mentioned the need to
 
04:32:51.269 --> 04:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
protect owner occupied buildings doesn't
 
04:32:52.870 --> 04:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire law against
 
04:32:54.990 --> 04:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination already contain
 
04:32:57.510 --> 04:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
Provisions exempting small owner
 
04:32:57.520 --> 04:32:58.790 align:start position:0%
Provisions exempting small owner
occupied

04:32:58.790 --> 04:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
occupied
 
04:33:03.429 --> 04:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
buildings so in the RSA 540 there are
 
04:33:04.910 --> 04:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
definitions of restricted and
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
non-restricted maybe that is what you're
 
04:33:11.910 --> 04:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
referring to follow up um isn't the New
 
04:33:13.990 --> 04:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law against discrimination not
 
04:33:20.629 --> 04:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:23.830 --> 04:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
354a that one I don't know but what I
 
04:33:26.429 --> 04:33:26.439 align:start position:0%
see written in this bill is the
 
04:33:29.189 --> 04:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
definition of landlord would include all
 
04:33:32.789 --> 04:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
landlords that rent out
 
04:33:35.070 --> 04:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
Apartments it doesn't carve out an
 
04:33:37.429 --> 04:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
exception for owner occupi or what we
 
04:33:39.390 --> 04:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
would normally call restricted owners
 
04:33:42.349 --> 04:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
isn't this bill an amendment to RSA
 
04:33:42.359 --> 04:33:46.189 align:start position:0%
isn't this bill an amendment to RSA
354a

04:33:46.189 --> 04:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:51.869 --> 04:33:51.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:55.150 --> 04:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
well doesn't it start out saying amend
 
04:33:59.230 --> 04:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
RSA 354 A10 354
 
04:34:03.070 --> 04:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
810 it does indeed line
 
04:34:05.830 --> 04:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
one okay there's a place in here that
 
04:34:07.910 --> 04:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
defines the landlord I'd have to look
 
04:34:09.949 --> 04:34:09.959 align:start position:0%
through it again
 
04:34:12.750 --> 04:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
so perhaps this is in the wrong area of
 
04:34:15.750 --> 04:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
the rsas but thank you representative
 
04:34:16.990 --> 04:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
gives for poting that out representative
 
04:34:18.750 --> 04:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
buo can I can I just make like a point
 
04:34:21.949 --> 04:34:21.959 align:start position:0%
of order um maybe just directing on on
 
04:34:25.510 --> 04:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
page two line 22 where it's section 22
 
04:34:27.269 --> 04:34:27.279 align:start position:0%
um where it says rental of a housing
 
04:34:28.269 --> 04:34:28.279 align:start position:0%
accommodation in a building which
 
04:34:30.109 --> 04:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
contains housing of not more than four
 
04:34:31.551 --> 04:34:31.561 align:start position:0%
families and depending of each other if
 
04:34:33.869 --> 04:34:33.879 align:start position:0%
owner resides in one of the housing
 
04:34:35.709 --> 04:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
accommodations so I think that's what
 
04:34:37.990 --> 04:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
everyone was trying to find but I do
 
04:34:39.310 --> 04:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
have a question go ahead ask your
 
04:34:41.949 --> 04:34:41.959 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman
 
04:34:45.150 --> 04:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
um so my my question is on these two if
 
04:34:46.990 --> 04:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation were to pass on these
 
04:34:49.070 --> 04:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
two proposed exemptions where there's
 
04:34:51.109 --> 04:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
one if the rent is higher than what the
 
04:34:53.709 --> 04:34:53.719 align:start position:0%
voucher amount is for or if the H if the
 
04:34:56.349 --> 04:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
dwelling fails to meet housing quality
 
04:35:00.551 --> 04:35:00.561 align:start position:0%
standards in order to not take a voucher
 
04:35:02.029 --> 04:35:02.039 align:start position:0%
if you had a housing provider that did
 
04:35:04.310 --> 04:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
not want to go through the burden of
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
taking one of these vouchers doesn't
 
04:35:07.510 --> 04:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation create a perverse
 
04:35:09.750 --> 04:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
incentive to either raise rents to be
 
04:35:11.949 --> 04:35:11.959 align:start position:0%
more than the voucher or if you have a
 
04:35:13.429 --> 04:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
unit that does not meet housing quality
 
04:35:15.750 --> 04:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
standards do not improve the quality
 
04:35:18.869 --> 04:35:18.879 align:start position:0%
standards so you're just to clarify your
 
04:35:22.029 --> 04:35:22.039 align:start position:0%
question are you asking if this bill
 
04:35:24.390 --> 04:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
were to pass yes would it incentivize
 
04:35:27.029 --> 04:35:27.039 align:start position:0%
incen landlords to in fact it would
 
04:35:29.750 --> 04:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
incentivize a price War it would
 
04:35:32.230 --> 04:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
incentivize the housing provider to
 
04:35:36.670 --> 04:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
price their rent above the the number
 
04:35:38.789 --> 04:35:38.799 align:start position:0%
that the program
 
04:35:41.629 --> 04:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
accepts and then the program would come
 
04:35:43.230 --> 04:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
come back a little bit later saying
 
04:35:45.230 --> 04:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
let's review what Market rents are
 
04:35:47.551 --> 04:35:47.561 align:start position:0%
here's the market rent okay now we
 
04:35:49.590 --> 04:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
approve this number then the housing
 
04:35:51.910 --> 04:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
provider was say okay well now I need to
 
04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
raise the rent higher so that I'm not in
 
04:35:59.990 --> 04:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
the program or yes uh in it would be a
 
04:36:02.189 --> 04:36:02.199 align:start position:0%
little bit harder to imagine someone
 
04:36:03.750 --> 04:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
would do it but yeah I think it would
 
04:36:06.990 --> 04:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
incentivize someone to leave the
 
04:36:09.510 --> 04:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
property condition in a way that that
 
04:36:14.709 --> 04:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
meets code but leaves it in a way that
 
04:36:17.709 --> 04:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be accepted by Section 8 and
 
04:36:17.719 --> 04:36:19.230 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be accepted by Section 8 and
thereby

04:36:19.230 --> 04:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
thereby
 
04:36:22.670 --> 04:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
not providing better quality
 
04:36:26.070 --> 04:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
housing representative Reed thank you Mr
 
04:36:28.390 --> 04:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
chair thank you again so just to clarify
 
04:36:32.029 --> 04:36:32.039 align:start position:0%
what you just said to not renovate so
 
04:36:35.310 --> 04:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
that it's up to that standard but still
 
04:36:37.551 --> 04:36:37.561 align:start position:0%
meets code so you're saying that there
 
04:36:40.510 --> 04:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
is still a bare minimum code to which
 
04:36:43.310 --> 04:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
everyone has to adhere right so it
 
04:36:44.470 --> 04:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be like they would be in
 
04:36:46.830 --> 04:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
shambles am I hearing you correctly well
 
04:36:49.429 --> 04:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
naturally Section 8 requires things that
 
04:36:52.670 --> 04:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
are Beyond
 
04:36:54.869 --> 04:36:54.879 align:start position:0%
normal thank you any other questions
 
04:36:57.470 --> 04:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank
 
04:37:11.789 --> 04:37:11.799 align:start position:0%

can access stable and affordable housing
 
04:37:51.109 --> 04:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
despite the programs intent individuals
 
04:37:54.109 --> 04:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:56.869 --> 04:37:56.879 align:start position:0%
vouchers face significant barriers often
 
04:37:59.070 --> 04:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
being rejected outright by landlords
 
04:38:01.551 --> 04:38:01.561 align:start position:0%
based solely on their source of income
 
04:38:03.310 --> 04:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
the demand for affordable housing in New
 
04:38:05.551 --> 04:38:05.561 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is substantial according to
 
04:38:06.869 --> 04:38:06.879 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Housing Finance
 
04:38:09.310 --> 04:38:09.320 align:start position:0%

04:38:22.551 --> 04:38:22.561 align:start position:0%
issued
 
04:38:26.510 --> 04:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
1,581 vouchers but nearly 300 expired
 
04:38:29.109 --> 04:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
before being used largely due to
 
04:38:30.789 --> 04:38:30.799 align:start position:0%
difficulty of finding landlords willing
 
04:38:33.789 --> 04:38:33.799 align:start position:0%
to accept them additionally local
 
04:38:35.590 --> 04:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
housing authorities report extensive
 
04:38:38.109 --> 04:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
weight lists for housing assistance for
 
04:38:39.830 --> 04:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
example the Keen Housing Authority
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
currently has 853 applicants on its wait
 
04:38:45.109 --> 04:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
list these figures underscore the
 
04:38:47.390 --> 04:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
immense challenges voucher holders face
 
04:38:49.949 --> 04:38:49.959 align:start position:0%
in Access accessing stable housing in
 
04:38:53.109 --> 04:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
the state discrimination against voucher
 
04:38:55.470 --> 04:38:55.480 align:start position:0%

04:39:00.349 --> 04:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
according to a 2022 study by the urban

Institute landlords routinely reject
 
04:39:05.551 --> 04:39:05.561 align:start position:0%
tenants with vouchers citing stigma and
 
04:39:07.390 --> 04:39:07.400 align:start position:0%

issue is notably severe over 40% of
 
04:39:22.429 --> 04:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
voucher holders Nationwide are people
 
04:39:24.830 --> 04:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
with disabilities when landlords refuse
 
04:39:26.750 --> 04:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
to accept vouchers individuals with
 
04:39:28.949 --> 04:39:28.959 align:start position:0%

costly Emergency Services House Bill 628
 
04:40:01.708 --> 04:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
is an important step towards ensuring

fairness in New Hampshire's housing
 
04:40:06.830 --> 04:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
market and Abel would be um happy to
 
04:40:09.270 --> 04:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
work with the legislature to streamline
 
04:40:13.230 --> 04:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
the voucher Pro process with uh for
 
04:40:15.550 --> 04:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
landlords thank you for your time thank
 
04:40:17.150 --> 04:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony
 
04:40:20.510 --> 04:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
04:40:30.310 --> 04:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:33.868 --> 04:40:33.878 align:start position:0%
kle turn your mic on for us please I
 
04:40:36.430 --> 04:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
have rental units in the SE Coast Area I
 
04:40:39.868 --> 04:40:39.878 align:start position:0%
do currently have four voucher holders
 
04:40:42.670 --> 04:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
as tenants and I've had them for years
 
04:40:45.390 --> 04:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
um one of the concerns that I have is
 
04:40:47.230 --> 04:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
that one of the differences between
 
04:40:48.948 --> 04:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
someone who has a voucher and someone
 
04:40:51.310 --> 04:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
who does not is being able to screen
 
04:40:53.708 --> 04:40:53.718 align:start position:0%
those tenants one of the worst things I
 
04:40:56.230 --> 04:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
had to do as a landlord was go into my
 
04:40:58.350 --> 04:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
parking lot and pick up hypodermic
 
04:41:00.230 --> 04:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
syringes that were left by people who
 
04:41:02.270 --> 04:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
were shooting up drugs because a tenant
 
04:41:04.670 --> 04:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
was selling drugs we couldn't prove it
 
04:41:06.708 --> 04:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
but there was happening those are
 
04:41:08.350 --> 04:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
extremely dangerous to pick up you don't
 
04:41:10.350 --> 04:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
know what what was on them what people
 
04:41:12.070 --> 04:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
used and you don't know what diseases
 
04:41:13.948 --> 04:41:13.958 align:start position:0%
are there and I had to pick them up
 
04:41:15.590 --> 04:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
because I couldn't leave them because
 
04:41:17.550 --> 04:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
potentially children could pick them up
 
04:41:19.030 --> 04:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
and play with them and none of us want
 
04:41:21.510 --> 04:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
to see a child injured on that grounds
 
04:41:23.470 --> 04:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
so it becomes critical to me that I have
 
04:41:26.230 --> 04:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
the ability to screen tenants one of the
 
04:41:28.708 --> 04:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
problems with a voucher holders or let
 
04:41:31.150 --> 04:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
me back up excuse me things that we use
 
04:41:32.868 --> 04:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
to screen tenants whether or not they
 
04:41:35.310 --> 04:41:35.320 align:start position:0%
have credit they have a landlord
 
04:41:38.150 --> 04:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
reference employment reference and
 
04:41:40.590 --> 04:41:40.600 align:start position:0%
possibly criminal history part of the
 
04:41:42.830 --> 04:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
problem with the voucher housers is by
 
04:41:44.868 --> 04:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
nature they lower income or they
 
04:41:46.868 --> 04:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to get the voucher they
 
04:41:48.708 --> 04:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
don't have credit it's not their fault
 
04:41:51.948 --> 04:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
it just happens landlord references some
 
04:41:54.628 --> 04:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
of them do some of them don't again if
 
04:41:57.390 --> 04:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
someone's been on not been without
 
04:41:58.750 --> 04:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
housing for a period of time they won't
 
04:42:00.670 --> 04:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
have a current landlord reference
 
04:42:03.190 --> 04:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
employment reference again it's a hit or
 
04:42:05.310 --> 04:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
miss it might be part-time employment
 
04:42:07.590 --> 04:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
one two of my Section 8 tenants now do
 
04:42:09.190 --> 04:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
have part-time employment and we were
 
04:42:11.628 --> 04:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
able to get them and a criminal it's Hit
 
04:42:13.190 --> 04:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
or Miss what you're going to be able to
 
04:42:16.030 --> 04:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
get if we just say wait a minute we
 
04:42:17.788 --> 04:42:17.798 align:start position:0%
don't have that credit reference we
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
don't have a landlord reference it may
 
04:42:22.030 --> 04:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
bring it up to enough of a percentage
 
04:42:24.070 --> 04:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
that there's this Theory called
 
04:42:25.830 --> 04:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
disparate uh
 
04:42:28.270 --> 04:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination and that we cannot
 
04:42:30.830 --> 04:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
protect ourselves from at all there are
 
04:42:34.190 --> 04:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
instances where HUD or U Human Rights
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
Commission has used this Theory saying
 
04:42:38.470 --> 04:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
well it's causing you not to be able to
 
04:42:41.390 --> 04:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
take 30 or 40% of these people and
 
04:42:43.310 --> 04:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
therefore it's a discrimination and you
 
04:42:45.590 --> 04:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be allowed to do it well that
 
04:42:47.628 --> 04:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
takes away all my tools to determine
 
04:42:48.990 --> 04:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is a person who's
 
04:42:51.390 --> 04:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
going to fit in or this is going to be a
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
person who's going to be a real problem
 
04:42:55.230 --> 04:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
for me and it was raised by one of the
 
04:42:57.350 --> 04:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
other speakers too so that that's
 
04:42:59.948 --> 04:42:59.958 align:start position:0%
important to us and that something be
 
04:43:02.708 --> 04:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
dealt with and addressed in this bill or
 
04:43:05.830 --> 04:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
you determine not to pass the Bill
 
04:43:07.788 --> 04:43:07.798 align:start position:0%
another issue I have is there's no limit
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
to the number or the percentage of a
 
04:43:12.670 --> 04:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
building that I have to rent out two
 
04:43:15.070 --> 04:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
people on vouchers it has been shown
 
04:43:17.868 --> 04:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
that they do better if there's a mix
 
04:43:19.910 --> 04:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
between people working people have of
 
04:43:22.110 --> 04:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
different walks of life in the buildings
 
04:43:24.750 --> 04:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately if I gets out building a
 
04:43:26.590 --> 04:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
has five Apartments I make it five
 
04:43:29.190 --> 04:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
Venture voucher holders and I want to
 
04:43:30.550 --> 04:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
say no to some of them I don't want to
 
04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
have that many voucher holders in one
 
04:43:35.910 --> 04:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
spot because I've had it happen once and
 
04:43:38.150 --> 04:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
it it became problematic I don't want to
 
04:43:39.590 --> 04:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
go into details because it's not fail of
 
04:43:42.310 --> 04:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
the tenants so I'm am asking you to
 
04:43:44.310 --> 04:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
think through this bill look at either
 
04:43:47.430 --> 04:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
reforming it or not passing it thank you
 
04:43:49.550 --> 04:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
 
04:43:51.788 --> 04:43:51.798 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:43:56.110 --> 04:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question when you say that
 
04:43:58.550 --> 04:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
removing or forcing you to accept
 
04:44:01.670 --> 04:44:01.680 align:start position:0%

fits in and who might be a problem and
 
04:44:15.110 --> 04:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
the specific comment you were
 
04:44:16.868 --> 04:44:16.878 align:start position:0%
referencing was when we were saying that
 
04:44:18.550 --> 04:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
this could be a tool for discriminating
 
04:44:20.948 --> 04:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
against discriminating against protected
 
04:44:22.868 --> 04:44:22.878 align:start position:0%

Manchester um the bill before you today
 
04:45:19.788 --> 04:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
attempts to accomplish one very simple
 
04:45:21.910 --> 04:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
thing to prevent corporations from
 
04:45:23.430 --> 04:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
outbidding families who are trying to
 
04:45:24.550 --> 04:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
purchase a
 
04:45:27.430 --> 04:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
home I'll start by sharing my personal
 
04:45:29.708 --> 04:45:29.718 align:start position:0%
experience with this problem a few years
 
04:45:31.510 --> 04:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
ago my husband and I were told by our
 
04:45:33.190 --> 04:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
landlord that he would be renovating our
 
04:45:35.470 --> 04:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
apartment and that we needed to move out
 
04:45:37.868 --> 04:45:37.878 align:start position:0%
back when this was happening in 2021 and
 
04:45:39.910 --> 04:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
still to this day rents and Manchester
 
04:45:41.868 --> 04:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
are the same or more than the average
 
04:45:44.190 --> 04:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
mortgage so we decided to take the leap
 
04:45:45.868 --> 04:45:45.878 align:start position:0%
and look for a home in the city that we
 
04:45:47.910 --> 04:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
had always lived in together and we
 
04:45:49.470 --> 04:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
nearly ended up houseless because of
 
04:45:51.670 --> 04:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
that decision over the next two months
 
04:45:53.350 --> 04:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
we viewed a number of homes even
 
04:45:55.110 --> 04:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
venturing outside of Manchester which is
 
04:45:57.708 --> 04:45:57.718 align:start position:0%
where we wanted to stay until the last
 
04:46:00.110 --> 04:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
offer we made every single offer we made
 
04:46:02.270 --> 04:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
we were outbid on not by other young
 
04:46:04.990 --> 04:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
families but by corporations these
 
04:46:07.110 --> 04:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
mostly out ofate groups would come in
 
04:46:08.510 --> 04:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
often without even looking at the
 
04:46:10.670 --> 04:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
property and put forward offers that
 
04:46:12.670 --> 04:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
were irresistible to the owners almost
 
04:46:14.788 --> 04:46:14.798 align:start position:0%
always paying in cash the most
 
04:46:16.788 --> 04:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
devastating home we lost out on the
 
04:46:19.350 --> 04:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
corporation overbid by
 
04:46:21.550 --> 04:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
$150,000 and then proceeded to reach out
 
04:46:23.190 --> 04:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
to my husband and I and ask if we would
 
04:46:25.788 --> 04:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
like to rent the property from them this
 
04:46:27.910 --> 04:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
is not a unique story and this is not
 
04:46:30.470 --> 04:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
only a New Hampshire problem over the
 
04:46:32.830 --> 04:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
last decade the number of investors
 
04:46:34.788 --> 04:46:34.798 align:start position:0%

04:46:38.830 --> 04:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
to 15% each year except for from 2020 to
 
04:46:41.270 --> 04:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
2021 which according to a study by red
 
04:46:44.628 --> 04:46:44.638 align:start position:0%

Georgia this trend accelerated during
 
04:47:59.670 --> 04:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 pandemic when low interest
 
04:48:01.350 --> 04:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
rates and Rising real estate prices

spurred investors to expand their

portfolios by 2022 investors accounted
 
04:48:08.548 --> 04:48:08.558 align:start position:0%
for nearly 30% of sales of single family
 
04:48:11.510 --> 04:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
homes up from an average of 16 % just 3
 
04:48:13.750 --> 04:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
years earlier in some cities
 
04:48:15.628 --> 04:48:15.638 align:start position:0%
institutional investors account for a
 
04:48:18.190 --> 04:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
far higher share of single family

04:48:25.270 --> 04:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
by Matt life hedge funds market share of

the 7.6 million single family rental
 
04:48:30.150 --> 04:48:30.160 align:start position:0%

over the next decade from 5% in 2022 to
 
04:48:35.548 --> 04:48:35.558 align:start position:0%
over 40% by
 
04:48:38.150 --> 04:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
2030 as in my own experience because
 
04:48:40.030 --> 04:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
investors are paying in cash they can
 
04:48:41.990 --> 04:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
often easily beat out firsttime home
 
04:48:44.830 --> 04:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
buyers researchers in Atlanta estimated
 
04:48:46.708 --> 04:48:46.718 align:start position:0%
that the institutional investors robbed
 
04:48:49.310 --> 04:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
potential homeowners of $4 billion in
 
04:48:50.910 --> 04:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
equity by weakening home ownership
 
04:48:53.230 --> 04:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
between 2007 and
 
04:48:55.830 --> 04:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
2016 and on top of this once they buy
 
04:48:57.708 --> 04:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
Homes single family rental companies
 
04:48:59.750 --> 04:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
often prove to be bad landlords because
 
04:49:01.510 --> 04:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
they are corporations that are often out
 
04:49:05.910 --> 04:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
of state a 20 uh 2022 study by federal
 
04:49:07.628 --> 04:49:07.638 align:start position:0%
lawmakers found that the five major
 
04:49:10.270 --> 04:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
rental companies hiked their fees by 40%
 
04:49:12.430 --> 04:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
over three-year period and saw their
 
04:49:14.590 --> 04:49:14.600 align:start position:0%
tenants fall behind and rent in
 
04:49:16.670 --> 04:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
California the state's largest corporate
 
04:49:19.110 --> 04:49:19.120 align:start position:0%

04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
research has also documented that
 
04:49:29.030 --> 04:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
corporate landlords file for more
 
04:49:31.030 --> 04:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
evictions than small-time landlords
 
04:49:32.510 --> 04:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
which can permanently harm tenants

ability to find housing in the
 
04:49:36.628 --> 04:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
future um and I wanted to share that
 
04:49:38.868 --> 04:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
this legislation is not new unique a
 
04:49:40.788 --> 04:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
similar bill was introduced to this body
 
04:49:43.150 --> 04:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
last session and Democrats and the US
 
04:49:44.670 --> 04:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
Senate and the house have sponsored
 
04:49:46.548 --> 04:49:46.558 align:start position:0%
similar legislation on the national

laws uh Republican Governor Greg Abbott
 
04:50:06.670 --> 04:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
actually addressed this recently stating
 
04:50:08.310 --> 04:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
that the corporate large- scale buying
 
04:50:10.030 --> 04:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
of residential homes seems to be
 
04:50:11.590 --> 04:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
distorting the market and making it
 
04:50:13.350 --> 04:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
harder for the average Texan to purchase
 
04:50:15.390 --> 04:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
a home this must be added to the
 
04:50:18.150 --> 04:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
legislative agenda to protect Texas
 
04:50:20.670 --> 04:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
families um so the difference I made
 
04:50:22.628 --> 04:50:22.638 align:start position:0%
majorly in the legislation last time and
 
04:50:24.948 --> 04:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
this time around was adding a 90-day
 
04:50:27.708 --> 04:50:27.718 align:start position:0%
caveat so that a business or Corporation
 
04:50:29.350 --> 04:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
could purchase a home once it's been on
 
04:50:31.230 --> 04:50:31.240 align:start position:0%
the market for 90 days and the idea of
 
04:50:33.628 --> 04:50:33.638 align:start position:0%
that is to give everyday Grant estaters
 
04:50:35.590 --> 04:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
the first dibs and a chance at buying
 
04:50:37.430 --> 04:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
these houses before corporations come in
 
04:50:39.270 --> 04:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
and make offers that the landlord simply
 
04:50:41.788 --> 04:50:41.798 align:start position:0%
or the owner simply cannot refuse views
 
04:50:45.190 --> 04:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
um and yeah with that I'll take any
 
04:50:48.030 --> 04:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
questions representive Reed thank you Mr
 
04:50:49.430 --> 04:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
chair thank you so much for your
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
testimony and for taking my question you
 
04:50:54.910 --> 04:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned um Blackstone which is our
 
04:50:57.390 --> 04:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
nation's largest landlord not at all
 
04:50:59.948 --> 04:50:59.958 align:start position:0%
unique many companies have followed suit
 
04:51:02.548 --> 04:51:02.558 align:start position:0%
are you aware of a memo put out by
 
04:51:04.948 --> 04:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
Blackstone that claimed that their goal
 
04:51:07.628 --> 04:51:07.638 align:start position:0%
was to make this nation a quote nation
 
04:51:07.638 --> 04:51:08.390 align:start position:0%
was to make this nation a quote nation
of

04:51:08.390 --> 04:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:51:10.628 --> 04:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
renters I have not heard that but I'm
 
04:51:10.638 --> 04:51:12.628 align:start position:0%
renters I have not heard that but I'm
not

04:51:12.628 --> 04:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:51:16.830 --> 04:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
surprised other questions seeing none oh
 
04:51:19.948 --> 04:51:19.958 align:start position:0%
I'm Excuse me representative
 
04:51:22.708 --> 04:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
Aaron how is this bill going to be
 
04:51:26.110 --> 04:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
enforced because most of the time when a
 
04:51:28.868 --> 04:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
real estate transaction comes to the
 
04:51:30.750 --> 04:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
attention of government it's at the
 
04:51:33.470 --> 04:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
closing and that would be way too far
 
04:51:36.270 --> 04:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
ahead uh in the
 
04:51:39.270 --> 04:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
process um I believe this bill I mean I
 
04:51:41.230 --> 04:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
think unfortunately would probably be
 
04:51:42.708 --> 04:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
addressed on the later end of the
 
04:51:44.310 --> 04:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
process but I believe it gives the power
 
04:51:46.430 --> 04:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
to the attorney general to enforce this
 
04:51:48.230 --> 04:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
but um I can look more thoroughly at the
 
04:51:49.750 --> 04:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
language I haven't looked at this since
 
04:51:54.430 --> 04:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
drafting um are you are you all set yeah
 
04:51:56.110 --> 04:51:56.120 align:start position:0%
I just would want to know how would it
 
04:51:58.350 --> 04:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
come to the attention of the Attorney
 
04:52:00.350 --> 04:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
General because that would be again
 
04:52:01.708 --> 04:52:01.718 align:start position:0%
after the
 
04:52:04.070 --> 04:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
closing yeah I think it would be in the
 
04:52:05.948 --> 04:52:05.958 align:start position:0%
process but I'll double check and um get
 
04:52:08.350 --> 04:52:08.360 align:start position:0%
back to you so so my question is is
 
04:52:11.470 --> 04:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
regarding the the penalty um
 
04:52:13.510 --> 04:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
line 25 it says the court shall if
 
04:52:15.910 --> 04:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
they're find found in violation the
 
04:52:19.190 --> 04:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
court shall declare the land as cheated
 
04:52:20.590 --> 04:52:20.600 align:start position:0%
which I that's a big word for me I don't
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
know what that necessarily means to the
 
04:52:25.110 --> 04:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
municipality or unincorporated place so
 
04:52:27.470 --> 04:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
the the town or the municipality is now
 
04:52:30.830 --> 04:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:35.230 --> 04:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:38.510 --> 04:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
then they're responsible for upkeep and
 
04:52:43.150 --> 04:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:44.948 --> 04:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
oh I'm looking at the wrong Bill what
 
04:52:46.830 --> 04:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
line are youing I'm looking on on page
 
04:52:48.190 --> 04:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
two line
 
04:52:51.190 --> 04:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
25 the court shall declare shall declare
 
04:52:53.270 --> 04:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
the land as cheed to the
 
04:52:55.390 --> 04:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
municipality and or unincorporated
 
04:52:57.310 --> 04:52:57.320 align:start position:0%
portion of the state the county which is
 
04:52:59.628 --> 04:52:59.638 align:start position:0%
located when the es is decreed the clerk
 
04:53:01.150 --> 04:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
of the court shall notify the governing
 
04:53:03.310 --> 04:53:03.320 align:start position:0%
body the select Board of municipality
 
04:53:04.670 --> 04:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
County that the title and real estate is
 
04:53:07.030 --> 04:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
vested in that subdivision of the state
 
04:53:08.628 --> 04:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
and authorize the subdivision of the
 
04:53:08.638 --> 04:53:11.948 align:start position:0%
and authorize the subdivision of the
state

04:53:11.948 --> 04:53:11.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:15.430 --> 04:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
so to sell the property yeah so you're
 
04:53:15.440 --> 04:53:16.590 align:start position:0%
so to sell the property yeah so you're
talking

04:53:16.590 --> 04:53:16.600 align:start position:0%
talking
 
04:53:20.990 --> 04:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
about towns being in the the property
 
04:53:26.070 --> 04:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:28.708 --> 04:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
ready um the other thing I would be open
 
04:53:31.310 --> 04:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
to um you know not to ask the committee
 
04:53:32.910 --> 04:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
to do work on my behalf but I'd be happy
 
04:53:34.990 --> 04:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
to make any amendments to this bill if
 
04:53:36.670 --> 04:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
um you know there are amendments that
 
04:53:38.070 --> 04:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
could be made to make it more palatable
 
04:53:40.430 --> 04:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
to members I do think this is an issue
 
04:53:42.390 --> 04:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
is that you know crosses party lines
 
04:53:44.110 --> 04:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
I've heard from a lot of my constituents
 
04:53:46.430 --> 04:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
about the issues they've um experienced
 
04:53:49.230 --> 04:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
similar to mine with um buying housing
 
04:53:51.230 --> 04:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
before corporations buy it up you know I
 
04:53:53.910 --> 04:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
thought maybe lowering it from 90 to 30
 
04:53:55.750 --> 04:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
days could be a good compromise but yeah
 
04:53:58.150 --> 04:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
happy to work with Y all thank you
 
04:53:58.160 --> 04:53:59.948 align:start position:0%
happy to work with Y all thank you
representative

04:53:59.948 --> 04:53:59.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:54:02.110 --> 04:54:02.120 align:start position:0%
Dumont how would this affect residents
 
04:54:03.830 --> 04:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
of the state that would wish to purchase
 
04:54:07.110 --> 04:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
real property under an LLC a trust or
 
04:54:08.750 --> 04:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
even a corporation just to protect their
 
04:54:10.670 --> 04:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
own interest not necessarily a company
 
04:54:12.910 --> 04:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
but one that uses those tools to you
 
04:54:14.430 --> 04:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
just pull the the mic a little closer
 
04:54:15.948 --> 04:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
one that uses those tools to protect
 
04:54:18.430 --> 04:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
themselves there are a couple exceptions
 
04:54:20.310 --> 04:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
noted in here or like grandfathered in
 
04:54:22.510 --> 04:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
Clauses but in general they would fall
 
04:54:26.070 --> 04:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
under the same um they would also not be
 
04:54:28.310 --> 04:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
able to purchase property single family
 
04:54:31.030 --> 04:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
housing specifically under an LLC
 
04:54:32.310 --> 04:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's you know one person that's
 
04:54:36.110 --> 04:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
running the corporation or 100
 
04:54:39.628 --> 04:54:39.638 align:start position:0%
yeah okay other questions seeing none
 
04:54:40.868 --> 04:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
thank you represent
 
04:54:49.030 --> 04:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:52.430 --> 04:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
wheeler chair members of the housing
 
04:54:54.788 --> 04:54:54.798 align:start position:0%
committee here in the house uh it's
 
04:54:56.350 --> 04:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
congratulations to you all on being
 
04:54:58.230 --> 04:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
appointed to this very important new
 
04:55:00.788 --> 04:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
committee as all of us here you know
 
04:55:02.990 --> 04:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
this is one of the more important issues
 
04:55:04.628 --> 04:55:04.638 align:start position:0%
that the legislature faces so it's
 
04:55:06.510 --> 04:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
always good when the legislature does
 
04:55:08.070 --> 04:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
its job and makes a committee around
 
04:55:10.628 --> 04:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
that issue so we can actually study it
 
04:55:13.868 --> 04:55:13.878 align:start position:0%
I'm here today not to say that HB 623 is
 
04:55:16.548 --> 04:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
a perfect piece of law or piece of
 
04:55:19.230 --> 04:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
legislation uh but to say that
 
04:55:21.390 --> 04:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
consolidation destroys economies and
 
04:55:22.590 --> 04:55:22.600 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing happening with
 
04:55:24.628 --> 04:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
Blackstone and black rock and State
 
04:55:27.030 --> 04:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
Street and Vanguard where these Wall
 
04:55:30.030 --> 04:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
Street firms not for one political arm
 
04:55:32.788 --> 04:55:32.798 align:start position:0%
or the other or you know one just
 
04:55:35.670 --> 04:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
because they like power and wealth and
 
04:55:37.150 --> 04:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
you get a lot of power and wealth when
 
04:55:40.350 --> 04:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
you own $23 trillion worth of the
 
04:55:42.990 --> 04:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
economy and everything else you know I
 
04:55:44.590 --> 04:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
hear a lot about housing from my
 
04:55:46.868 --> 04:55:46.878 align:start position:0%
constituents the issue of Housing and
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
then I hear from some people in my party
 
04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
and other parties well we should get rid
 
04:55:53.070 --> 04:55:53.080 align:start position:0%
of zoning we should do this we should do
 
04:55:55.868 --> 04:55:55.878 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of issues around
 
04:55:58.390 --> 04:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
housing but you know to me I see the
 
04:56:00.350 --> 04:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
biggest issue with housing is that these
 
04:56:02.750 --> 04:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
major corporations are
 
04:56:05.350 --> 04:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
artificially manufacturing the market
 
04:56:09.430 --> 04:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
and uh Rising prices by buying up these
 
04:56:12.470 --> 04:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
homes in a way that keeps us from having
 
04:56:14.150 --> 04:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
and participating in the market in a
 
04:56:16.190 --> 04:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
real way you know as representative
 
04:56:19.310 --> 04:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
Murray Illustrated
 
04:56:21.708 --> 04:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
when representative Murray tried to buy
 
04:56:25.628 --> 04:56:25.638 align:start position:0%
a house the corporation B came in and
 
04:56:27.430 --> 04:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
bought it before them and then there's a
 
04:56:30.190 --> 04:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of stories about people
 
04:56:31.948 --> 04:56:31.958 align:start position:0%
who've tried to buy a house and then the
 
04:56:33.750 --> 04:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
corporation comes in and buys it before
 
04:56:37.750 --> 04:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
them you know so $23 trillion in assets
 
04:56:39.470 --> 04:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's how much these big Wall Street
 
04:56:41.430 --> 04:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
firms have in their economy everything
 
04:56:42.990 --> 04:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
else I think is a bit of a joke it
 
04:56:44.990 --> 04:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
really doesn't matter what your politics
 
04:56:47.670 --> 04:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
are on this issue uh the world is being
 
04:56:49.830 --> 04:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
bought up by people that want to buy the
 
04:56:53.190 --> 04:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
world and and as they said in their you
 
04:56:55.510 --> 04:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
know conferences and things like that
 
04:56:58.708 --> 04:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
you'll own nothing and you'll be happy
 
04:56:59.990 --> 04:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's the world that they want
 
04:57:02.708 --> 04:57:02.718 align:start position:0%
for us so you know to me the American
 
04:57:05.310 --> 04:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
dream should be the American reality I
 
04:57:07.390 --> 04:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
want to own a home I want to have a
 
04:57:09.670 --> 04:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
piece of land I want to protect my
 
04:57:11.910 --> 04:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
family on that land I want to make sure
 
04:57:13.830 --> 04:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
that the economy works that the market
 
04:57:16.150 --> 04:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
is open for all people it's transparent
 
04:57:19.150 --> 04:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
and honest to me if there's these
 
04:57:21.150 --> 04:57:21.160 align:start position:0%
corporations buying up LLC people say
 
04:57:22.990 --> 04:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
Blackstone but it's really also these
 
04:57:25.430 --> 04:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
fake LLC corporations not what your
 
04:57:26.670 --> 04:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
question was referring to but I look at
 
04:57:28.708 --> 04:57:28.718 align:start position:0%
you because you had brought up the llc's
 
04:57:31.150 --> 04:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
where people they look at oh who bought
 
04:57:33.708 --> 04:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
my house and it was this ghost LLC that
 
04:57:35.470 --> 04:57:35.480 align:start position:0%
if you trace it back and you have to go
 
04:57:37.110 --> 04:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
through 20 different shell companies it
 
04:57:38.788 --> 04:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
ends up at Black Rock State Street
 
04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
Vanguard all three of these same
 
04:57:41.948 --> 04:57:41.958 align:start position:0%
companies and they've got a million
 
04:57:43.990 --> 04:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
different shell companies all across the
 
04:57:46.430 --> 04:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
world all across New Hampshire that are
 
04:57:47.948 --> 04:57:47.958 align:start position:0%
buying up these homes and in different
 
04:57:49.830 --> 04:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
ways and then it's able to say oh well
 
04:57:52.030 --> 04:57:52.040 align:start position:0%
that was that LLC that was this LLC well
 
04:57:53.270 --> 04:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
you know follow the money where does
 
04:57:54.670 --> 04:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
that go and it goes right back to these
 
04:57:58.910 --> 04:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
firms so can we address this issue in a
 
04:58:02.030 --> 04:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
silver bullet kind of way with the New
 
04:58:04.390 --> 04:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature and its power
 
04:58:06.430 --> 04:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
maybe not but I think that we can begin
 
04:58:09.310 --> 04:58:09.320 align:start position:0%
to address the issue by opening up maybe
 
04:58:11.470 --> 04:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
a potential subcommittee on this issue
 
04:58:14.390 --> 04:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
or a study commiss committee but just uh
 
04:58:15.868 --> 04:58:15.878 align:start position:0%
intaking the information that we're
 
04:58:17.628 --> 04:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
hearing across the state about the fact
 
04:58:19.390 --> 04:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
that these corporations are buying up
 
04:58:21.310 --> 04:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
these homes and maybe potentially
 
04:58:24.310 --> 04:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
figuring out some way to make HB 623
 
04:58:26.548 --> 04:58:26.558 align:start position:0%
work for us and our people so that as I
 
04:58:28.708 --> 04:58:28.718 align:start position:0%
said in the beginning the American dream
 
04:58:30.548 --> 04:58:30.558 align:start position:0%
can be the American reality and all of
 
04:58:32.270 --> 04:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
us at one point or another in our lives
 
04:58:35.868 --> 04:58:35.878 align:start position:0%
can own a home and own land and and own
 
04:58:37.708 --> 04:58:37.718 align:start position:0%
and be happy and so we're not a nation
 
04:58:40.430 --> 04:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
of renters so thank you very much Mr
 
04:58:42.190 --> 04:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and again congratulations to
 
04:58:44.070 --> 04:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
your all appointment to this committee
 
04:58:45.670 --> 04:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
and look forward to seeing the work that
 
04:58:47.430 --> 04:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
comes out of here thank you for your
 
04:58:48.708 --> 04:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
testimony questions for represent
 
04:58:51.310 --> 04:58:51.320 align:start position:0%
wheeler represent bullo yes thank you
 
04:58:53.070 --> 04:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
and I I very much sympathize with you
 
04:58:55.350 --> 04:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
know the story and the frustration that
 
04:58:57.150 --> 04:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
happened that brought this legislation
 
04:59:00.750 --> 04:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
forward I just really question um you
 
04:59:03.110 --> 04:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
know really thinking this through about
 
04:59:04.750 --> 04:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
you know just how this mechanism would
 
04:59:06.628 --> 04:59:06.638 align:start position:0%
even begin to work putting aside the
 
04:59:09.070 --> 04:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
Constitutional concerns but when you say
 
04:59:13.830 --> 04:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
non-natural person does that include a
 
04:59:16.670 --> 04:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
nonprofit my testimony was around the
 
04:59:18.990 --> 04:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
issue itself I think as I said in my
 
04:59:20.830 --> 04:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
testimony a subcommittee or a study
 
04:59:23.070 --> 04:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
committee on this issue so we can figure
 
04:59:24.430 --> 04:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
out how it works for the State of New
 
04:59:27.430 --> 04:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is much better than uh coming
 
04:59:29.750 --> 04:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
forward to this committee then uh with a
 
04:59:31.590 --> 04:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
stick in hand and saying this is how
 
04:59:33.510 --> 04:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
that stick's going to hurt I think
 
04:59:35.910 --> 04:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
coming with a carrot and maybe studying
 
04:59:37.948 --> 04:59:37.958 align:start position:0%
the issue and bringing together all the
 
04:59:40.230 --> 04:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
different stakeholders and and conver
 
04:59:41.868 --> 04:59:41.878 align:start position:0%
ation and talking about the issue is a
 
04:59:44.788 --> 04:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
much better way to go about it than
 
04:59:46.788 --> 04:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
debating the minutia of what the
 
04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
drafting agents have have brought
 
04:59:49.830 --> 04:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
forward us
 
04:59:51.910 --> 04:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
today I'm gonna have a study committee
 
04:59:53.190 --> 04:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
of all the people all the Reps that
 
04:59:55.788 --> 04:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
testified in favor of this bill and on
 
04:59:59.390 --> 04:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
it put on Mr chair on have at it tap me
 
05:00:03.270 --> 05:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:06.230 --> 05:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
Dumont thank you chair how often do you
 
05:00:08.190 --> 05:00:08.200 align:start position:0%
see these large corporations doing what
 
05:00:10.430 --> 05:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
you what you are saying buying up uh
 
05:00:12.030 --> 05:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
large amounts of single family property
 
05:00:13.628 --> 05:00:13.638 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire versus
 
05:00:15.708 --> 05:00:15.718 align:start position:0%
residents of the state or possibly
 
05:00:18.310 --> 05:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
residents from another state moving in I
 
05:00:21.150 --> 05:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
don't think we have specific data on
 
05:00:22.670 --> 05:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
what these corporations have done in the
 
05:00:24.510 --> 05:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire but there is data
 
05:00:26.708 --> 05:00:26.718 align:start position:0%
across the country and across the world
 
05:00:29.230 --> 05:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
as to how much these corporations have
 
05:00:30.830 --> 05:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
bought in and I think you could probably
 
05:00:33.030 --> 05:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
average that data out uh in New
 
05:00:34.350 --> 05:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I I don't have that data off
 
05:00:35.590 --> 05:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
the top of my head but what I would say
 
05:00:38.270 --> 05:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
is that over the course of these last
 
05:00:41.190 --> 05:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
especially since um legislation was
 
05:00:43.310 --> 05:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
passed five years ago by the federal
 
05:00:45.150 --> 05:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
Congress to make this a little easier
 
05:00:46.990 --> 05:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
that this has been happening I mean this
 
05:00:48.270 --> 05:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
has been happening for a long time but
 
05:00:50.070 --> 05:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's accelerated a lot over the course
 
05:00:52.150 --> 05:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
of the last five years and I'd be happy
 
05:00:54.470 --> 05:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
to send any information about that
 
05:00:57.270 --> 05:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
nationally yeah thank
 
05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
you representative Reed thank you I'm so
 
05:01:03.628 --> 05:01:03.638 align:start position:0%
glad you quoted the line You'll own
 
05:01:06.070 --> 05:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
nothing and you'll be happy I was
 
05:01:10.110 --> 05:01:10.120 align:start position:0%
thinking that the entire time um so you
 
05:01:12.750 --> 05:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
touched on the idea that there's been
 
05:01:15.070 --> 05:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
reticence around issues like this in
 
05:01:17.990 --> 05:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
terms of solutions to the housing crisis
 
05:01:20.470 --> 05:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the attention has been
 
05:01:24.670 --> 05:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
refocused on zoning um and and and
 
05:01:27.910 --> 05:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
specifically on supply and demand yeah
 
05:01:29.628 --> 05:01:29.638 align:start position:0%
as if that's the only cause to the
 
05:01:32.190 --> 05:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
housing crisis and my question is to you
 
05:01:34.868 --> 05:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
since our demand our our supply of
 
05:01:37.190 --> 05:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
housing is not going up at the rate it
 
05:01:39.310 --> 05:01:39.320 align:start position:0%
should but isn't is not decreasing right
 
05:01:41.190 --> 05:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
the housing the houses are not burning
 
05:01:44.948 --> 05:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
down um has the population of New
 
05:01:47.470 --> 05:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire increased so significantly in
 
05:01:49.390 --> 05:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
The Last 5 Years that it's demanded a
 
05:01:52.948 --> 05:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
triple or quadruple value that we've
 
05:01:55.110 --> 05:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
seen has our population increased that
 
05:01:57.708 --> 05:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
much no absolutely not I mean you know
 
05:01:59.548 --> 05:01:59.558 align:start position:0%
everyone in my town oh I bought my house
 
05:02:01.670 --> 05:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
for $100,000 and then the house down the
 
05:02:03.190 --> 05:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
street just sold for
 
05:02:05.510 --> 05:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
$500,000 I can't believe it and they get
 
05:02:07.110 --> 05:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
very worried and scared so no
 
05:02:08.948 --> 05:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
representative read our population as
 
05:02:10.350 --> 05:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
far as I understand has has been quite
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
stagnant over the last eight years
 
05:02:16.030 --> 05:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
representative taxton uh just to clarify
 
05:02:17.548 --> 05:02:17.558 align:start position:0%
that question the population of New
 
05:02:20.030 --> 05:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has increased by about 30% in
 
05:02:22.548 --> 05:02:22.558 align:start position:0%
the last four years well I'm happy to
 
05:02:24.548 --> 05:02:24.558 align:start position:0%
stand corrected you know the numbers
 
05:02:27.868 --> 05:02:27.878 align:start position:0%
better than I great great um any other
 
05:02:29.350 --> 05:02:29.360 align:start position:0%

represent Hillsboro district 21 um and
 
05:02:52.670 --> 05:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
last time I was here I told you guys a
 
05:02:55.030 --> 05:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
story that was um pretty much pretty
 
05:02:58.270 --> 05:02:58.280 align:start position:0%
relevant to all of this where I knew
 
05:03:01.110 --> 05:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
this was about like maybe a year or so
 
05:03:03.590 --> 05:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
ago it was when or maybe it was closer
 
05:03:05.628 --> 05:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
to like two years ago 22 it was that
 
05:03:08.230 --> 05:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
summer when all the homes were going on
 
05:03:11.190 --> 05:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
the market and then being bought up um
 
05:03:12.670 --> 05:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
and houses were being bought up from
 
05:03:14.590 --> 05:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
right under people and I knew two
 
05:03:16.868 --> 05:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
different couples one was my hairdresser
 
05:03:20.190 --> 05:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
another one actually rented um you know
 
05:03:22.868 --> 05:03:22.878 align:start position:0%
a one of the a duplex in the house
 
05:03:24.708 --> 05:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
across the street from me and they were
 
05:03:27.788 --> 05:03:27.798 align:start position:0%
looking to buy as well and both of them
 
05:03:29.788 --> 05:03:29.798 align:start position:0%
it turns out talking to them at separate
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
times were actually going to the same
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
like few house showings that were
 
05:03:36.390 --> 05:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
happening at the time that summer um
 
05:03:38.110 --> 05:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
before houses were being totally bought
 
05:03:41.190 --> 05:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
up um and they right when they would get
 
05:03:43.910 --> 05:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
to the house o Open House the house
 
05:03:46.030 --> 05:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
would be gone like somebody walked in
 
05:03:48.628 --> 05:03:48.638 align:start position:0%
that morning with $100,000 suit in the
 
05:03:51.190 --> 05:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
suitcase you know and then they can't
 
05:03:53.230 --> 05:03:53.240 align:start position:0%
resist selling it you know me and my
 
05:03:56.910 --> 05:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
husband moved here um back in 2012 when
 
05:03:59.150 --> 05:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
he got a job here and we moved here from
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
Georgia so we moved up here we rented at
 
05:04:04.350 --> 05:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
first over in the hookset area and and
 
05:04:06.030 --> 05:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
when we found out his job was going to
 
05:04:08.070 --> 05:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
work out um we had originally gotten
 
05:04:10.310 --> 05:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
like a year lease and we started looking
 
05:04:13.310 --> 05:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
for homes we were able to have time to
 
05:04:15.948 --> 05:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
look for a home like any one would think
 
05:04:17.830 --> 05:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
any normal couple can do that a lot of
 
05:04:19.750 --> 05:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
y'all might have had the opportunity to
 
05:04:21.788 --> 05:04:21.798 align:start position:0%
do at some point in your life we were
 
05:04:24.150 --> 05:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
able to go house hunting say what we
 
05:04:26.708 --> 05:04:26.718 align:start position:0%
liked what we didn't like have options
 
05:04:29.590 --> 05:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
and then afterwards have time to go have
 
05:04:32.708 --> 05:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
a beer and discuss you know what we saw
 
05:04:36.590 --> 05:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
and if we wanted that um and then we
 
05:04:39.750 --> 05:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
outbid seven other buyers for our home
 
05:04:42.510 --> 05:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
but the original listing was like 239 or
 
05:04:45.070 --> 05:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
something and we bought it for like 249
 
05:04:46.750 --> 05:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
because I just was like let's just bid a
 
05:04:51.350 --> 05:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
little bit over and get it um so anyways
 
05:04:53.868 --> 05:04:53.878 align:start position:0%
now it's worth more than double that and
 
05:04:57.310 --> 05:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
it's really not technically um but it's
 
05:04:59.990 --> 05:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
worth more than double of that and I'm
 
05:05:01.548 --> 05:05:01.558 align:start position:0%
not hearing the stories where people
 
05:05:03.670 --> 05:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
have those same opportunities now with
 
05:05:05.548 --> 05:05:05.558 align:start position:0%
the way things are going so we talk a
 
05:05:07.948 --> 05:05:07.958 align:start position:0%
lot in the legislature about personal
 
05:05:09.948 --> 05:05:09.958 align:start position:0%
property and we talk about having
 
05:05:11.788 --> 05:05:11.798 align:start position:0%
personal property rights and all that
 
05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
stuff and we all know that owning land
 
05:05:17.430 --> 05:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
is power and it does mean it's something
 
05:05:20.590 --> 05:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
of your own but if there's no land left
 
05:05:23.310 --> 05:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
to bought be bought what are we going to
 
05:05:25.788 --> 05:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
do are we really America are we really
 
05:05:27.510 --> 05:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and Live Free
 
05:05:27.520 --> 05:05:28.310 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and Live Free
or

05:05:28.310 --> 05:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:05:31.708 --> 05:05:31.718 align:start position:0%
Die so that's what I have to say thank
 
05:05:33.390 --> 05:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative questions
 
05:05:36.310 --> 05:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you again
 
05:05:40.030 --> 05:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um
 
05:05:42.628 --> 05:05:42.638 align:start position:0%
would you be surprised if I told you
 
05:05:43.868 --> 05:05:43.878 align:start position:0%
that according to the New Hampshire
 
05:05:47.030 --> 05:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal policy Institute that since 2020
 
05:05:49.628 --> 05:05:49.638 align:start position:0%
the the year to end all years um New
 
05:05:51.830 --> 05:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population has grown by
 
05:05:55.190 --> 05:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
1.8% and the fastest growing County
 
05:05:58.670 --> 05:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
Carol County was 4.7% would you be
 
05:06:00.230 --> 05:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
surprised that information and do you
 
05:06:03.350 --> 05:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
think that even 4.7% increase in
 
05:06:06.788 --> 05:06:06.798 align:start position:0%
population would justify without the
 
05:06:08.470 --> 05:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
interference of these businesses that
 
05:06:11.270 --> 05:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
are trying to drive up the market would
 
05:06:15.670 --> 05:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
only 4.7% or 1.8% Justify the triple and
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
quadrupling of values no I also think
 
05:06:22.350 --> 05:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
that it's very telling about this
 
05:06:24.470 --> 05:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
happening Nationwide and coinciding with
 
05:06:26.230 --> 05:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of what has been discussed here
 
05:06:28.510 --> 05:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
today I feel like that's not a
 
05:06:31.470 --> 05:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
coincidence thank you other questions
 
05:06:32.990 --> 05:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
seean thank you
 
05:06:35.190 --> 05:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative um Grace Murray I don't
 
05:06:37.150 --> 05:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
think she's here okay that's no not a
 
05:06:42.548 --> 05:06:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:44.430 --> 05:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh once again for an
 
05:06:46.548 --> 05:06:46.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak for the housing
 
05:06:49.310 --> 05:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
committee uh on this one my testimony
 
05:06:52.510 --> 05:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
will be much shorter than on on others
 
05:06:55.150 --> 05:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
the the basic problem here is the the
 
05:06:59.470 --> 05:06:59.480 align:start position:0%
way the bill is crafted it's just
 
05:07:02.230 --> 05:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and it does refer to
 
05:07:04.910 --> 05:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
all legal entities so the title is
 
05:07:07.390 --> 05:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
misleading it's not corporations that
 
05:07:10.510 --> 05:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
are targeted by this
 
05:07:13.030 --> 05:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
um it would certainly Squatch the
 
05:07:15.230 --> 05:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
creation of Workforce housing which
 
05:07:17.830 --> 05:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
would be a shame in our Market it'll
 
05:07:19.708 --> 05:07:19.718 align:start position:0%
push developers away from investing in
 
05:07:21.628 --> 05:07:21.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we need to focus on
 
05:07:23.548 --> 05:07:23.558 align:start position:0%
creating more housing not implementing
 
05:07:25.510 --> 05:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
laws that reduce the construction of
 
05:07:28.868 --> 05:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
housing let's talk about uh
 
05:07:31.390 --> 05:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionality to have a property a
 
05:07:36.150 --> 05:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
cheet back to the governing body County
 
05:07:38.350 --> 05:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
or state or however it's written would
 
05:07:41.788 --> 05:07:41.798 align:start position:0%
be a uh taking without just compensation
 
05:07:43.948 --> 05:07:43.958 align:start position:0%
and a cheet does mean that the property
 
05:07:47.548 --> 05:07:47.558 align:start position:0%
is given back to
 
05:07:50.070 --> 05:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh in this case the
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
government um corporations and legal
 
05:07:58.788 --> 05:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
entities for I presumably uh I don't
 
05:08:02.150 --> 05:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
know 200 years supposedly have been
 
05:08:05.590 --> 05:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
afforded constitutional protections that
 
05:08:08.390 --> 05:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
entities Is Not A New Concept at all
 
05:08:11.430 --> 05:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
entities are protected by the
 
05:08:15.110 --> 05:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution and can transact
 
05:08:19.270 --> 05:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
business the bill refers to non-natural
 
05:08:21.590 --> 05:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
person that would mean all forms of
 
05:08:24.548 --> 05:08:24.558 align:start position:0%
legal entities would be excluded
 
05:08:28.070 --> 05:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
corporations trusts General Partnerships
 
05:08:29.948 --> 05:08:29.958 align:start position:0%
limited Partnerships
 
05:08:33.190 --> 05:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
llc's any form of entity including uh
 
05:08:33.200 --> 05:08:36.990 align:start position:0%
llc's any form of entity including uh
nonprofit

05:08:36.990 --> 05:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:41.350 --> 05:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
entity certainly it would disincentivize
 
05:08:45.030 --> 05:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
developers from building housing which
 
05:08:47.070 --> 05:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
has all these restrictions they could
 
05:08:48.110 --> 05:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
just build
 
05:08:50.628 --> 05:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
Condominiums which would not have these
 
05:08:52.628 --> 05:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
restrictions and that's just going to be
 
05:08:57.868 --> 05:08:57.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:00.788 --> 05:09:00.798 align:start position:0%
housing when you are looking at the cost
 
05:09:03.830 --> 05:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
of developing housing it takes a lot of
 
05:09:06.590 --> 05:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
money we've this no news right
 
05:09:07.990 --> 05:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
everybody's saying it just doesn't
 
05:09:11.270 --> 05:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
pencil out it takes lot of Revenue to
 
05:09:14.750 --> 05:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
pull together enough resources to create
 
05:09:17.270 --> 05:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
a development or to create housing and
 
05:09:20.948 --> 05:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
so you need to have legal entities that
 
05:09:23.310 --> 05:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
can pull together multiple people's
 
05:09:25.750 --> 05:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
monies that they can come in and create
 
05:09:27.910 --> 05:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
a development of new
 
05:09:31.948 --> 05:09:31.958 align:start position:0%
housing so um I'd be happy to answer any
 
05:09:34.110 --> 05:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Norman
 
05:09:36.830 --> 05:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you again Mr
 
05:09:39.670 --> 05:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you again Mr Norman um I
 
05:09:42.548 --> 05:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
believe you said that the process I mean
 
05:09:45.590 --> 05:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
you you raised a number of concerns and
 
05:09:47.390 --> 05:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether we want to say all
 
05:09:50.430 --> 05:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
nonprofits or are all non uh natural
 
05:09:52.628 --> 05:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
entities or just corporations or what
 
05:09:54.788 --> 05:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
have you um and I've heard the word
 
05:09:57.310 --> 05:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional quite a few times and I
 
05:09:59.270 --> 05:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
haven't heard any article or Amendment
 
05:10:01.948 --> 05:10:01.958 align:start position:0%
cited with that so specifically you said
 
05:10:03.590 --> 05:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things you said was
 
05:10:06.350 --> 05:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um and I would love to
 
05:10:08.510 --> 05:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
hear what you're basing it on is the
 
05:10:11.430 --> 05:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
idea of this cheating back to the town
 
05:10:13.350 --> 05:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm curious why you think that's
 
05:10:15.628 --> 05:10:15.638 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional when in fact don't
 
05:10:17.510 --> 05:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
towns take ownership of properties for
 
05:10:20.628 --> 05:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
example when there's a tax lean and the
 
05:10:22.510 --> 05:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
owner hasn't paid their taxes on the
 
05:10:24.390 --> 05:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
property and then the town goes through
 
05:10:26.628 --> 05:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
a process takes over that property and
 
05:10:28.390 --> 05:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
then sells the property to get their tax
 
05:10:30.830 --> 05:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
money back is that also
 
05:10:33.470 --> 05:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so there's in eminent
 
05:10:36.830 --> 05:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
domain the property the owner would have
 
05:10:39.270 --> 05:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
to be compensated have just compens
 
05:10:41.628 --> 05:10:41.638 align:start position:0%
compens ation I don't know if this bill
 
05:10:43.510 --> 05:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
actually gives just
 
05:10:46.788 --> 05:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
compensation and i' have to study that a
 
05:10:49.190 --> 05:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
little bit more okay
 
05:10:52.510 --> 05:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
I follow up are you aware that imminent
 
05:10:54.788 --> 05:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
domain is an entirely distinct and
 
05:10:58.510 --> 05:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
separate process from either leans or S
 
05:11:01.390 --> 05:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
cheating those are different things so
 
05:11:02.868 --> 05:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
you asked
 
05:11:02.878 --> 05:11:05.830 align:start position:0%
you asked
about

05:11:05.830 --> 05:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:11:09.470 --> 05:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionality so in the realm of
 
05:11:11.230 --> 05:11:11.240 align:start position:0%
constitutionality it would be
 
05:11:13.390 --> 05:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional for a government body
 
05:11:17.190 --> 05:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
to take someone's property without just
 
05:11:19.350 --> 05:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
compensation emminent domain is an
 
05:11:22.990 --> 05:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
example of where just compensation is
 
05:11:25.270 --> 05:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
given the other thing that would make
 
05:11:27.350 --> 05:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
this unconstitutional is that
 
05:11:31.670 --> 05:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
corporations have been afforded the
 
05:11:35.190 --> 05:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
abilities to transact
 
05:11:37.350 --> 05:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
business this would take away their
 
05:11:41.190 --> 05:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
ability to transact business
 
05:11:43.470 --> 05:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
okay other questions seeing none thank
 
05:11:57.750 --> 05:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:00.670 --> 05:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
bacon good afternoon everyone again I'm
 
05:12:02.510 --> 05:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
Matt bacon realtor uh and I'm here
 
05:12:04.230 --> 05:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
05:12:05.830 --> 05:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors public policy
 
05:12:07.390 --> 05:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
committee uh and the commercial
 
05:12:08.548 --> 05:12:08.558 align:start position:0%
investment board of realtors public
 
05:12:09.788 --> 05:12:09.798 align:start position:0%
policy committee
 
05:12:12.190 --> 05:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
um NH would urge you to vote in
 
05:12:15.030 --> 05:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on House Bill 623
 
05:12:16.948 --> 05:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
uh first the bill prohibits non-natural
 
05:12:18.590 --> 05:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
people from purchasing single family
 
05:12:20.350 --> 05:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
residents until the property has been on
 
05:12:23.070 --> 05:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
the market for 90 days um families and
 
05:12:25.030 --> 05:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
individuals frequently purchase homes
 
05:12:28.230 --> 05:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
using liabil limited liability companies
 
05:12:31.150 --> 05:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
Estates um trusts many different types
 
05:12:33.708 --> 05:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
of uh ownership that um come through
 
05:12:38.110 --> 05:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
their families um and often um this ban
 
05:12:39.670 --> 05:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
actually artificially
 
05:12:41.910 --> 05:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh inflates pricing for them in the long
 
05:12:44.628 --> 05:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
run they may do this for estate planning
 
05:12:46.510 --> 05:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
privacy reasons protect themselves from
 
05:12:48.750 --> 05:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
liability uh for the tax benefits
 
05:12:51.070 --> 05:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
associated with it uh to operate an
 
05:12:53.070 --> 05:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
inhome business where they finally are
 
05:12:55.070 --> 05:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
getting to have a dream home uh for
 
05:12:58.788 --> 05:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
their work um and in today's market
 
05:13:00.230 --> 05:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
prohibiting someone from purchasing a
 
05:13:01.990 --> 05:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
single family home for 90 days is
 
05:13:04.230 --> 05:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
basically a ban on ownership of it the
 
05:13:05.670 --> 05:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
average time for a single family home to
 
05:13:08.350 --> 05:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
sell in New Hampshire is 28 days uh
 
05:13:10.670 --> 05:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
likewise prohibiting an LLC Corporation
 
05:13:12.510 --> 05:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
from buying a multif family residence
 
05:13:14.110 --> 05:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
for 90 days and then allowing that
 
05:13:15.590 --> 05:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
Corporation to only own that property
 
05:13:17.470 --> 05:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
for 2 years would be one of the most
 
05:13:18.868 --> 05:13:18.878 align:start position:0%
devastating things this legislature
 
05:13:20.110 --> 05:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
could do to the availability and
 
05:13:22.310 --> 05:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
affordability of rental units it is also
 
05:13:26.230 --> 05:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
misleading to title this bill um text as
 
05:13:28.110 --> 05:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
uh prohibition on the purchase of single
 
05:13:29.830 --> 05:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
family homes given that the text of the
 
05:13:33.190 --> 05:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
bill specifically says or multif family
 
05:13:35.628 --> 05:13:35.638 align:start position:0%
following that and does not isolate that
 
05:13:37.190 --> 05:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
down to restricted multif family
 
05:13:39.230 --> 05:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
property or otherwise qualify that
 
05:13:42.190 --> 05:13:42.200 align:start position:0%
language in any way again the details of
 
05:13:43.390 --> 05:13:43.400 align:start position:0%
the bill would basically ban
 
05:13:45.150 --> 05:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
corporations from owning multif family
 
05:13:47.310 --> 05:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
residences and require only individuals
 
05:13:49.590 --> 05:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
to own such properties without liability
 
05:13:51.350 --> 05:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
protection without tax benefit and
 
05:13:52.868 --> 05:13:52.878 align:start position:0%
without the structure that most of our
 
05:13:54.350 --> 05:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
commercial real estate is built on in
 
05:13:54.360 --> 05:13:55.750 align:start position:0%
commercial real estate is built on in
the

05:13:55.750 --> 05:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:13:57.910 --> 05:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
state virtually all multifamilies are
 
05:13:59.190 --> 05:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
currently owned and developed by some
 
05:14:00.708 --> 05:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
type of Corporation many of these
 
05:14:02.230 --> 05:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
properties are worth millions of dollars
 
05:14:03.628 --> 05:14:03.638 align:start position:0%
and under this bill could only be
 
05:14:05.310 --> 05:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
purchased and held by an individual not
 
05:14:07.030 --> 05:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
an LLC or other cor corporate
 
05:14:09.030 --> 05:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
Arrangement during the first 90 days
 
05:14:10.350 --> 05:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
eliminating that incentive for a
 
05:14:12.030 --> 05:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
developer to build or operate a multif
 
05:14:13.670 --> 05:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
family will have the exact opposite
 
05:14:15.270 --> 05:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
impact on the availability and
 
05:14:17.510 --> 05:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
affordability of housing it will
 
05:14:21.230 --> 05:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
additionally prevent most operators from
 
05:14:23.750 --> 05:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
ever acquiring or getting pricing that
 
05:14:25.590 --> 05:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
will allow them to make the construction
 
05:14:27.070 --> 05:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
cost in today's rising cost and
 
05:14:28.628 --> 05:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
inflationary Market
 
05:14:30.590 --> 05:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
possible finally the National
 
05:14:31.990 --> 05:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors conducted a
 
05:14:33.670 --> 05:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
report on institutional buyers of homes
 
05:14:35.470 --> 05:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
and found that New Hampshire was 49th in
 
05:14:37.310 --> 05:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
the percentage of such buyers only
 
05:14:39.030 --> 05:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
Vermont had a smaller percentage again
 
05:14:40.470 --> 05:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
again the so-called institutional
 
05:14:42.868 --> 05:14:42.878 align:start position:0%
investors were almost exclusively
 
05:14:45.190 --> 05:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
llc's not any of these larger
 
05:14:47.150 --> 05:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
institutional investors large
 
05:14:48.350 --> 05:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
institutional investors seek
 
05:14:49.708 --> 05:14:49.718 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged neighborhoods where
 
05:14:51.470 --> 05:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
properties are relatively inexpensive or
 
05:14:53.990 --> 05:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
land is inexpensive places like Arizona
 
05:14:57.110 --> 05:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
Texas Georgia Alabama
 
05:14:59.548 --> 05:14:59.558 align:start position:0%
Etc they buy these they fix them up and
 
05:15:01.110 --> 05:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
rent them or sell them at higher rates
 
05:15:03.150 --> 05:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
or build them where construction cost
 
05:15:04.948 --> 05:15:04.958 align:start position:0%
and infrastructure costs are lower New
 
05:15:06.628 --> 05:15:06.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's High home and rental costs
 
05:15:08.470 --> 05:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
and land costs as well as infrastructure
 
05:15:10.430 --> 05:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
expansion costs make this prohibitive
 
05:15:11.628 --> 05:15:11.638 align:start position:0%
and it means there are very few
 
05:15:12.670 --> 05:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities for one of these
 
05:15:14.548 --> 05:15:14.558 align:start position:0%
institutional investors to find a deal
 
05:15:16.868 --> 05:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
and make it work I'd ask the bill
 
05:15:18.548 --> 05:15:18.558 align:start position:0%
sponsor how many homes in New Hampshire
 
05:15:20.548 --> 05:15:20.558 align:start position:0%
been purchased by Blackstone Blackstone
 
05:15:22.110 --> 05:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
is the nation's largest landlord and
 
05:15:23.670 --> 05:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
according to John Burns real estate
 
05:15:25.390 --> 05:15:25.400 align:start position:0%
Consulting in a published report in
 
05:15:28.910 --> 05:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
August 2024 Blackstone owns only
 
05:15:32.230 --> 05:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
.6% of single family homes in the entire
 
05:15:34.830 --> 05:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
us while all institutions collectively
 
05:15:37.510 --> 05:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
only own one half of a percent no one
 
05:15:39.150 --> 05:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
has testified as to how many homes in
 
05:15:41.510 --> 05:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have been included in this
 
05:15:43.750 --> 05:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
number in fact most institution
 
05:15:45.350 --> 05:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
investors are looking at the areas that
 
05:15:47.590 --> 05:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
I spoke of before and that investor
 
05:15:50.150 --> 05:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
ownership has actually decreased by 8%
 
05:15:52.590 --> 05:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
from 7 years ago according to Census
 
05:15:55.910 --> 05:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
Data under Supply is truly the cause we
 
05:15:57.910 --> 05:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
are a nationwide shortfall of
 
05:16:00.190 --> 05:16:00.200 align:start position:0%
approximately 5 million housing units
 
05:16:01.910 --> 05:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 years according to that
 
05:16:04.628 --> 05:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
same US Census Data while completing
 
05:16:06.190 --> 05:16:06.200 align:start position:0%
fewer homes than before the great
 
05:16:08.150 --> 05:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
financial crisis this is greatly
 
05:16:10.548 --> 05:16:10.558 align:start position:0%
inflated cost and our US Census Data
 
05:16:12.750 --> 05:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
shows demand for approximately 16,
 
05:16:15.788 --> 05:16:15.798 align:start position:0%
900,000 homes in the last decade while
 
05:16:19.110 --> 05:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
delivering just under 12 million a 71%
 
05:16:21.510 --> 05:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
delivery on Supply if that was our food
 
05:16:23.548 --> 05:16:23.558 align:start position:0%
or gas supply it would similarly Spike
 
05:16:25.390 --> 05:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
pricing due to the imbalance of supply
 
05:16:26.948 --> 05:16:26.958 align:start position:0%
and demand and create an inflationary
 
05:16:28.670 --> 05:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
environment just like we've seen in our
 
05:16:28.680 --> 05:16:30.910 align:start position:0%
environment just like we've seen in our
housing

05:16:30.910 --> 05:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
housing
 
05:16:33.548 --> 05:16:33.558 align:start position:0%
market interestingly the half a percent
 
05:16:35.670 --> 05:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
of homes owned by institutions
 
05:16:37.868 --> 05:16:37.878 align:start position:0%
Nationwide is insignificant at a
 
05:16:39.948 --> 05:16:39.958 align:start position:0%
national level compared to to a 29%
 
05:16:41.670 --> 05:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
shortfall in New Hampshire it's a
 
05:16:43.150 --> 05:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
substantially lower percentage and we
 
05:16:45.310 --> 05:16:45.320 align:start position:0%
have not yet heard a single data point
 
05:16:46.628 --> 05:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
showing how many homes have been
 
05:16:48.270 --> 05:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
allegedly purchased by Blackstone or
 
05:16:50.030 --> 05:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
another institution in New Hampshire and
 
05:16:53.390 --> 05:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
created any pressure so I would ask the
 
05:16:55.470 --> 05:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
committee to please vote itl on House
 
05:16:57.628 --> 05:16:57.638 align:start position:0%
Bill 623 thank you for your testimony
 
05:17:00.708 --> 05:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
any questions representative
 
05:17:03.350 --> 05:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:17:04.390 --> 05:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question you're with the
 
05:17:07.628 --> 05:17:07.638 align:start position:0%
realtors association yes okay thank you
 
05:17:11.390 --> 05:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
um followup follow up Mr chair go ahead
 
05:17:12.670 --> 05:17:12.680 align:start position:0%
I was just
 
05:17:15.390 --> 05:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
clarifying because we've heard testimony
 
05:17:18.788 --> 05:17:18.798 align:start position:0%
around the idea that corporations um and
 
05:17:23.230 --> 05:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
other investment firms what have you are
 
05:17:24.830 --> 05:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
aggressively going into the market and
 
05:17:28.150 --> 05:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
spending over uh Market or making offers
 
05:17:30.470 --> 05:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
over market price would wouldn't
 
05:17:32.350 --> 05:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
Realtors stand to game financially for
 
05:17:34.150 --> 05:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
corporations being in that market and
 
05:17:34.160 --> 05:17:35.708 align:start position:0%
corporations being in that market and
buying

05:17:35.708 --> 05:17:35.718 align:start position:0%
buying
 
05:17:38.350 --> 05:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
property um I'm not sure that I'm
 
05:17:40.590 --> 05:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
qualified to answer that question except
 
05:17:44.230 --> 05:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
that to say it's actually decreasing the
 
05:17:48.590 --> 05:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
transaction volume for realtors um in uh
 
05:17:51.868 --> 05:17:51.878 align:start position:0%
2017 approximately 177,000 homes were
 
05:17:53.628 --> 05:17:53.638 align:start position:0%
transacted in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:17:56.350 --> 05:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
in 2024 it was a little over 12,000
 
05:17:59.430 --> 05:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
leading to a lower transition of uh
 
05:18:03.030 --> 05:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
total sales volume um not helping the
 
05:18:06.548 --> 05:18:06.558 align:start position:0%
cause again under Supply uh would Aid of
 
05:18:08.350 --> 05:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
course in your case of uh your question
 
05:18:08.360 --> 05:18:09.310 align:start position:0%
course in your case of uh your question
here

05:18:09.310 --> 05:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:18:12.470 --> 05:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
um realtor transaction volume um but
 
05:18:14.430 --> 05:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
more importantly to our citizens it
 
05:18:16.030 --> 05:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
would increase the affordable housing
 
05:18:19.150 --> 05:18:19.160 align:start position:0%
stock and this bill uh does not in any
 
05:18:21.628 --> 05:18:21.638 align:start position:0%
way address what I believe the question
 
05:18:25.110 --> 05:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
you asked were getting at okay thank you
 
05:18:29.030 --> 05:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:31.708 --> 05:18:31.718 align:start position:0%
testimony and um last up to testify is
 
05:18:31.718 --> 05:18:32.670 align:start position:0%
testimony and um last up to testify is
Chris

05:18:32.670 --> 05:18:32.680 align:start position:0%
Chris
 
05:18:34.750 --> 05:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
Freeman and Chris I know you handed in
 
05:18:36.708 --> 05:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
pink card for 628 we already passed that
 
05:18:39.230 --> 05:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
public hearing I might have handed you
 
05:18:41.150 --> 05:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
mixed up the numbers but yeah 623 we
 
05:18:43.030 --> 05:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
have that yeah agre um I'll keep this
 
05:18:44.590 --> 05:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
pretty short that's a pretty tough act
 
05:18:46.788 --> 05:18:46.798 align:start position:0%
to follow lots of uh very interesting
 
05:18:48.788 --> 05:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
data points in that um so one of the
 
05:18:50.670 --> 05:18:50.680 align:start position:0%
things that I'm not hearing mentioned in
 
05:18:52.350 --> 05:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
any of the conversations that have
 
05:18:55.548 --> 05:18:55.558 align:start position:0%
happened so far um is the impact to
 
05:18:58.190 --> 05:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
sellers uh when they're able to command
 
05:18:59.910 --> 05:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
higher prices because they have an
 
05:19:03.110 --> 05:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
investor buyer um one of the things uh
 
05:19:05.230 --> 05:19:05.240 align:start position:0%
that was really kind of struck me when I
 
05:19:07.470 --> 05:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
first uh began getting into personal
 
05:19:09.948 --> 05:19:09.958 align:start position:0%
finance and Investments was was in in
 
05:19:11.750 --> 05:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
looking to set my own goals and targets
 
05:19:14.430 --> 05:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
I looked at what what is the median uh
 
05:19:16.070 --> 05:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
retirement savings for an actually
 
05:19:17.590 --> 05:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
retired person like what's the the
 
05:19:19.470 --> 05:19:19.480 align:start position:0%
number that you should be shooting for
 
05:19:21.230 --> 05:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
and this number is probably about 5
 
05:19:23.548 --> 05:19:23.558 align:start position:0%
years old now but uh at the time the the
 
05:19:26.310 --> 05:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
median retirement savings were about
 
05:19:28.390 --> 05:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
$167,000 which is not enough to retire
 
05:19:31.910 --> 05:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
on and in digging into uh where that
 
05:19:33.830 --> 05:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
that value was sitting it turned out
 
05:19:36.430 --> 05:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
that uh almost all of that was people's
 
05:19:38.948 --> 05:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
equity in their primary residences they
 
05:19:40.470 --> 05:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
didn't actually have any retirement
 
05:19:42.910 --> 05:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
savings and so for people who are
 
05:19:45.030 --> 05:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
approaching retirement who have not
 
05:19:47.190 --> 05:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
adequately prepared for retirement uh
 
05:19:48.948 --> 05:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
their ability to sell their home in
 
05:19:51.868 --> 05:19:51.878 align:start position:0%
downsize uh is a a key component of
 
05:19:53.788 --> 05:19:53.798 align:start position:0%
their financial solvency in their old
 
05:19:56.708 --> 05:19:56.718 align:start position:0%
age uh and so I I'm would be concerned
 
05:19:59.628 --> 05:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
about any proposal that would seek to uh
 
05:20:01.788 --> 05:20:01.798 align:start position:0%
prevent sellers especially elderly
 
05:20:04.548 --> 05:20:04.558 align:start position:0%
Sellers from being able to get whatever
 
05:20:06.548 --> 05:20:06.558 align:start position:0%
the market determines their home is
 
05:20:09.350 --> 05:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
worth um in addition I think we've
 
05:20:10.628 --> 05:20:10.638 align:start position:0%
already addressed the fact that you know
 
05:20:12.910 --> 05:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
Black Rock ownership is um is relatively
 
05:20:14.030 --> 05:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
small and sure there's going to be some
 
05:20:16.788 --> 05:20:16.798 align:start position:0%
anecdotes on um you know somebody losing
 
05:20:22.270 --> 05:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
out on a deal to an investor um but
 
05:20:24.990 --> 05:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
uh I I've heard several people in their
 
05:20:27.510 --> 05:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
testimonies and their questions ask well
 
05:20:29.990 --> 05:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
what has the population done in New
 
05:20:32.868 --> 05:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has it gone up has it doubled
 
05:20:35.190 --> 05:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
has it gone up by 30% what's what's
 
05:20:38.628 --> 05:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
ultimately driving the prices and I have
 
05:20:40.548 --> 05:20:40.558 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard anybody mention the fact
 
05:20:42.230 --> 05:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
that during the covid pandemic the
 
05:20:44.070 --> 05:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve dumped nearly $8
 
05:20:46.470 --> 05:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
trillion doll worth of new money supply
 
05:20:49.670 --> 05:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
onto the global economy and I don't see
 
05:20:52.110 --> 05:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
any acknowledgement of the fact that the
 
05:20:55.590 --> 05:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
US dollar is fundamentally a commodity
 
05:20:56.990 --> 05:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
and that the value of all other
 
05:21:00.390 --> 05:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
Commodities is denoted in relative terms
 
05:21:02.310 --> 05:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
so when we have a 40% increase in the
 
05:21:05.470 --> 05:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
money supply we should anticipate that
 
05:21:07.190 --> 05:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
the prices of all other Commodities will
 
05:21:09.868 --> 05:21:09.878 align:start position:0%
increase by at least Le that much if not
 
05:21:12.350 --> 05:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
more due to issues with the elasticity
 
05:21:15.030 --> 05:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
or in elasticity as the case may be and
 
05:21:17.830 --> 05:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
real estate of the supply and I think we
 
05:21:19.628 --> 05:21:19.638 align:start position:0%
need to acknowledge that there is
 
05:21:21.310 --> 05:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
nothing no idea that anybody in this
 
05:21:25.310 --> 05:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
room can come up with has any bearing on
 
05:21:27.948 --> 05:21:27.958 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen to the supply of
 
05:21:30.628 --> 05:21:30.638 align:start position:0%
the US dollar now or in the future the
 
05:21:33.350 --> 05:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
only thing that this body can do is
 
05:21:35.270 --> 05:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
clear the way for the creation of new
 
05:21:37.548 --> 05:21:37.558 align:start position:0%
money supply and if we focus on any
 
05:21:39.230 --> 05:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
other solution we're going to be missing
 
05:21:42.070 --> 05:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
the mark that's all I have to say thank
 
05:21:45.390 --> 05:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
you any questions representative Hicks
 
05:21:46.670 --> 05:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I should have
 
05:21:48.350 --> 05:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
asked this for somebody else but I just
 
05:21:51.310 --> 05:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
waited would you consider a non-natural
 
05:21:53.470 --> 05:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
a trust to be a non-natural person when
 
05:21:55.270 --> 05:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
I read the bill for the first time I had
 
05:21:57.470 --> 05:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
that question and I was curious um I was
 
05:21:59.230 --> 05:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
thinking of specifically there's a
 
05:22:00.628 --> 05:22:00.638 align:start position:0%
restaurant that we like to go to where
 
05:22:02.708 --> 05:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
the owners have a disabled child and I
 
05:22:03.948 --> 05:22:03.958 align:start position:0%
know that they were interested in
 
05:22:05.430 --> 05:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
putting the property into trust to
 
05:22:06.948 --> 05:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
benefit their disabled child in the
 
05:22:08.350 --> 05:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
future I did have the question about
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
what whether that would compromise their
 
05:22:12.628 --> 05:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
ability to do so follow up Mr chair um
 
05:22:15.110 --> 05:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
yeah to follow up on that so if a family
 
05:22:17.868 --> 05:22:17.878 align:start position:0%
had a their single family home in a
 
05:22:20.750 --> 05:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
trust to avoid probate typically is why
 
05:22:23.390 --> 05:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
they might do that right um should they
 
05:22:25.150 --> 05:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
you know pass away or
 
05:22:28.190 --> 05:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
whatever would they not be able to
 
05:22:30.230 --> 05:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
purchase a single another single family
 
05:22:30.240 --> 05:22:31.910 align:start position:0%
purchase a single another single family
home

05:22:31.910 --> 05:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
home
 
05:22:34.350 --> 05:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
because they had a trust that trust
 
05:22:36.510 --> 05:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
could not so they would have to purchase
 
05:22:40.430 --> 05:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
it as a as a couple as a single person
 
05:22:42.270 --> 05:22:42.280 align:start position:0%
and then reestablish a trust do you have
 
05:22:45.270 --> 05:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
any idea uh I'm I'm not an attorney but
 
05:22:48.430 --> 05:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
my belief is that if it was a revocable
 
05:22:50.070 --> 05:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
trust they might be able to move the
 
05:22:51.868 --> 05:22:51.878 align:start position:0%
asset back out and purchase something in
 
05:22:53.590 --> 05:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
their old own name but then they would
 
05:22:55.830 --> 05:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately be going through because the
 
05:22:57.548 --> 05:22:57.558 align:start position:0%
the bill as written has a grandfathering
 
05:22:59.310 --> 05:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
clause any new entity that was formed to
 
05:23:00.788 --> 05:23:00.798 align:start position:0%
try to accomplish the same estate
 
05:23:03.190 --> 05:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
planning purposes uh would then be
 
05:23:06.110 --> 05:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
considered a non-natural person at that
 
05:23:07.990 --> 05:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
time ones that were formed before might
 
05:23:09.788 --> 05:23:09.798 align:start position:0%
be ex but I think it could complicate
 
05:23:12.110 --> 05:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
people's planning going forward and
 
05:23:13.910 --> 05:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
actually Mr chair if I could make one
 
05:23:15.868 --> 05:23:15.878 align:start position:0%
additional Point um I also think that
 
05:23:18.430 --> 05:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
this bill um significantly jeopardizes
 
05:23:20.030 --> 05:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
new housing new development of
 
05:23:21.750 --> 05:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
affordable housing uh so one of the
 
05:23:24.750 --> 05:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
areas that uh I'm looking to break into
 
05:23:27.548 --> 05:23:27.558 align:start position:0%
is um is litec development so low-income
 
05:23:30.150 --> 05:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
housing tax credit development and uh
 
05:23:32.190 --> 05:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
those projects uh tend to be relatively
 
05:23:35.390 --> 05:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
low yield and they are very long-term uh
 
05:23:37.030 --> 05:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
time commitments so you're going to go
 
05:23:38.868 --> 05:23:38.878 align:start position:0%
and and purchase your property and
 
05:23:41.390 --> 05:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
execute as one of these non-natural
 
05:23:43.190 --> 05:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
people you're not going to buy and build
 
05:23:45.708 --> 05:23:45.718 align:start position:0%
you know an 80 unit apartment complex as
 
05:23:47.270 --> 05:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know Chris Freeman dude from Keane
 
05:23:48.948 --> 05:23:48.958 align:start position:0%
it's going to be you
 
05:23:51.470 --> 05:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
know Riverside Park Apartments or
 
05:23:52.948 --> 05:23:52.958 align:start position:0%
something like that so I think you would
 
05:23:54.948 --> 05:23:54.958 align:start position:0%
see a pretty uh significant chilling
 
05:23:56.590 --> 05:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
effect on investment even in affordable
 
05:23:58.590 --> 05:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
housing If This Were to
 
05:24:01.190 --> 05:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
pass representative
 
05:24:03.670 --> 05:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:24:05.788 --> 05:24:05.798 align:start position:0%
for coming in um this afternoon to
 
05:24:08.788 --> 05:24:08.798 align:start position:0%
testify I have a question about your
 
05:24:10.948 --> 05:24:10.958 align:start position:0%
sorry about your discussion of the money
 
05:24:13.190 --> 05:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
supply how does the level of the money
 
05:24:16.510 --> 05:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
supply relate to the need of New
 
05:24:18.990 --> 05:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents for
 
05:24:21.350 --> 05:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
housing so all prices in a market
 
05:24:23.548 --> 05:24:23.558 align:start position:0%
economy are going to be impacted by the
 
05:24:25.948 --> 05:24:25.958 align:start position:0%
amount of currency and circulation
 
05:24:28.270 --> 05:24:28.280 align:start position:0%
relative to other Commodities so when
 
05:24:31.070 --> 05:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
you add new new money into circulation
 
05:24:33.750 --> 05:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
all prices rise that's a a fundamental
 
05:24:36.070 --> 05:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
principle of Economics it's the the laws
 
05:24:37.910 --> 05:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
of Economics which supersede the laws of
 
05:24:39.310 --> 05:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
the legis
 
05:24:41.788 --> 05:24:41.798 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that tends to happen
 
05:24:45.948 --> 05:24:45.958 align:start position:0%
with uh money supply is um there's
 
05:24:48.670 --> 05:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
there's what we refer to in finance as
 
05:24:51.590 --> 05:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
the time value of money which represents
 
05:24:55.150 --> 05:24:55.160 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for money to earn to to
 
05:24:57.990 --> 05:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
generate earnings to generate yield and
 
05:24:59.830 --> 05:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
um so there's a tendency when you add
 
05:25:02.830 --> 05:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
new money uh to circulation that the
 
05:25:04.948 --> 05:25:04.958 align:start position:0%
people who benefit the most are the
 
05:25:07.470 --> 05:25:07.480 align:start position:0%
people who receive the money first and
 
05:25:09.430 --> 05:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
when you are dumping new money into
 
05:25:11.868 --> 05:25:11.878 align:start position:0%
circulation that's Banks and major
 
05:25:13.750 --> 05:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
financial institutions get paid before
 
05:25:16.990 --> 05:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:20.830 --> 05:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
does all set okay any other questions
 
05:25:22.510 --> 05:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Freeman for your
 
05:25:24.548 --> 05:25:24.558 align:start position:0%
testimony all right anybody else here to
 
05:25:27.948 --> 05:25:27.958 align:start position:0%
testify on HB 623 seeing none I'm going
 
05:25:30.868 --> 05:25:30.878 align:start position:0%
to close the public hearing at 3:38 um
 
05:25:32.830 --> 05:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to I believe
 
05:25:36.670 --> 05:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
representative Paige wants to caucus
 
05:25:40.470 --> 05:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
briefly yeah so let's have the
 
05:25:40.480 --> 05:25:42.548 align:start position:0%
briefly yeah so let's have the
Republicans

05:25:42.548 --> 05:25:42.558 align:start position:0%
Republicans
 
05:25:44.750 --> 05:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
um okay all right and then we're going
 
05:25:46.708 --> 05:25:46.718 align:start position:0%
to caucus in this room briefly so if I T
 
05:25:49.030 --> 05:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
can turn this turn off the stream um
 
05:25:53.990 --> 05:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:56.270 --> 05:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
3:55 and if the public could clear the
 
05:26:07.230 --> 05:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:07.240 --> 05:26:37.230 align:start position:0%

Brey okay so I'm going to welcome back
 
05:36:02.548 --> 05:36:02.558 align:start position:0%

you I'm not recognizing you recognizing
 
05:36:14.788 --> 05:36:14.798 align:start position:0%
I opened up the executive session I'm
 
05:36:16.350 --> 05:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
recognizing representative Daxton for a
 
05:36:17.948 --> 05:36:17.958 align:start position:0%
motion we'll see if that's allowed
 
05:36:19.868 --> 05:36:19.878 align:start position:0%
you're not recognized representative
 
05:36:19.878 --> 05:36:21.350 align:start position:0%
you're not recognized representative
representative

05:36:21.350 --> 05:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:36:25.470 --> 05:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
Daxton uh this is with regards to HP 444
 
05:36:28.830 --> 05:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
I move itl is there a second to that yes
 
05:36:30.948 --> 05:36:30.958 align:start position:0%
second representative Aaron seconds it
 
05:36:33.590 --> 05:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
motion is to itl um representative
 
05:36:36.150 --> 05:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
taxton would you like to speak to that
 
05:36:39.430 --> 05:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
motion uh
 
05:36:43.190 --> 05:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
444 I I think that the bill I think that
 
05:36:46.868 --> 05:36:46.878 align:start position:0%
the public has other remedies at
 
05:36:49.030 --> 05:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
and I think that there are other
 
05:36:50.708 --> 05:36:50.718 align:start position:0%
opportunities and remedies for the
 
05:36:53.110 --> 05:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
consumer and the public to purchase
 
05:36:56.708 --> 05:36:56.718 align:start position:0%
property I think that it is an over
 
05:36:59.230 --> 05:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
complication of the real estate transfer
 
05:37:02.150 --> 05:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
process to require 45 days written
 
05:37:05.590 --> 05:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
notice to the tenants in the building
 
05:37:08.310 --> 05:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
and it is an unfair un
 
05:37:10.868 --> 05:37:10.878 align:start position:0%
confiscation of property rights from the
 
05:37:14.030 --> 05:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:16.910 --> 05:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
property okay anybody else wish to speak
 
05:37:19.390 --> 05:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
on this representative
 
05:37:23.070 --> 05:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair um I do have an
 
05:37:26.510 --> 05:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
amendment uh to uh a proposed amendment
 
05:37:29.670 --> 05:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
to HB 444 and therefore I would like to
 
05:37:31.830 --> 05:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
move OTP so that we can discuss the
 
05:37:33.910 --> 05:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
amendment um representative Gibbs if the
 
05:37:36.788 --> 05:37:36.798 align:start position:0%
itl motion fails you are welcome to
 
05:37:40.350 --> 05:37:40.360 align:start position:0%
offer the o TP motion and offer your
 
05:37:42.470 --> 05:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment but right now the motion is
 
05:37:45.310 --> 05:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
itl representative Hicks Mr chairman
 
05:37:47.270 --> 05:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
with the same thing apply um if I wanted
 
05:37:49.670 --> 05:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
to recommend a study committee or to
 
05:37:50.670 --> 05:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
retain the
 
05:37:54.070 --> 05:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
bill well speak you can speak to
 
05:37:55.670 --> 05:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
anything as a member of the committee
 
05:37:57.670 --> 05:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
sure but you can't make a motion for a
 
05:37:59.590 --> 05:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
study committee or anything else until
 
05:38:01.470 --> 05:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
the itl motion is dispensed of so can I
 
05:38:04.350 --> 05:38:04.360 align:start position:0%
speak to the itl go ahead uh the reason
 
05:38:05.788 --> 05:38:05.798 align:start position:0%
I'd like to retain this is I think we've
 
05:38:08.910 --> 05:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
seen success with this with manufactured
 
05:38:11.510 --> 05:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
um homes and I think there's a merit to
 
05:38:13.150 --> 05:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
this that shouldn't just be discounted
 
05:38:15.590 --> 05:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
outright by the itl so I think retaining
 
05:38:16.990 --> 05:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
this or study committee or something
 
05:38:19.230 --> 05:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
like that would uh would help us flesh
 
05:38:22.150 --> 05:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
this up more thank
 
05:38:26.030 --> 05:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
you other members of the committee
 
05:38:28.470 --> 05:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
represent bolo I just wanted to you know
 
05:38:29.990 --> 05:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
really point out in in the testimony
 
05:38:31.990 --> 05:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
really highlight how detrimental any
 
05:38:33.990 --> 05:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
amount of delay would be to 1031
 
05:38:36.070 --> 05:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
exchanges and that is something that a
 
05:38:37.190 --> 05:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
lot of people in the real estate
 
05:38:39.510 --> 05:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
industry indry uh used so I really think
 
05:38:40.948 --> 05:38:40.958 align:start position:0%
that there's some serious unended
 
05:38:42.548 --> 05:38:42.558 align:start position:0%
consequences to this the other thing I
 
05:38:44.708 --> 05:38:44.718 align:start position:0%
would point out is you know regarding um
 
05:38:46.230 --> 05:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know manufactured housing Parks
 
05:38:48.628 --> 05:38:48.638 align:start position:0%
which are very very different but you
 
05:38:51.110 --> 05:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
know we have not really seen a whole lot
 
05:38:53.670 --> 05:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
of development of those ever since that
 
05:38:56.548 --> 05:38:56.558 align:start position:0%
you know law was passed so um for those
 
05:38:59.390 --> 05:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
reasons I would uh support itl
 
05:38:59.400 --> 05:39:00.590 align:start position:0%
reasons I would uh support itl
representative

05:39:00.590 --> 05:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:39:04.270 --> 05:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
Reed so maybe you didn't hear um and
 
05:39:07.510 --> 05:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
certainly Community Loan Fund can talk
 
05:39:10.150 --> 05:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
about this uh it's been wildly
 
05:39:13.628 --> 05:39:13.638 align:start position:0%
successful uh and all of the issues that
 
05:39:16.868 --> 05:39:16.878 align:start position:0%
were raised that Were Somehow different
 
05:39:20.468 --> 05:39:20.478 align:start position:0%
between manufactured housing parks and
 
05:39:23.390 --> 05:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
um multif family housing
 
05:39:26.030 --> 05:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
structures those are the same issues
 
05:39:27.310 --> 05:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
that are faced by the manufactured
 
05:39:29.910 --> 05:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
housing so when one that was raised was
 
05:39:33.110 --> 05:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
repairs yes they actually roll that into
 
05:39:35.750 --> 05:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
I know this cuz I'm helping right now a
 
05:39:37.670 --> 05:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
community and manufactured housing in
 
05:39:40.548 --> 05:39:40.558 align:start position:0%
Danville go Co-op so yes they have to
 
05:39:43.390 --> 05:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
roll into it all of the repairs um
 
05:39:45.350 --> 05:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
shared costs that's something that
 
05:39:46.750 --> 05:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Parks also deal
 
05:39:49.548 --> 05:39:49.558 align:start position:0%
with one was uh brought up about
 
05:39:52.750 --> 05:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
um structures that were like rented out
 
05:39:54.510 --> 05:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
and owned by the community at large
 
05:39:56.230 --> 05:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's also handled in manufactured
 
05:39:57.708 --> 05:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
housing Parks so like if you were buying
 
05:39:59.548 --> 05:39:59.558 align:start position:0%
a multif family house with that the
 
05:40:01.708 --> 05:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
first floor was a business that would be
 
05:40:04.310 --> 05:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
rented out by the community so all of
 
05:40:06.270 --> 05:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
these issues that were raised actually
 
05:40:08.310 --> 05:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
are already being dealt with with by
 
05:40:10.670 --> 05:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturer housing parks and the idea
 
05:40:12.788 --> 05:40:12.798 align:start position:0%
that that has not been successful since
 
05:40:15.788 --> 05:40:15.798 align:start position:0%
the law passed in 1988 is absolutely not
 
05:40:20.750 --> 05:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
true over 200 of these have gone Co-op
 
05:40:22.750 --> 05:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
and they are doing much better than the
 
05:40:24.868 --> 05:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
parks that have not both in terms of
 
05:40:28.230 --> 05:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
more affordable lot rents and better
 
05:40:30.230 --> 05:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
quality representative Dumont and then
 
05:40:30.240 --> 05:40:31.948 align:start position:0%
quality representative Dumont and then
representative

05:40:31.948 --> 05:40:31.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:40:34.030 --> 05:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
Gibbs for me the largest difference
 
05:40:36.150 --> 05:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
between the manufactured home homes and
 
05:40:37.510 --> 05:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
the multif family units say the
 
05:40:39.070 --> 05:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes nine times that you
 
05:40:40.310 --> 05:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
just speak up a little bit I think I
 
05:40:42.390 --> 05:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
apologize for me the manufactured homes
 
05:40:44.390 --> 05:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
the main difference is is that normally
 
05:40:46.590 --> 05:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
those homeowners own the trailer or the
 
05:40:48.468 --> 05:40:48.478 align:start position:0%
manufactured home that they are living
 
05:40:50.788 --> 05:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
within where multi multif family units
 
05:40:52.910 --> 05:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
they do not so for them to get an
 
05:40:54.910 --> 05:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity in the Manufactured Homes
 
05:40:57.310 --> 05:40:57.320 align:start position:0%
parks to purchase out that Park when it
 
05:40:59.070 --> 05:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
goes for sale makes more sense than it
 
05:41:00.628 --> 05:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
would be for a multif family home so for
 
05:41:02.150 --> 05:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
that reason I would support
 
05:41:05.990 --> 05:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
itl representative Gibbs thank you uh I
 
05:41:08.030 --> 05:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
think the last speaker and also the
 
05:41:11.628 --> 05:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
speaker before um representative Reed um
 
05:41:15.468 --> 05:41:15.478 align:start position:0%
both um made part of the explanation for
 
05:41:18.590 --> 05:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
my proposed amendment and that is that
 
05:41:21.310 --> 05:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
one of the main objections dur to this
 
05:41:24.190 --> 05:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
bill during the public hearing was that
 
05:41:25.910 --> 05:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
there's substantial difference between
 
05:41:28.390 --> 05:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
the manufactured housing Park and multif
 
05:41:30.510 --> 05:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
family housing and therefore the
 
05:41:34.270 --> 05:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
amendment totally takes out of the uh
 
05:41:37.830 --> 05:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
proposed bill um any reference two
 
05:41:40.990 --> 05:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
procedures for um manufactured housing
 
05:41:43.230 --> 05:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
Parks because they are different from
 
05:41:46.110 --> 05:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
multif family housing and the other um
 
05:41:48.708 --> 05:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
objection was that 60 days is too long
 
05:41:51.230 --> 05:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
and might interfere with closings so for
 
05:41:53.628 --> 05:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
that reason uh the amendment proposed is
 
05:41:59.030 --> 05:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:00.990 --> 05:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
days further
 
05:42:03.468 --> 05:42:03.478 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Reed I just
 
05:42:07.628 --> 05:42:07.638 align:start position:0%
don't understand why like can
 
05:42:09.230 --> 05:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
and not to single you out representative
 
05:42:12.670 --> 05:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
D but you you did just bring this up why
 
05:42:14.788 --> 05:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
would there be a discrimination against
 
05:42:17.750 --> 05:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
people if they can get the financing and
 
05:42:19.948 --> 05:42:19.958 align:start position:0%
that financing is on the lending
 
05:42:22.150 --> 05:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
institution the the seller gets the
 
05:42:23.830 --> 05:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
money so why would there be a
 
05:42:25.788 --> 05:42:25.798 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on people who have
 
05:42:29.548 --> 05:42:29.558 align:start position:0%
not yet owned a home like that doesn't
 
05:42:30.948 --> 05:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
make any sense why would be like well
 
05:42:33.110 --> 05:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
those people bought something and so
 
05:42:34.468 --> 05:42:34.478 align:start position:0%
they they should have the right but
 
05:42:36.628 --> 05:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
these other people haven't that that
 
05:42:38.910 --> 05:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense at all to me and
 
05:42:40.590 --> 05:42:40.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if you can explain
 
05:42:43.110 --> 05:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
why we wouldn't be actively trying to
 
05:42:45.868 --> 05:42:45.878 align:start position:0%
get more people to own homes
 
05:42:47.868 --> 05:42:47.878 align:start position:0%
representative sure and I appreciate the
 
05:42:49.628 --> 05:42:49.638 align:start position:0%
question uh it's not an act of
 
05:42:51.468 --> 05:42:51.478 align:start position:0%
discrimination those groups already have
 
05:42:53.230 --> 05:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
the ability to come together and
 
05:42:54.628 --> 05:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
purchase that multif family dwelling
 
05:42:56.868 --> 05:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
just like any other group would be this
 
05:42:58.788 --> 05:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
makes it mandatory that you offer that
 
05:43:00.230 --> 05:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
to them the same way that you would a
 
05:43:02.868 --> 05:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
manufactured home it it's not the same
 
05:43:04.590 --> 05:43:04.600 align:start position:0%
process there's big differences between
 
05:43:06.830 --> 05:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
the two there's no discrimination by by
 
05:43:08.230 --> 05:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
saying saying that we're going to itl
 
05:43:11.430 --> 05:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
this if a if 10 or 15 or 20 or 40 people
 
05:43:12.830 --> 05:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
want to come together in a multif family
 
05:43:14.990 --> 05:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
unit and group together their funds and
 
05:43:16.788 --> 05:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
make an offer they have every right to
 
05:43:16.798 --> 05:43:17.510 align:start position:0%
make an offer they have every right to
do

05:43:17.510 --> 05:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:43:17.520 --> 05:43:19.990 align:start position:0%
do
that

05:43:19.990 --> 05:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:43:23.350 --> 05:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative so technically even
 
05:43:23.360 --> 05:43:24.510 align:start position:0%
representative so technically even
before

05:43:24.510 --> 05:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:43:27.628 --> 05:43:27.638 align:start position:0%
1988 residents of a manufactured housing
 
05:43:29.788 --> 05:43:29.798 align:start position:0%
community had the ability to come
 
05:43:31.430 --> 05:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
together but the problem is that people
 
05:43:33.390 --> 05:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
who are buying just like today buying
 
05:43:35.150 --> 05:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
multif family people who were buying
 
05:43:37.110 --> 05:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
those Parks could buy without the
 
05:43:38.788 --> 05:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
residents they would close without the
 
05:43:41.390 --> 05:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
residents ever even knowing that the the
 
05:43:43.510 --> 05:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
property was for sale so the only thing
 
05:43:45.708 --> 05:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
this is doing is doing what ended up
 
05:43:48.230 --> 05:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
allowing those people the opportunity
 
05:43:49.350 --> 05:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
which is to just give them a
 
05:43:52.310 --> 05:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
notification of sale and especially with
 
05:43:55.230 --> 05:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment that would only be 45 days
 
05:43:57.430 --> 05:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
hardly anything closes that fast anyway
 
05:44:00.190 --> 05:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't even reference the RSA
 
05:44:02.270 --> 05:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
around manufactured housing Parks but
 
05:44:04.830 --> 05:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
the the point is is that like that
 
05:44:05.948 --> 05:44:05.958 align:start position:0%
you're saying they already have the
 
05:44:08.110 --> 05:44:08.120 align:start position:0%
chance but def yes just like
 
05:44:09.670 --> 05:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing residents had the
 
05:44:12.350 --> 05:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
chance before 1988 but de facto they
 
05:44:13.750 --> 05:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
didn't because they didn't know it was
 
05:44:16.708 --> 05:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
for sale and the same is true now of
 
05:44:19.430 --> 05:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
multif family residents they don't know
 
05:44:21.150 --> 05:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
it's for sale and all of a sudden they
 
05:44:22.948 --> 05:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
have a new
 
05:44:25.590 --> 05:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
owner I mean anything's for sale it just
 
05:44:27.708 --> 05:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
depends how much you offer it I guess
 
05:44:29.670 --> 05:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
like there's nothing to respond to that
 
05:44:32.750 --> 05:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing stopping tenants from or
 
05:44:35.110 --> 05:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
people that live in one big unit of
 
05:44:36.468 --> 05:44:36.478 align:start position:0%
getting together similar to the way you
 
05:44:38.590 --> 05:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
form a union I mean coming together
 
05:44:39.750 --> 05:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
organizing and saying you know what we
 
05:44:40.948 --> 05:44:40.958 align:start position:0%
want to purchase this property
 
05:44:42.190 --> 05:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
anything's for sale it doesn't matter
 
05:44:44.590 --> 05:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
how much it like it is what it is you
 
05:44:45.868 --> 05:44:45.878 align:start position:0%
know like they'll sell it depending on
 
05:44:47.590 --> 05:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
what the price
 
05:44:49.708 --> 05:44:49.718 align:start position:0%
is did you want to go representative
 
05:44:51.510 --> 05:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
deont go ahead yeah thank you and I do
 
05:44:52.788 --> 05:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the discussion in my
 
05:44:54.510 --> 05:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
mind just the great or the bigger
 
05:44:55.750 --> 05:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
difference there is the fact that the
 
05:44:57.190 --> 05:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
manufactured home law that you speak of
 
05:44:59.910 --> 05:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
that came in 1988 was strictly because
 
05:45:02.270 --> 05:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
that majority of those people owned the
 
05:45:04.270 --> 05:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
property sitting on that land which is
 
05:45:05.868 --> 05:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
why it was a greater importance to let
 
05:45:07.468 --> 05:45:07.478 align:start position:0%
them know what was going to happen so
 
05:45:09.310 --> 05:45:09.320 align:start position:0%
that way that land wasn't just sold out
 
05:45:11.030 --> 05:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
from underneath them there is a big
 
05:45:12.750 --> 05:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
difference to that versus multif family
 
05:45:14.948 --> 05:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
units who there a leas holder stake
 
05:45:16.548 --> 05:45:16.558 align:start position:0%
versus an actual ownership interest in
 
05:45:18.868 --> 05:45:18.878 align:start position:0%
those other Parks but thank you
 
05:45:18.878 --> 05:45:20.070 align:start position:0%
those other Parks but thank you
representative

05:45:20.070 --> 05:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:45:21.830 --> 05:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank
 
05:45:25.350 --> 05:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
you um just to clarify if the amendment
 
05:45:27.788 --> 05:45:27.798 align:start position:0%
is approved there would be no reference
 
05:45:30.030 --> 05:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
in the statute to the procedures for
 
05:45:32.270 --> 05:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing parks that would be
 
05:45:35.510 --> 05:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
totally eliminated and what the bill
 
05:45:37.548 --> 05:45:37.558 align:start position:0%
what the remaining bill would do
 
05:45:40.190 --> 05:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
would be to provide notice to tenants
 
05:45:42.390 --> 05:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
that the building is going to be sold
 
05:45:44.510 --> 05:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
and it would address the problem that
 
05:45:46.430 --> 05:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
we've heard about that there are tenants
 
05:45:48.708 --> 05:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
who only find out that the building they
 
05:45:50.948 --> 05:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
live in has been settled when they get a
 
05:45:53.150 --> 05:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
notice from the new owner that their
 
05:45:55.830 --> 05:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
rent is being substantially increased so
 
05:45:58.708 --> 05:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
all this is saying is that In fairness
 
05:46:00.750 --> 05:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
they should have an opportunity to know
 
05:46:03.430 --> 05:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:05.590 --> 05:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
happens represent
 
05:46:09.110 --> 05:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you you um to the extent
 
05:46:09.120 --> 05:46:10.110 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you you um to the extent
someone

05:46:10.110 --> 05:46:10.120 align:start position:0%
someone
 
05:46:12.948 --> 05:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
owns a what we used to call trailer
 
05:46:15.670 --> 05:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
manufactured house um and that gives
 
05:46:17.590 --> 05:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
them more buyin I mean ultimately
 
05:46:19.468 --> 05:46:19.478 align:start position:0%
housing insecure is housing insecure
 
05:46:23.190 --> 05:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
homeless is homeless um and the ability
 
05:46:24.788 --> 05:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
and this is an issue that the people I'm
 
05:46:27.628 --> 05:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
helping in Danville are facing which is
 
05:46:30.590 --> 05:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
if somebody buys it and they jack up the
 
05:46:33.110 --> 05:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
lot rent to something unaffordable now
 
05:46:34.750 --> 05:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
they're stuck owning something that they
 
05:46:37.030 --> 05:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
can't pay the lot rent on and they can't
 
05:46:38.590 --> 05:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
sell because nobody else wants to pay
 
05:46:40.990 --> 05:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
the lot rent so you end up being
 
05:46:42.910 --> 05:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
homeless and homeless is homeless and as
 
05:46:45.230 --> 05:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
ingratiated as I am that the chair has
 
05:46:47.110 --> 05:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
joined the ranks of my comrades talking
 
05:46:50.190 --> 05:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
about unions um I
 
05:46:55.070 --> 05:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
think finally I finally did it um uh I
 
05:46:57.788 --> 05:46:57.798 align:start position:0%
think that you can say yes technically
 
05:47:00.750 --> 05:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
they had anything's for sale and maybe
 
05:47:02.310 --> 05:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
that's the way a person with billions of
 
05:47:04.150 --> 05:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
dollars laying around thinks but these
 
05:47:06.150 --> 05:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
people don't normally think that and we
 
05:47:09.030 --> 05:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
know from real world information right
 
05:47:10.390 --> 05:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
we know that
 
05:47:12.548 --> 05:47:12.558 align:start position:0%
pre-1988 manufactured housing Park
 
05:47:14.390 --> 05:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
communities did not have the
 
05:47:16.548 --> 05:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
wherewithall to come together and make
 
05:47:18.830 --> 05:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
those offers once they had that chance
 
05:47:20.390 --> 05:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
to do that that's when they started
 
05:47:21.868 --> 05:47:21.878 align:start position:0%
coming together and doing that and doing
 
05:47:24.990 --> 05:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
it successfully so we know that that
 
05:47:27.708 --> 05:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
notification resulted in actual people
 
05:47:30.230 --> 05:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
buying homes um or buying the land under
 
05:47:32.990 --> 05:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
their home so while it's technically
 
05:47:35.190 --> 05:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
true Mr chair I would say that
 
05:47:36.628 --> 05:47:36.638 align:start position:0%
notification has proven in the real
 
05:47:38.750 --> 05:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
world world to be vital to the actual
 
05:47:42.990 --> 05:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
realizing of that okay represent Volo so
 
05:47:44.830 --> 05:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
so um if I could just ask to followup
 
05:47:46.990 --> 05:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
question that so is really what is
 
05:47:49.230 --> 05:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
needed really what you're driving at is
 
05:47:49.240 --> 05:47:50.030 align:start position:0%
needed really what you're driving at is
the

05:47:50.030 --> 05:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:47:52.510 --> 05:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
notification versus the opportunity to
 
05:47:54.230 --> 05:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
purchase because to me what really
 
05:47:56.468 --> 05:47:56.478 align:start position:0%
really I really don't like about this is
 
05:47:59.030 --> 05:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
it basically freezes the sale process
 
05:48:01.270 --> 05:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
for 45 days and spends a lot of time on
 
05:48:03.110 --> 05:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
that if there was just a simple notice
 
05:48:04.510 --> 05:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
that would be different but this is
 
05:48:07.548 --> 05:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
effectively every time you're trying to
 
05:48:09.468 --> 05:48:09.478 align:start position:0%
sell the property you have to say okay
 
05:48:11.628 --> 05:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
wait let's wait 45 or actually 60 days
 
05:48:13.150 --> 05:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
because we're looking at the unamended
 
05:48:16.590 --> 05:48:16.600 align:start position:0%
version you know just sit and and and
 
05:48:19.670 --> 05:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
wait go ahead uh thank you for the
 
05:48:22.468 --> 05:48:22.478 align:start position:0%
question um I'm afraid that maybe you're
 
05:48:25.390 --> 05:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
not maybe misinterpreting the original
 
05:48:27.948 --> 05:48:27.958 align:start position:0%
law it is a 60-day notice of sale that
 
05:48:31.070 --> 05:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
is all it is and it says that a landlord
 
05:48:32.750 --> 05:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
if the the tenants come together and
 
05:48:34.468 --> 05:48:34.478 align:start position:0%
make an offer the landlord will consider
 
05:48:37.070 --> 05:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
that offer there's an extra piece which
 
05:48:38.830 --> 05:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
if the it's amended would no longer be
 
05:48:40.628 --> 05:48:40.638 align:start position:0%
referenced that said well the landl will
 
05:48:42.190 --> 05:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
give a little extra time to get the
 
05:48:44.510 --> 05:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
financing for that offer but ultimately
 
05:48:46.910 --> 05:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
at its heart all it is is 60-day notice
 
05:48:50.310 --> 05:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
of sale that's it or amended version 45
 
05:48:53.990 --> 05:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
days that is all it is so that time
 
05:48:55.830 --> 05:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
period gives them the opportunity to
 
05:48:57.310 --> 05:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
make a decision whether or not to come
 
05:48:58.590 --> 05:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
together and see if they can get
 
05:49:00.910 --> 05:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
financing but that whether or not they
 
05:49:03.548 --> 05:49:03.558 align:start position:0%
choose to do that is irrelevant they may
 
05:49:05.310 --> 05:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
not choose to do that this is just
 
05:49:07.628 --> 05:49:07.638 align:start position:0%
giving them notification of sale and
 
05:49:10.070 --> 05:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's before it's 60 days before closing
 
05:49:12.788 --> 05:49:12.798 align:start position:0%
which most of the time it take and maybe
 
05:49:14.510 --> 05:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
not so much in this market but certainly
 
05:49:16.468 --> 05:49:16.478 align:start position:0%
with multi-million dollar deals it
 
05:49:18.110 --> 05:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
usually takes more than that to close
 
05:49:19.628 --> 05:49:19.638 align:start position:0%
anyway because you have inspections and
 
05:49:22.110 --> 05:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
all sorts of different processes in
 
05:49:24.910 --> 05:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
there I'm G representative Miner then
 
05:49:27.750 --> 05:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks and representative
 
05:49:31.230 --> 05:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
paage thank you Mr chairman and I'm just
 
05:49:33.350 --> 05:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
curious I I've been through the the
 
05:49:35.070 --> 05:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
process with selling mobile home parks
 
05:49:37.270 --> 05:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
I've done it three times
 
05:49:40.990 --> 05:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
it is not actually that quick and
 
05:49:43.590 --> 05:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
easy um especially when they're coming
 
05:49:46.190 --> 05:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
back and saying you know we could use a
 
05:49:48.510 --> 05:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
little more time this financing wasn't
 
05:49:50.590 --> 05:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
working can we use a little more time
 
05:49:53.468 --> 05:49:53.478 align:start position:0%
it's it really is a lot longer than that
 
05:49:55.430 --> 05:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
process I don't know if that was out of
 
05:49:56.670 --> 05:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
line or if I was supposed to even say
 
05:49:58.750 --> 05:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
that but I have done it three times and
 
05:50:02.788 --> 05:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
it's never been quick and easy and it's
 
05:50:04.510 --> 05:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
although I'm grateful that they did
 
05:50:09.310 --> 05:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
Co-op it was not easy and not fun not
 
05:50:12.548 --> 05:50:12.558 align:start position:0%
fun at all represent Hicks yeah thank
 
05:50:15.110 --> 05:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
you um this is why I was hoping we could
 
05:50:16.628 --> 05:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
maybe retain this because it's been a
 
05:50:19.110 --> 05:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
great discussion and I think um there is
 
05:50:21.670 --> 05:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
room for compromise here so uh if people
 
05:50:23.948 --> 05:50:23.958 align:start position:0%
would entertain that thought that maybe
 
05:50:26.110 --> 05:50:26.120 align:start position:0%
we keep this around and not just itl it
 
05:50:27.910 --> 05:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
that I'd be grateful thank you thank you
 
05:50:29.948 --> 05:50:29.958 align:start position:0%
um represent
 
05:50:32.270 --> 05:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
paig I was just going to follow up on
 
05:50:35.070 --> 05:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
the comment um from my colleague from
 
05:50:38.270 --> 05:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
Littleton um you know if if there is
 
05:50:41.628 --> 05:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
desire or willingness to find a
 
05:50:43.030 --> 05:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
compromise here where we're just talking
 
05:50:45.510 --> 05:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
about notice I think the amendment that
 
05:50:47.390 --> 05:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
Merill spoke to pushes in that direction
 
05:50:51.468 --> 05:50:51.478 align:start position:0%
anyhow but if um the Republicans on
 
05:50:53.390 --> 05:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
caucus are amable to the idea of
 
05:50:55.310 --> 05:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
something that's more narrowly T
 
05:50:57.510 --> 05:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
tailored just around the notice I think
 
05:50:59.788 --> 05:50:59.798 align:start position:0%
that would be worth discussion well I
 
05:51:01.548 --> 05:51:01.558 align:start position:0%
would say in response to that if the itl
 
05:51:03.708 --> 05:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
motion fails then you're welcome to
 
05:51:05.830 --> 05:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
offer another motion representative
 
05:51:05.840 --> 05:51:07.430 align:start position:0%
offer another motion representative
Gibbs

05:51:07.430 --> 05:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
Gibbs
 
05:51:10.990 --> 05:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um I just um point out that I
 
05:51:13.390 --> 05:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
would be open to a further amendment
 
05:51:15.548 --> 05:51:15.558 align:start position:0%
that would remove the reference to the
 
05:51:18.670 --> 05:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make an offer to the um
 
05:51:21.230 --> 05:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to make an offer uh and
 
05:51:24.310 --> 05:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
so that this is just purely notice to
 
05:51:26.830 --> 05:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
remove the element of unfairness of the
 
05:51:28.708 --> 05:51:28.718 align:start position:0%
tenant only finding out that the
 
05:51:30.830 --> 05:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
building is being sold after there's a
 
05:51:30.840 --> 05:51:31.990 align:start position:0%
building is being sold after there's a
new

05:51:31.990 --> 05:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
new
 
05:51:35.468 --> 05:51:35.478 align:start position:0%
owner representative Reed um and I'm
 
05:51:37.270 --> 05:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
sorry I can't see all the way down but
 
05:51:39.110 --> 05:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
the representative that said that you've
 
05:51:40.788 --> 05:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
worked with three different uh
 
05:51:43.030 --> 05:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing parks to sell them
 
05:51:45.270 --> 05:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
um did I understand you correctly that
 
05:51:47.830 --> 05:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
um not all of them went
 
05:51:51.708 --> 05:51:51.718 align:start position:0%
Co-op go ahead yes that's correct okay
 
05:51:54.350 --> 05:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
uh two one of them had co-oped out of
 
05:51:57.830 --> 05:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
the three thank you and I think the
 
05:51:59.548 --> 05:51:59.558 align:start position:0%
point that you Illustrated is a very
 
05:52:02.150 --> 05:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
good point which is the sale takes a
 
05:52:05.270 --> 05:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
long time usually longer than 60 days so
 
05:52:07.350 --> 05:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
that notification period and again we
 
05:52:08.990 --> 05:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
can say are they're allowed to make an
 
05:52:11.670 --> 05:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
offer or not they are allowed to make an
 
05:52:14.548 --> 05:52:14.558 align:start position:0%
offer that's as the chair very rightly
 
05:52:16.110 --> 05:52:16.120 align:start position:0%
pointed out they're allowed to make an
 
05:52:19.350 --> 05:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
offer at any time um but that 60 days
 
05:52:21.030 --> 05:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
which gives them a little bit of time to
 
05:52:24.510 --> 05:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
do that usually Falls within the period
 
05:52:26.350 --> 05:52:26.360 align:start position:0%
of time it would take for the the seller
 
05:52:27.708 --> 05:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
to go through the process with the
 
05:52:30.948 --> 05:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
current um buyer anyway so if it takes
 
05:52:32.948 --> 05:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
90 days with the current buyer then the
 
05:52:35.628 --> 05:52:35.638 align:start position:0%
60 days is not a problem or 45 even less
 
05:52:38.670 --> 05:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
so representative um
 
05:52:42.628 --> 05:52:42.638 align:start position:0%
Daxton that makes no sense the if if I
 
05:52:44.910 --> 05:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
if I have a property under contract with
 
05:52:47.708 --> 05:52:47.718 align:start position:0%
a investor we'll call this this investor
 
05:52:50.868 --> 05:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
person yes it might take 45 or 60 days
 
05:52:53.910 --> 05:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
to do a transaction but I can't start
 
05:52:56.030 --> 05:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
the transaction till I'm free to
 
05:52:59.468 --> 05:52:59.478 align:start position:0%
transfer title so you're no yes that's
 
05:53:01.468 --> 05:53:01.478 align:start position:0%
how that's not the that's that's not the
 
05:53:03.590 --> 05:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
language of the bill and it's not it's
 
05:53:05.830 --> 05:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
not fining works and that's how purchase
 
05:53:07.750 --> 05:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
and sales work
 
05:53:10.708 --> 05:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
yeah the final acceptance you may
 
05:53:14.310 --> 05:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
respond I may yes um and I'll just pull
 
05:53:16.430 --> 05:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
up the bill that is not the language the
 
05:53:18.190 --> 05:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
successful language of the manufacturer
 
05:53:20.390 --> 05:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
housing law thank you very much I
 
05:53:21.990 --> 05:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and it's not the
 
05:53:24.590 --> 05:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
language of the bill the language is
 
05:53:26.910 --> 05:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
before uh a final unconditional
 
05:53:29.030 --> 05:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
acceptance of any offer so that means
 
05:53:32.070 --> 05:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
closing as in you can't go back it's
 
05:53:35.708 --> 05:53:35.718 align:start position:0%
done so within within the offer within
 
05:53:38.230 --> 05:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
the offer is contingent upon usually
 
05:53:40.310 --> 05:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
things like inspection and other things
 
05:53:42.628 --> 05:53:42.638 align:start position:0%
it's also contingent upon the law and if
 
05:53:44.868 --> 05:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
the law says it has to be 60 days and
 
05:53:47.070 --> 05:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
that's the part that's contingent upon
 
05:53:49.948 --> 05:53:49.958 align:start position:0%
it representative Daxton go ahead and
 
05:53:53.788 --> 05:53:53.798 align:start position:0%
respond why would my buyer want to spend
 
05:53:57.150 --> 05:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
$2,000 on a commercial appraisal and God
 
05:54:00.390 --> 05:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
knows how much money on inspections on a
 
05:54:01.948 --> 05:54:01.958 align:start position:0%
deal that he doesn't know that he can
 
05:54:04.670 --> 05:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
make that makes absolutely no
 
05:54:09.628 --> 05:54:09.638 align:start position:0%
sense and that's okay representative
 
05:54:11.990 --> 05:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
deont just for clarification as someone
 
05:54:14.070 --> 05:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
who deals with pns is quite
 
05:54:16.430 --> 05:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
frequently acceptance of an offer is
 
05:54:19.110 --> 05:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
when two parties or more sign and now
 
05:54:21.910 --> 05:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
you have an effective date there it's
 
05:54:24.190 --> 05:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
not the sale of the property or at
 
05:54:26.350 --> 05:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
closing acceptance of the offer the way
 
05:54:28.070 --> 05:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
that this is worded because it says
 
05:54:30.430 --> 05:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
acceptance of the offer for sale or
 
05:54:32.628 --> 05:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
transfer so this would be prohibiting
 
05:54:34.270 --> 05:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
anybody from signing an offer that's in
 
05:54:36.070 --> 05:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
front of them you'd have to give notice
 
05:54:39.150 --> 05:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
PRI to making that
 
05:54:41.030 --> 05:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
acceptance representative Reed then
 
05:54:43.110 --> 05:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs representative d i
 
05:54:44.830 --> 05:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your response but you're
 
05:54:47.190 --> 05:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
skipping over the two very important and
 
05:54:49.150 --> 05:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
very functional words that are in the
 
05:54:50.910 --> 05:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
current law and have been working for 40
 
05:54:53.590 --> 05:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
years that's final unconditional final
 
05:54:55.830 --> 05:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
unconditional as in when you do an offer
 
05:54:58.548 --> 05:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
it's usually contingent it's conditional
 
05:55:00.350 --> 05:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
on things like inspection and what have
 
05:55:03.110 --> 05:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
you final unconditional is when you are
 
05:55:08.030 --> 05:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
done final done closing so that is what
 
05:55:09.430 --> 05:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
this is referencing and that is the
 
05:55:10.948 --> 05:55:10.958 align:start position:0%
actual practice that the manufactured
 
05:55:12.590 --> 05:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
housing Parks go through in terms of the
 
05:55:15.230 --> 05:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
other um comment that was made why would
 
05:55:17.628 --> 05:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
my buyer go through paying for
 
05:55:19.070 --> 05:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
inspections and what have you when they
 
05:55:21.230 --> 05:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
aren't guaranteed that they'll have the
 
05:55:23.548 --> 05:55:23.558 align:start position:0%
that's true of literally every buyer
 
05:55:25.628 --> 05:55:25.638 align:start position:0%
everyone who makes an offer on a house
 
05:55:27.070 --> 05:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
goes through that
 
05:55:29.510 --> 05:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
process that's you don't know if you're
 
05:55:31.310 --> 05:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
going to actually end up with it because
 
05:55:31.320 --> 05:55:34.868 align:start position:0%
going to actually end up with it because
it's

05:55:34.868 --> 05:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:37.230 --> 05:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
conditional represent
 
05:55:40.708 --> 05:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you just to clarify even if
 
05:55:43.150 --> 05:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
the reference to the opportunity to make
 
05:55:46.548 --> 05:55:46.558 align:start position:0%
an offer is removed from the bill the
 
05:55:48.628 --> 05:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
tenants would still have the opportunity
 
05:55:50.310 --> 05:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
to make an offer several people have
 
05:55:52.750 --> 05:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
pointed out that opportunity always
 
05:55:55.190 --> 05:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
exists anybody can make an offer to buy
 
05:55:56.910 --> 05:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
something and the opportunity would
 
05:55:58.990 --> 05:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
always exist so long as the property
 
05:56:03.468 --> 05:56:03.478 align:start position:0%
hasn't actually already been sold so I'm
 
05:56:06.670 --> 05:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
just trying to clarify that the amended
 
05:56:09.070 --> 05:56:09.080 align:start position:0%
bill would be about
 
05:56:12.150 --> 05:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
notice representative Reed a question of
 
05:56:14.510 --> 05:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
the committee um we're spending a lot of
 
05:56:16.670 --> 05:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
time discussing this so since we're no
 
05:56:18.628 --> 05:56:18.638 align:start position:0%
longer the idea of the amendment no
 
05:56:20.030 --> 05:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
longer directly referencing the
 
05:56:23.070 --> 05:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing um statute that has
 
05:56:25.430 --> 05:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
been successful would the committee
 
05:56:28.548 --> 05:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
therefore be open to language around 60
 
05:56:31.150 --> 05:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
days before close like just straight up
 
05:56:35.788 --> 05:56:35.798 align:start position:0%
or 45 days before close um so why don't
 
05:56:35.798 --> 05:56:37.190 align:start position:0%
or 45 days before close um so why don't
we

05:56:37.190 --> 05:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:56:39.830 --> 05:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
um call the vote on the itl and see
 
05:56:42.110 --> 05:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
where that goes and then if that fails
 
05:56:44.708 --> 05:56:44.718 align:start position:0%
then we can discuss other options for
 
05:56:44.718 --> 05:56:46.230 align:start position:0%
then we can discuss other options for
the

05:56:46.230 --> 05:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:56:48.190 --> 05:56:48.200 align:start position:0%
bill so at this point I'm going to ask
 
05:56:50.350 --> 05:56:50.360 align:start position:0%

would you like to speak to

that yes in most of the testimony there
 
05:59:05.840 --> 05:59:07.070 align:start position:0%
that yes in most of the testimony there
was

05:59:07.070 --> 05:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:59:10.030 --> 05:59:10.040 align:start position:0%
significant questions brought up about
 
05:59:13.030 --> 05:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
some of the legality of this this is
 
05:59:15.110 --> 05:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
information that is readily available in
 
05:59:18.350 --> 05:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
the public domain for the most part and
 
05:59:21.230 --> 05:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
more importantly I believe that there is
 
05:59:24.110 --> 05:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
a potential legal problem on the federal
 
05:59:27.548 --> 05:59:27.558 align:start position:0%
level with this based upon the uh
 
05:59:29.990 --> 05:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
2024 settlement between the National
 
05:59:32.150 --> 05:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors in the United
 
05:59:35.468 --> 05:59:35.478 align:start position:0%
States of America wherein uh
 
05:59:39.628 --> 05:59:39.638 align:start position:0%
compensation and the cost of things were
 
05:59:43.390 --> 05:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
not to be made public and are in fact uh
 
05:59:46.270 --> 05:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
considered non-public information so
 
05:59:48.628 --> 05:59:48.638 align:start position:0%
there's that potential problem as well
 
05:59:51.990 --> 05:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
but fundamentally the the the you you
 
05:59:53.948 --> 05:59:53.958 align:start position:0%
heard from the registar the bill
 
05:59:57.670 --> 05:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
achieves nothing particularly helpful uh
 
05:59:59.390 --> 05:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
and the public does have access to the
 
06:00:01.708 --> 06:00:01.718 align:start position:0%
same information as the supposed
 
06:00:01.718 --> 06:00:03.590 align:start position:0%
same information as the supposed
landlord

06:00:03.590 --> 06:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
06:00:07.670 --> 06:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
class representative Gibbs thank you um
 
06:00:10.230 --> 06:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
based on our earlier conversation I was
 
06:00:11.708 --> 06:00:11.718 align:start position:0%
under the impression that borrowing
 
06:00:14.310 --> 06:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
unusual circumstances we were not going
 
06:00:16.948 --> 06:00:16.958 align:start position:0%
to exec bills on the same day as the
 
06:00:16.958 --> 06:00:19.830 align:start position:0%
to exec bills on the same day as the
public

06:00:19.830 --> 06:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:23.510 --> 06:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
hearing um so perh house rules I noticed
 
06:00:25.548 --> 06:00:25.558 align:start position:0%
um executive session is allowed on
 
06:00:27.150 --> 06:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
pending legislation and I think this is
 
06:00:30.670 --> 06:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
one of those bills um that seem
 
06:00:33.750 --> 06:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
unworkable I did contact and confer with
 
06:00:36.830 --> 06:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
the ranking member um just to notify him
 
06:00:38.948 --> 06:00:38.958 align:start position:0%
that we're going to do this today so I
 
06:00:40.788 --> 06:00:40.798 align:start position:0%
have two bills that we heard today that
 
06:00:43.230 --> 06:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take care of today um for to
 
06:00:44.750 --> 06:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
speed up the
 
06:00:47.868 --> 06:00:47.878 align:start position:0%
process I understand that it's allowed
 
06:00:49.628 --> 06:00:49.638 align:start position:0%
um obviously I understood that when the
 
06:00:52.350 --> 06:00:52.360 align:start position:0%
vote was taken in in the house session
 
06:00:54.628 --> 06:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
um it's just that I think it's a good
 
06:00:56.230 --> 06:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
idea if we have a little time to think
 
06:00:56.240 --> 06:00:57.708 align:start position:0%
idea if we have a little time to think
about

06:00:57.708 --> 06:00:57.718 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:01:02.948 --> 06:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:06.468 --> 06:01:06.478 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none
 
06:01:08.910 --> 06:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
the motion is inexpedient to legislate
 
06:01:10.548 --> 06:01:10.558 align:start position:0%

06:02:26.788 --> 06:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
okay okay so the last bill that I was
 
06:02:29.430 --> 06:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
going to call today is the last one we
 
06:02:31.430 --> 06:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
heard House Bill 623 relative to
 
06:02:33.230 --> 06:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
prohibiting corporations from purchasing
 
06:02:34.670 --> 06:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
single family homes for a certain amount
 
06:02:35.830 --> 06:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
of time I'm going to recognize
 
06:02:38.030 --> 06:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative Cole for a motion make a
 
06:02:40.468 --> 06:02:40.478 align:start position:0%
motion inexpedient legislate is there a
 
06:02:42.350 --> 06:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
second I second that represent bolo
 
06:02:42.360 --> 06:02:44.310 align:start position:0%
second I second that represent bolo
seconds

06:02:44.310 --> 06:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
06:02:46.230 --> 06:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
discussion the bill has written as
 
06:02:48.150 --> 06:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
problematic I think it has a long way to
 
06:02:50.548 --> 06:02:50.558 align:start position:0%
go before it hits prime time so this
 
06:02:52.430 --> 06:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
time it shouldn't go
 
06:02:54.590 --> 06:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
forward representative
 
06:02:57.628 --> 06:02:57.638 align:start position:0%
Paige I I share some concerns about this
 
06:03:01.150 --> 06:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
bill um not going to support this itl
 
06:03:03.350 --> 06:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
motion uh because I have a lot of
 
06:03:04.990 --> 06:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
admiration for what it's trying to do
 
06:03:06.190 --> 06:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
what it's trying to accomplish for
 
06:03:09.150 --> 06:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
granite Staters um you know I think
 
06:03:10.628 --> 06:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
there are some issues here I think the
 
06:03:12.868 --> 06:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
multif family piece that's included in
 
06:03:15.788 --> 06:03:15.798 align:start position:0%
there is probably problematic I think
 
06:03:19.670 --> 06:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
the uh the points that repb Dumont
 
06:03:21.910 --> 06:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
raised um about how this will impact
 
06:03:24.190 --> 06:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
certain kinds of you know llc's and
 
06:03:27.390 --> 06:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
other folks are significant I'd also
 
06:03:29.910 --> 06:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
like to see us work on it personally um
 
06:03:31.948 --> 06:03:31.958 align:start position:0%
so I'll be opposing the
 
06:03:35.910 --> 06:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
itl representative Reed
 
06:03:39.510 --> 06:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
also and I was a co-sponsor on the last
 
06:03:44.788 --> 06:03:44.798 align:start position:0%
term one as well um acknowledge that the
 
06:03:49.910 --> 06:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
language needs work however I never ever
 
06:03:51.750 --> 06:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
support killing something I think it's
 
06:03:53.628 --> 06:03:53.638 align:start position:0%
disingenuous actually to support killing
 
06:03:54.948 --> 06:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
something because the language needs
 
06:03:56.110 --> 06:03:56.120 align:start position:0%
work because if you agree with the
 
06:03:58.230 --> 06:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
underlying intention you should do the
 
06:03:59.590 --> 06:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
work that's why we're here that's why we
 
06:04:02.390 --> 06:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
ask people to vote for us so if you
 
06:04:04.430 --> 06:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
believe in the underlying intention that
 
06:04:06.868 --> 06:04:06.878 align:start position:0%
humans should own homes and not
 
06:04:08.868 --> 06:04:08.878 align:start position:0%
corporations then we should do the work
 
06:04:10.190 --> 06:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
to fix the
 
06:04:12.948 --> 06:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
language yeah I I fundamentally disagree
 
06:04:14.548 --> 06:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
with the whole premise of the bill so
 
06:04:16.948 --> 06:04:16.958 align:start position:0%
that's that's why I F that's fine but
 
06:04:18.190 --> 06:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
that wasn't what I heard and I was
 
06:04:21.270 --> 06:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
addressing this is like llc's are people
 
06:04:24.910 --> 06:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
people own llc's like I mean this is so
 
06:04:27.150 --> 06:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
broad-reaching and the fact that a local
 
06:04:29.190 --> 06:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
municipality will take control of a
 
06:04:31.390 --> 06:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
property I understand there's Preston
 
06:04:34.430 --> 06:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
and some other areas but this is like Mr
 
06:04:36.990 --> 06:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
chair I wasn't far out there I and I
 
06:04:39.270 --> 06:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
think that's the answer I was trying to
 
06:04:41.990 --> 06:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
coax which is the real intent of the
 
06:04:44.830 --> 06:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
people who are voting to itl it's not oh
 
06:04:46.990 --> 06:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
it's just unworkable we can't do it it's
 
06:04:49.390 --> 06:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
we don't actually we want corporations
 
06:04:53.990 --> 06:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
to own the homes and so well I I'm I'm
 
06:04:56.110 --> 06:04:56.120 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna hesitate you to imply intent
 
06:04:57.868 --> 06:04:57.878 align:start position:0%
on why we're voting the way we're voting
 
06:04:59.750 --> 06:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm what I'm saying the only
 
06:05:01.350 --> 06:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
point that I was making and I wasn't
 
06:05:03.750 --> 06:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
directing it at the chair but at the
 
06:05:06.468 --> 06:05:06.478 align:start position:0%
comments I had heard already which is is
 
06:05:08.910 --> 06:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
in General on any Bill anytime that
 
06:05:10.750 --> 06:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
you're a legislator I think it's bad
 
06:05:13.990 --> 06:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
faith to say well I agree with the
 
06:05:15.350 --> 06:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
intent but I just don't want to do the
 
06:05:17.110 --> 06:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
work I think we should do the work on
 
06:05:18.910 --> 06:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
anything that we agree on the intent on
 
06:05:21.070 --> 06:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
and so if if you don't like the intent
 
06:05:22.990 --> 06:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
then just say that which the chair was
 
06:05:24.390 --> 06:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
willing to do and I think the chair I
 
06:05:27.270 --> 06:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
don't like the intent all right
 
06:05:28.830 --> 06:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks then representative
 
06:05:31.708 --> 06:05:31.718 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um I just think that
 
06:05:33.990 --> 06:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
voting on this so quickly is a reason I
 
06:05:37.750 --> 06:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
cannot support the I representative
 
06:05:40.510 --> 06:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
Gibbs um I'm not going to tell you why I
 
06:05:42.310 --> 06:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
think anybody else is voting one way or
 
06:05:44.190 --> 06:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
another I'm just going to tell you why
 
06:05:46.150 --> 06:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote no and it's for a
 
06:05:48.430 --> 06:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
reason very similar to representative
 
06:05:50.708 --> 06:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
Hicks that I think we should have taken
 
06:05:53.070 --> 06:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
some time to think about this rather
 
06:05:55.230 --> 06:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
than voting on it immediately after the
 
06:05:55.240 --> 06:05:56.110 align:start position:0%
than voting on it immediately after the
public

06:05:56.110 --> 06:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
public
 
06:05:59.030 --> 06:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
hearing thank
 
06:06:01.548 --> 06:06:01.558 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
06:06:04.510 --> 06:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
Aon uh I'm going to vote to itl this
 
06:06:06.830 --> 06:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
bill because there's just too many
 
06:06:10.548 --> 06:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
problems with it every mom and pop LLC
 
06:06:14.070 --> 06:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
would be prohibited from buying a house
 
06:06:16.670 --> 06:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
and so I I think there's a lot of flaws
 
06:06:19.868 --> 06:06:19.878 align:start position:0%
to this bill representative um Dumont
 
06:06:19.878 --> 06:06:21.390 align:start position:0%
to this bill representative um Dumont
then

06:06:21.390 --> 06:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:06:23.350 --> 06:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
bolo I would just like to say for me
 
06:06:25.150 --> 06:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
personally I'm going to be voting to itl
 
06:06:26.310 --> 06:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that being is I've
 
06:06:27.708 --> 06:06:27.718 align:start position:0%
had more than one day to review this
 
06:06:31.070 --> 06:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
bill uh we've all had so thank you
 
06:06:33.910 --> 06:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
represent buolo uh I Echo representative
 
06:06:35.868 --> 06:06:35.878 align:start position:0%
dumont's comments and I would also add
 
06:06:37.350 --> 06:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of a lot has been said
 
06:06:38.788 --> 06:06:38.798 align:start position:0%
well okay well we need to work on this
 
06:06:40.070 --> 06:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
and that the fact is we only have so
 
06:06:41.628 --> 06:06:41.638 align:start position:0%
much time in the session time is at a
 
06:06:44.548 --> 06:06:44.558 align:start position:0%
premium time is you know of the essence
 
06:06:46.788 --> 06:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
and we have a lot of really big issues
 
06:06:48.788 --> 06:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
before us so the amount of time that
 
06:06:50.670 --> 06:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
would take to try to fix this language
 
06:06:52.190 --> 06:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
when there's already disagreements about
 
06:06:53.670 --> 06:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
the fundamental premise I think we need
 
06:06:55.468 --> 06:06:55.478 align:start position:0%
to economize our time and we need to
 
06:06:57.510 --> 06:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
actually get good things done
 
06:06:57.520 --> 06:06:59.670 align:start position:0%
actually get good things done
representative

06:06:59.670 --> 06:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:07:03.110 --> 06:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
Reed well I understand time is
 
06:07:06.468 --> 06:07:06.478 align:start position:0%
a a um a scarcity and we all have
 
06:07:07.910 --> 06:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
bandwidth especially considering we're
 
06:07:11.150 --> 06:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
not paid right so um having said that we
 
06:07:13.468 --> 06:07:13.478 align:start position:0%
don't have all that many bills compared
 
06:07:15.948 --> 06:07:15.958 align:start position:0%
to some committees and this is this is
 
06:07:18.150 --> 06:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
the biggest issue and I don't think that
 
06:07:19.708 --> 06:07:19.718 align:start position:0%
any of us should be asking going around
 
06:07:21.628 --> 06:07:21.638 align:start position:0%
asking people to vote for us asking for
 
06:07:24.070 --> 06:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
this position and this title unless
 
06:07:25.910 --> 06:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to take this
 
06:07:28.830 --> 06:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
seriously um now if you want to talk
 
06:07:30.670 --> 06:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
about well do we want to include mom and
 
06:07:32.708 --> 06:07:32.718 align:start position:0%
pop llc's because that's really honestly
 
06:07:34.910 --> 06:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
the majority of owners are these llc's
 
06:07:36.910 --> 06:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
that it's just one person that owns like
 
06:07:39.910 --> 06:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
a bunch of different nine Maple Street
 
06:07:42.110 --> 06:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
LLC um or do we want to include
 
06:07:45.230 --> 06:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
nonprofits all of that is the work if
 
06:07:47.030 --> 06:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
you don't agree with the underlying
 
06:07:49.468 --> 06:07:49.478 align:start position:0%
intent as the chair has aptly stated
 
06:07:53.310 --> 06:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
then say that don't say well you know we
 
06:07:54.590 --> 06:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
could change this language but I don't
 
06:07:55.948 --> 06:07:55.958 align:start position:0%
want to work and take the time to change
 
06:07:58.868 --> 06:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
the language it's a huge issue 30 yes it
 
06:08:01.708 --> 06:08:01.718 align:start position:0%
was like 1% of of of houses are owned by
 
06:08:04.670 --> 06:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
Blackstone but 30% are owned by some
 
06:08:07.110 --> 06:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
sort of corporate like it's not owned by
 
06:08:11.110 --> 06:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
people and so it's a huge huge issue so
 
06:08:13.030 --> 06:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
if if it's about the llc's or the
 
06:08:15.190 --> 06:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
nonprofits or what's an entity or does
 
06:08:17.670 --> 06:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
it go back to the municipal like let's
 
06:08:20.230 --> 06:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
do the work I'm here for the work and
 
06:08:21.628 --> 06:08:21.638 align:start position:0%
I'm getting paid the same as everybody
 
06:08:24.590 --> 06:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
else here but if it's not that and it's
 
06:08:26.788 --> 06:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
just actually we're fine with
 
06:08:28.310 --> 06:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
corporations buying up all the houses
 
06:08:32.430 --> 06:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
then fine say that that's my point okay
 
06:08:35.190 --> 06:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
point taken so at this point I'm going
 
06:08:37.788 --> 06:08:37.798 align:start position:0%

06:08:40.830 --> 06:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
